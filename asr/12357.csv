278.22,1259.31, monorail to a camera telamon blueberries i long have you been here in front a city hall said ten days can you tell me about your hunger strike well i've been camping out here at the hunger stump outside of city hall i am out here for humoring justice i have three resolutions that i am asking for a local officials in the portland area to approve of so that we can make sure that our features prosperous and we also take care of the most tunable and vitality matthat is posciandra what are your proposition my first request is for christendom to communicate with the bereavement services and with all the fines of of right to dream too there is a rest area on forth and burnside's been there for about seven months and as the private lot as been there for about a decade the corners for senator store that got torn down as of a fire to violations for that they had food vendors on it and there was held to violations and so the food vendors were gone and the city's basely no not loud the owners see that lot for any commercial basis and so they talked to organized from danyell there has been this camp ground that's been by the portland airport for about ten years and the two bowed up to land they benefactor the house second betsie and has been robertson years hasn't been a problem community and be they had some logic from there to their latinitatis up another you know model of this you know independent government free now living space and they probably hold around forty people who would probably living on the streets otherwise and side the lot and their complete productive they clean the streets they petrolite crime they have never had a single business complain about them in the area and the city's currently finding them again for convolution and it's kind of ridiculous contradictory colour that were are seventeen year of our ten year plan and homelessness the city has the mitta does not have the ability to take care of the two thousand people who are living on the streets or the five thousand people who are crackless whether on the streets whether in shelters or another situation and so now i here on hunger strike asking for the support of an almond to withdraw these fines and to allow this creative and successful way to adjust homelessness to be able to continue its work and provide for the most venerable my second resolution is about a house in love which we talked about for over a decade here important the house in motley just a form it is request to voters to take money out of property taxes now catoctin and you can have leverrier all kinds of stuff a house and lovelessly raise funds for the housing barante cover nineteen various tasks whether its building new forehoofs giving short terminated so you know low income families or it also does help people with counseling cotyorites they like that the coloration dollars that's where it comes from and it's a real unreliable source the courtlander property taxes through even renewed on how much a forbearing and it's not really reliable mechanism and it's not even a concrete one consideration that binding law asmodean so i believe that we need to use in leeuwarden source of revenue that we will be able to project a project accurately and rely on when it comes to housing projects in the future and a third resolution is not a more torminosus the sherifs office they currently are the ones who enforce the fictions that base give when it comes to foreclosing up proprement pay the mortgage and you know bannochar amounts of fraudulent loans is predatory lending or retarded people of color and for families and giving them mortgages that are can't be recalculated and just this year the bamman and both the organ legislator they've passed resolutions legislation that holds basanta blenavon's andenmatten active response from what officials defenders right therefore to come out it seems like holy your passion for others is quite inspiring what drives your passionate is mottisfont's watch happen and i take personal cantabili for the welfare of humanity knowing how at some places i've been blessed so much and other times no i could have had a better life and keeping both those things in mind keeps me dedicated to using my intention in a way that brodersen ve of others and tried to bring together a collective the people going to work now and tranquility and provide the ascent that we all need for our survival if turnabout for you impenetrable come down or get online emotion justice and also communicate with no elected officials in the areas because they only represent the people who actually are willing to step up and be present love for you to give a callisthenes palestine can talk about and it's only going to be settled pressure now i can't keep some out here because it's not going to be enough thereabout one young african american male who dying on their doorstep weeping this really matters and we have to get rid of our perception of homelessness and you know alternately smooth as probably miss perception that lapham here for how suggests for the entire work in class of poor and the homeless i have experienced chronicles or first came to portland i am currently in a living situation that a comfortable with so i don't have to be out here right now and i've never had this sleep outside against my will and so is really important that people who are so so workers or housing advocates they really know from perseverence what is like to be out here you know cause before i read the articles i hear testimonies i watch documentaries but as the polander world once you actually go there in ten live for a little bit and it's something that i would never want to wish on anybody you have to go through because it's just it's a burden on your soul how long have you been with occupied i have been here since the very first march ought to resist i camped out and chapman square all thirty nine plus days and so i did a lot of organizing and many marches and i helped with monopolisation and i can get a lot of speeches and i participated in facilitated a few workshops and general semblant so i definitely social of my time and skill to help build the movement i feel like i am now is the lot distant from where the ottomans is you know i am still at her with icicles that i'm trying to achieve a really trying to use a pen that is much more receptive to the needs of the miners what is the best thing you see from occupy the biography or what occupies to the breathing of his one renovate best thing probably was that very first marched ten thousand people in the streets you know there happy to be together and tis a day for of speeches and inspiration and lose the first time we really started having the dialogue about you know any quality and what we could do about it and very first marchese that i hope we are able to find ourselves doing again what is your hope droopy hopes were occupied is that it matures and it realizes that adaptation is the only means of survival and that no matter how big a movement has been asked to learn how to address the externality of your environment and to act appropriately alive something that still hasn't folly been able to achieve yet and so what happened october isn't the same as what needs to happen in the summer and i hope that people are able to remove themselves to be involved and also to try verity of tactics that will bring more people and to know whatever we choose to address in the future what is america means to you america is it's a country and country with millionaire who so much individuality probably more than any other lamentation don't mean as much to america as i used to so consenting that you would like to say whatever it is on your mind that you would like people at home on the other end of his camera looked to know acalan thing that's on your mind the struggling right now not easy to note now to my body but the harder of my soul and that is carouses even though i know that here in this space right now the change that needs to happen is nowhere close seawell have to find petulancies us now to be indeed in involved you might find it from someone else my fiance i yourself with pleasure to find what fires you because i need you and the world need you we need each other missus beginning at the end where performer in the middle and we need a little bit more push to get us to real fulfillment and the hollywood i would have to say now please don't what this just be a video too please let it be
