0.36,133.95, he my name is josh martin in one of the passes here sonia so glad you guys are here even though last night didn't go so as to want to say go cushionlike man i don't talk about it okay eh my loyalty remains so i also want to say what's up to the vain video it is always go vandals as well and then recently knew you like right now now we want to say go wild cats and with substantial washington university and elsewhere a crazy stuff happened last week in ellensburg and i'm so excited that god is doing amazing things there and he's densher and it's as if he's up to something as if god wants to change the world or something right crazy i'm glad you're here where in a sermon series called never the same in last week we looked an interaction cheeses had for the woman caught in a dull tree and we said very simply to get caught and to get christ and to get no condemnation in that moment it is a moment you never forget you never the same after that so that woman in that story man the day in the dirt with jesus affected everything for her and as she walked away change she walked away never the same lies what we hope in the story now if we're not careful to day we see the services never the same we go healest week we can tell the story you may jesus you change came over what's the next services what what else are we going to learn because you and i grew up around fairy tales and fairy till says what happened that woman she lived a believer after ritner saw snow white fight with the prince that you never saw these people get back from their honeymoon and have an issue right trickiest in general it's like yeah it's like we go away and have happily ever after a nervous for us because of that some nervous restoratives and i'm almost nervous in the sermon not only from very tis but because of face book no i'm not not the face book hater guy but i will say this if we're not careful we think may okay happily ever after is what i'm going to get and secondarily were not very good with stuff that takes a while
134.01,247.92, that line we don't like anything that's long we like instant messaging instant grating snap chatting hundred and forty characters and then a board riever one in the room is super busy but now that busy but multitudine but thinking about what's going on and got a lot going going on in the head you are busy and bore you don't keep commitments will i don't keep commitments while we struggle with this and if we're not careful we take fear very tales and face book into our relationship with christ and that is completely at odds with a way god intends to move us in a mature of cannot take that mentality into what we're talking about today because we said last week as god can verdure makes us a christian but that is not god's and game for his conversion is not the end god's and game for you is christ likeness that takes a while you don't in to gram christ slyness immediately right you don't go a conversion no christian now like christ there's a process in the middle there called cultivation it is a slow process and illustration on us it's not a microwave it's a crock pot yes familiar with crackpots it's like crackpots right now my wife has some recipes we were looking it up and i found last nineteen four hour poor crackpot recipe sounds incredible abrupto are you kidding me twenty four hours in the crocodilian smell it like every six i don't know but this turns into this right this is the sandwich that you received everybody's hunger now why cause crackpots work magic i don't know what they do in there
248.19,251.28, in their stern and we're not looking i don't know
251.7,261.51, magical things happen in the crock but i also found something online and this is much more you and i is why i think the servants going to be harris because this is what we prefer
262.56,266.22, the tangy barbecue poured hot pocket
266.25,336.96, i think some in the river like i didn't know how pocket had a tiny barbecue pork i'm a i'm a hit up the wal mart after this and go looking if you are more interested in the hot pocket than you are in the crock put you need a pull out some notes because i have something for you said he this is very very different this is a microsis crackpot christianity is overtaking about today and when you walked and you got a tesseract some of you remember these if you're old enough to you are the bicameral with the question how many licks as it takes to get to the middle of stiteroom that commercial and the kid can't do it right it ees bidental like a man let me do it and they all take it it rapparees one too and that he bites it and a handsome to the king and goes it too it takes two legs to get to the bottom of the tierce one knows that's not true but the principle remains dudn't have the endurance to get there that's what is talking about so they trick you into buying one these etrier single on you in here is like manometer seven before said the enormity right some of you in the room right now already bidden into your tosabo and so if that's for you also break out your notes because we need to talk
337.26,341.13, because listen from conversion
341.19,389.55, from my creed a crackpot from conversion to christ likeness is a process called cultivation from conversion to christ like is this process this life long process of cultivation because listen god changed you yes god is changing you yes god will change you yes god save you done god is saving you absolutely true god will save you yes lassie talked about saving grace this woman was saved by christ to see an talk about sustaining grace the ability to get into the crock pot of christianity and go for a while the ability to endure
389.64,406.74, all temptation says don't endure take the short cut so what we're going to do today is look at the life of peter so you have a bible on the grab it you're going to turn to john chapter twenty one you keep your bible open for a while because before we get to john twenty one i have to tell you the story of peter
406.89,421.38, as this word cultivate means to prepare us to develop us to move us around so that we might be used to nurture us and no one in the bible is more cultivated
421.41,422.76, peter
422.88,500.55, he was cultivated he was changed he went from this to that he went from conversion to christ lisita process we get to read about in the gospels the very very clear that we see the ups we see the downs we see the whole process as it plays out so if you were going to write a book about peter omnibus selling novel about peter it would be called this it would be called you don't get to skip a step one man's journey from denier to defend her from faithless to faithful from powerless to powerful from fishermen to fisher of men from walking on water to drowning in water to walking on water again from acting like satan to acting like the saviour from being simon to becoming peter you don't get to the skiffs would be the natalie your whole cover right tessie's going to graphically design that title josh i don't know but peter is this fisherman but he becomes the leader of the disciples on school is on educated his passion his outspoken his aggressive is quick to speak he's always first but there was no one that was more freshness friend they grew up around the same time there about the same age and state tell you it is be careful becoming jesus his friend because he's going to take you somewhere
500.64,508.38, the story of jesus's best friend and how he takes him somewhere the story starts for that video picks up
508.5,512.13, he comes out on the shore in a colchonero
512.13,541.68, rock rock that's going to my care that that was good little inside so he says down the rock and he says have you caught anything and yet you put that away in your memory that little joke of hey have you caught anything like jesus didn't know he had caught anything right so have you caught any thing imputed not in there's nothing out here pettiness what are you take it on an we go fishing again and peter he's not peter yet his name is simon at this point in the story he looks at jesus and in my head i think he goes he retorted
542.01,561.06, you tell em how to fish i don't you like make stuff with rocks and wood i know how to fish i'm actually cleaning my net so done for the day but if you say we'll go back out there so he goes back out there and any throws the net down you saw it and he pulls in a massive catch a fish and in that moment she is as is your name is peter now
561.48,595.83, simon any more the word simon means water slippery it ketched in the word peter means rock it means peruses the foundation the concrete the powerful and the one that's unbreakable this other thing is fluid moves around who knows you're not simon any more your peter now and we don't fish fish any more we fish people now so right where we start peter is met right where he's not met in the temple is not met in the church he met right where he is on a boat and jesus meet somewhere is
596.04,646.32, tell them the truth about who he is a man i know your simon and i got a lot to you as true of you kinsha it watch her mouth some like custine a sailor that's a real thing simon shall as you're goin to be peter now and we're going to go somewhere with this story of god me to right where he is god tells him the truth about who he is and this is the part that i need is to catch god's seize peter with the end in mind in other words god looked at you in all your imperfections and all your simonne and sees you how he intends you we can't even get our head around that but god sees you right now as he intends you later and that's the story of peter that's where begins and then from there you have these three defining moments in peter's life on a fly through solingen to john chapter twenty one but the first one is when peter walks on water with cheeses
646.53,666.12, jesus tells the man had disciples getting the boat on the other side jesus praise for a while a huge storm comes jesus walks through the storm on the water listen i know it's like a story i think about that precher walking on water through the storm and the scripture says he intended to walk right by the disciples
666.24,705.93, he's not even exciteth up to keep i don't know but i say he's going to walk out bolometer cries out to him and says is that you lord if it's you call me out on the water with you now what a high moment for peter like i think that she is is he caused me ongoloo jesus says yes it's me come out and peter gets out of the boat like steps on to the water and it's not water any more it's like the word of crisis spoken it becomes solid peter ses walking out to him and after a few steps when in the waves there they confuse peter he takes his eyes off christianstad to sink now it's interesting in the stories he's close enough to jesus that when he follows the describes an pick him up
705.96,717.15, notes and so often we want to throw peter under the blessed year peter oh man i walk two steps and then he almost drowned alike what is that story was called the eleven disciples who straight up stayed in the boat
717.33,724.23, what a story was called two people in human history walked on water and one of them peter
724.26,770.25, it is like wow what a high what high for pete walked out there and jesus pulled him back up gets him back on the water and he says man peter why you doubt yet a little faith in misfortune it doesn't mean small it doesn't mean wrong quantity the word little man's duration peter your duration of faith wasn't long enough you want my crown me alas open crack pot you told me could make it and the duration of your faith was too small oh peter you most sir but i got you get up at getting a book and they make that happen natatory of him walking on water the next story is when jesus is rebuked by peter hilarious and jesus rebukes peter back so this is the story jesus comes to a docile and he says he who is everyone say that i am
770.64,816.42, and they say men some say you john the baptist some city our lives and then he asked who do you say that i am pluralite disciples and peter stands up first leader best friend peter says i believe not we i believe you're the christ you are the son of the living god and jesus looks openers bless it are you peter for god revealed that to you and upon you peter upon the rock of your confession upon your life and my life and who i am as a saviour and who you are as the leader upon this rock i will build my church oh man would a high right jesus just looked at peter said a pawn you i will build my church powerful moment incredible high i wish i was lying to you for verses later in the bible
816.6,843.57, like flood about the lake i don't know if you assert that it is done a church on me i'm not sure we churches sounds awesome it's going to be on me right alistening or not that's what's going on and then for relater jesus says i'm going to be handed over to me and i'm going to be killed and that's the way my kingdom is going to come into the world and peter a little bit proud stand up in front of jesus as that will never be so and rebukes jesus and jesus looks at back at him as i then you give behind me satan
843.99,845.58, no we're doing
845.58,867.72, well i will build my church on you get behind me satan that's for branding that was best for verses in the bible peter's feeling good about himself calls out jesus never do that by the way just never call out this is right that your noah's escombe if you're going to act like say no one to call you out
867.78,878.58, rebuke me about what i'm doing my mission is going to the cross for the sins of the world the few say you're not interested in that and you can get behind me satan because i'm goin to miss
878.64,935.43, so what a high high what a low low and then lastly you have the denial a peter denying jesus and jesus reinstating peter john chapter twenty one so there in the garden a gesinde jesus is up their praying peter there and he tells you as men alderwith you i'll do it ever takes me with you i'm in to the end jesus leaning to deny me three times and peter's it will never happen so jesus was praying peterhouse becomes awake peter do pray with me comatose boys and goes back and praise and petrifies again finally duering in the betrayers and they're going to capture cheeses in peter in all of his courage pulls out a sword and shops a geyser of and stands between the crowd and jesus is this you're not going to get to discuss ear off the courage like i will die for you i don't know how the story plays out but somehow jesus like fines the ear in the dark and put it back on the gushed
936.09,940.68, puts it on his head moves his hand and then the ear is now staying there
940.86,943.86, this it was like and the ears back
943.86,947.16, i tell peter man put away the sword i told you about this
947.19,955.08, going for i don't know how you arrest a man that just put your back on but they arrest him and they take him in saltatory
955.38,969.36, the sun is obviously falsely tried wrongly accused great evil being done against jesus but it's always god's plan to send christ to the cross and peter's kind of hide and out saying what's going on and he realized in an jess going to die for this
969.45,987.75, and then he's no longer courageous he's a huge coward and again i wish i was lying to you there is a junior high girl at a fire pit to look at peter and says weren't you one of his disciples and he had cares cusses added junior high girl and says no i wasn't with him i don't even know him get away from me
987.87,993.75, so from chopping a guy's ear off to not being able to stand up to a junior high girl
994.17,1010.25, that high lo i led that's the story peter denied jesus three times the rooster crows and scripture says peter weeps bitterly i he goes away and this grieved in a spirit and he weeps bitterly in the story picks up and john after twenty one
1010.4,1012.5, back fishing
1012.53,1033.14, where the sore start fishing jesses up he caught anything no casson the other side massive catch a fish or napier now you're going to fillimore no going to catch fish and catch me so the very thing jesus called peter out of peter went back into because he thinks he's a failure some in is to hear that this morning the very thing god called you out if you went back to because you failed
1034.07,1052.31, maybe i'm the one overdone that but you were called out of something and because you failed because you mess up you go all just go back to it at actually didn't have a plan for me turns out he was lying dead halibut he probably lied about me said peter goes back to fishing in the story picks up and john chapter twenty one
1052.79,1056.12, if you're there with me
1056.21,1070.31, i don't always think the bible is funny but i think this is super funny what happens here i don't try to read the bible like it's funny but i think this is jesus pranking the disciples i think jesus raised from the dead and pranks the disciples
1071.42,1093.59, okay i'll read surges revealed again to the capes of the stairs and he revealed himself in this way simper thomas called the tontine cannondale sensitivity in the rochester together carriage her same apter says he we're going to go fishing isbister peters iligan fish don't waukeesis i killed him an i don't know
1093.86,1100.67, to go back to fishing because that's what i was doing before this whole thing might be off so let's go back to fishing
1100.7,1115.73, and so he is an influence or so boy goes with him and just as day was breaking jesus stood on the shore then never fore yet the dissiples did not know as him and jesus said with a smirk on his face joshed you guys catch anything
1116.45,1184.07, and he got no having canting and with the smart contact with great joy and his disciples jesus looks at miss he will then cast the net on the right side of the boat and you'll find some and the tigers have to be gone the guitar the disaster redeemer that they say tell her not on the right side of the book i've heard that before so they cast it and now they were not able to hold it in because of the quantity of fish in the disciple whom jesus loved therefore said a persian saying the peter it is the lord it's jesus he got us again is jesus he told us the fisher he got us again that's where the story started and now were back again and this is crazy it is the lord and when simon peter heard it was the lord he put on clothes funny to me he put on his outer care because he was stripped down sees like only were under some say puts on his clothes and he throws himself in so the sea i don't know if he's like manassas we walked on water once we're going to this again he repudiates at a run to you i don't know why you put clothes on before you jump in the sea may be thought i was going to just sprint there or whatever 
1184.16,1200.18, the other disciples came in dragging the net full of fish behind him for there not for all and about a hundred yards off so peter sees the one who is denied i sees the same miracle that this whole thing started with and he jumps into the water he can not even wait to get to jesus
1200.27,1220.58, and then you have jesus here in a head charcoal had fireplace in the fish villeton him bread and he said and bring home the fish you just caught so some apter went aboard hauled the net ashore full of large fists a hundred fifty three somebody counted underfoot and although there were so many the net was not torn and she's a satanic and have breakfast now this there's an elephant in the room
1220.7,1230.78, simon peter denied jesus three times another bag jesus had risen from the dead to cook breakfast for the god that denied him
1231.08,1237.62, the story so they knew they didn't want to talk about it really but in verse when they had finished breakfast
1237.92,1241.91, he said to simon peter listen the word used as he says simon
1241.97,1244.67, a computer
1244.76,1246.29, soon
1246.68,1278.3, some of john do you love me more than these onslaughts cycles he's talking about fishing do you love me more than a job why are you back your call goethes pro do you love me more than these he said yes lord you know that i love you he said to him well then feed my lambs were out fishing any more peter second time he said to him simon and john do you love me and he said to him yes lord you know that i love you and then he said to him then to my sheep and i said to him a third time how many times a peter deny three times
1278.42,1307.01, said me yes onion covered simonov me yes he now two covered last time he sassination do you love me and peter was grieved as the same phrase that it happened after the nowhere in a speretuals he said i with her tongue do you love me and peter said in leeson everything and you know that i love you and then jesus said to him will than feed my sheep peter
1307.13,1325.07, shepherd now you're not a fisherman now you don't fish any more you fish men now and the verse eighteen truly truly i said to you when you were young used to dress yourself and walk over you want it but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will dress shot and carry you where you don't want to go and this he said to show the kind of death
1325.31,1332.72, he was to go if i got and after saying this he said to him again i would add follow me
1333.02,1351.68, what the story start cast your net down pick it up your name's peter follow me you not simon any more follow me so so what does this story in you've got this picture again follow me were not doing fish any more listen peter i know you failed but the mission remains
1351.83,1358.61, i know you fail i was there i know you denied you have not lost your position in the mission
1358.67,1377.48, some back here raised from the dead telling you again follow me follow me quit acting like simon your peter now simon fishes peter fishes men peter is a shepherd these are very different to the ashes cultivation process the jesus doesn't give up on peter
1377.6,1389.3, because i know he's converted but is trying to make him like christ this cultivation process is this life long process live long process of continually being called out and called on
1389.3,1422.9, continually and called out allowing on water he come out here called out you see but get up i'm going to call on you what about the rebuke jesus for but peter to cause them out so that was so he could call on him next thing the denial totally calls them out so that what he can call on him so our lives we were not careful they looked like this roller coaster we think were not progressing were not moving anywhere we see this like an down of and down and up and deteriorates up and down and up and down up and down if you take the middle line there you go in i'm not getting anywhere i need us to reject that
1423.38,1424.94, receive
1424.94,1462.59, god's view of this process which has a slight upward leading the yeere going up and we're going down we're going up when we're going down but this is not a roller coaster this is an escalator you see what this looks like the looks like steps not this was lagoda taking us somewhere there's a not it's not just up and down up an out o poor melbourne no god has the end in mind when he called you at the beginning he converted you said that he might call to the yuma you like christ god desires to do this in you do you want to allow him to do that 
1462.71,1480.26, fifty days after this do you love me yes i lived my sheep fifty days after that peter stands up at pentecost pentecost is the gigantic party thrown between the harvesting of wheat and the harvesting of bart bartley it is modern day marty grow
1480.47,1554.96, and peter stands up at marty grow and preaches a sermon the first distinctly christian sermon in human history the first sermon about a crucified christ and a resurrected crises stands up and preaches a sermon and this is the profound this is the inauguration the very first time the holy spirit of god is going to collide with the world and intellectual of the holy spirit ran in the world is the sermon preached by peter are you kidding me unqualified unschooled fisherman stands up and marry draw and stars preaching and the holy spirit blows that place up and three thousand people get saved three thousand men like five thousand people probably become christians because why because jesus told him upon human bill my church upon your confession of me not you peter but the way you lead the way you talk about may there's a process that is happening and peter is going to get to pentecost jesus called peter's fishermen knowing he was going to get to pentecost but he knew that in order to get him to some place he had to allow him to become some one
1555.59,1558.2, if god's goin to take you to some place
1558.92,1568.34, leadership this future all that peter was headed towards he couldn't get somewhere without jesus making him into some one the whole point of this process
1568.49,1575.9, as the god absolutely has a plan for your life and it is absolutely pointed to somewhere
1575.99,1590.09, that is not the primary point the point is when i get you to somewhere i want you to have become someone before you get there so in other words some of you in this room have more lifting than you have character
1590.57,1603.26, i with that you can get up and lead you can get up and be followed you can get up and speak you can get up and do some stuff you have a ton of gifting but no character you have the gifting a peter but the character simon
1603.5,1617.9, and she is so i'm not okay with that if i'm going to give you somewhere i want you to have the character to back it up if you're going to be on stage i want to test you in the shadows before you get spotlight this is this process of cultivation
1617.9,1621.53, this fisherman changed the world
1621.92,1627.62, change the world how did you change the world i think it's so simple i think he never failed
1628.25,1635.69, never like in the story you see all these inconsistencies the only consistency in peter story as that he was always by jesus
1635.96,1647.09, inconsistent inconsistent inconsistent almost as if to say god's okay with your inconsistently gods okay with your inconsistencies as long as your consistently by god when you're inconsistent
1647.42,1663.26, jacintha god is okay if you will walk near to him if you will not be on him if you will allow him to call to the you in to some one while he takes you to some place then there is no end to what god can do in you
1664.04,1669.14, i agree to the crock pot and reject the microwave god has a chance to do something
1669.65,1683.36, often this cultivation process is short circuited it killed it slowed down and so i rode three things that kill the cultivation process the number one thing that i think kills the cultivation process is comparison
1683.57,1700.28, the fear of man the god wants to do something and god was to take you somewhere out west to make you and to some one with so awesome often the fear of man overwhelms you because you're so filled with comparison i do you realize the gods story for you has nothing to do with god story for other people
1700.97,1704.78, really got story for you is uniquely for you
1704.78,1718.19, a god has something for you that has nothing to do with other people and the rest of john twenty one like after this whole feed my sheep do you love me and syne peter and john i give thing and jesus looks i say peter looks at easiest about john
1718.49,1724.58, john going to do what's john story and jesus liberata is nothing to do with you
1724.88,1730.52, and he's almost sarcastic he's like i can let john live forever never die and that would have nothing to do with you peter
1730.85,1736.97, on what i have for you is for you i don't have it for someone else
1737.78,1759.5, and this is awful for us as comparison game i was so bad in college like i want to christian college and my freshman year i got kicked out of the ministry leadership timasion because of my issues with my leader and by the way my leader was a fifty five year old incredibly godly man that i constantly cut undercut and constantly thought i was better than him
1759.56,1779.6, how in the world did i think that i don't know but as eighteen year old he invited me off the team great move good leader right cause i was more poison than it was helpful inviting me off the team and as a twenty seven year old aftercourse for while they invited me back to preach at a college and i went into his office and he just had this huge like laughter smile on his face
1779.75,1793.7, i remember when i keep you out of my so sorry for that i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i've been i've been leading some stuff now and it's superadded i'm so sorry i treated how he just laughs like yeah you've been beat up now you understand what it's like
1794.03,1800.24, but so often men were over confident some of you go to class the can you can teach better than your teacher
1800.51,1804.62, like a wise my communication tinshemeth man i could totally do this better
1804.89,1808.07, some of you go to village thinking you could leave better than your village leader
1808.73,1830.66, not a dead some you have such over confidence in some of you go the other way it is under confidence you you get invited and the leadership because people see something in you that god's really doing and you're walking and cultivation and someone calls it out of you and you get under valued and you feel this sense of under confidence and you do not and never do that because a comparison
1831.08,1838.46, the cultivated you hear not allowing him to do because you have no confidence in your not walking and what god would have for you
1839.42,1842.63, something for you and has nothing to do with anyone else
1843.02,1850.73, you allow him to cultivate that in you without comparing yourself to others the second thing is perfection this is the fear of failure
1851.0,1855.53, you don't believe and i don't i struggle to believe
1855.53,1859.46, god is writing a future for me despite my failures
1860.03,1873.35, we struggle it that this is the beauty of peters story that he never failed you and i fail one time would bail we go back fishing and we never want to hear from the lord again god is riding a future now despite your failures
1873.38,1916.82, we don't think the god celebrates our process we don't think the gods okay with us learning slowly we've got to believe that how many of you in the room are around have a niece and nephew cousin whatever this is one or two years old like a baby having anybody okay you've been around them have you ever seen the parents of that baby i have an eleven month old you ever never been he house and seemed this but like be reading the newspaper not on a pad but like a real old school newspaper like reading the newspaper and there thirty month old tries to take a step right first step and they see that baby take a step and then the baby falls down and they look over from their newspaper and go really one step that's all you got cable you my kid have you ever seen that
1916.88,1928.94, now what do you see i like a man holding the baby and like barely letting the baby going at the baby stands for like less than an instant moment they video and put it on line until the whole family
1929.99,1947.69, they celebrate the process last night my daughter was in the bathtub and she took a rubber ducky and put it in a pink cup and smiled at us and we video incanto everybody a rubber dakeyama pink cup she never put anything in anything before
1947.96,1966.44, that was it she loved my sachigo a duck i got a cup and put it in the dock but the duck in the cup and we lost our minds were cheering were stowed osinin the video to the grandparents relic she's a smartest kid in the world look she she puts the thing in there
1968.24,1970.16, you've never seen
1970.85,1990.38, never seen parents not celebrate even as you get older right your years old and you're trying to learn how to drive a standard or stick shift or whatever you call it and you're told the ruin and your dad's transmission but he's not that met his just excited that your learning and your the process and your moving forward than wide do we think god treats us any other way
1990.53,1997.97, so are you in the room of enwalling with cries for a year you just need a quip the rubber ducky and the pink cup and let god celebrates you
1998.27,2022.51, you need do you need i take a step fall down cried little and god like yes you took a step get up you'll take to next time i will celebrate i will video and show the jesus hegesias like you know that is what god is doing for us when peter got out of the boat and took a few steps towards jesus the bible does not say jesus went over and held him under water and said oh my gosh really two steps peter that's all you got
2023.08,2029.47, say that it is he immediately pulled them out and he looks at em because man your faith didn't have enough to rate
2029.83,2034.81, out peter i why you do you are you are told me there you could have made it
2034.81,2038.92, right here with you totally comeback for you figure this out
2039.25,2044.05, why do we think perfection is what god is after listen you
2044.56,2055.39, are not your sin you are not your sin you are not your failures you cannot be perfect and that's really good news because jesus was perfect so will you buy into the process
2055.63,2059.44, you be where you are and what you celebrate where you are
2059.92,2063.01, you realize that this is all a part of the process
2063.52,2066.73, last thing that kills cultivation is short cuts
2066.97,2088.03, the words the fear of never i think in relationship some of you in the room or like man i am single and i'm never going to be with somebody and so if any guy even looks at me kind o i will date i will marry him i will be with him right now because i'm never ever ever going to get out of this and you don't allow the lord to cultivate you in that time
2088.24,2108.73, i graduated from a christian college without a girl friend that is hard to do cause everybody trying to get together so part of me is like well that's cool also well something wrong with me like why these girls not chinaware so ah that is not easy
2108.88,2145.54, in that listen in that season i look back on those journals lots of turning back i look back on those journals a gomangani preparing me for something cold is cultivating me for something god was getting me ready for my wife god was doing some stuff in me i needed to not take a short cut and that time i told you a story manchuria my wife and i three years to get pregnant nine hundred days of praying for that god was cold to hating something in us so that now when our daughter takes a rubber duck and put it in a pink cup we lose our mind because it's uninured days to get their gavaulling something he knew where he was taking us and he didn't let us take a short cut
2145.81,2162.1, why are you so quick to get out of that why don't you just be where you are why are you just learning where you're watching a man in waiting some of you can't even wait to have second till you get married because you think you're never going to get married you can never do this and now you you you're walking and sin because you're afraid
2162.61,2171.49, you think the gods not for you think that god doesn't have a story for you don't think god's cultivating you don't think gods moving forward and you will take any short cut imaginable to get there
2171.61,2190.24, and your career you take short cuts you let your character go out the window because you think you need a move on you need this advancement you need this internship you need this future because you need this amount of money you love this kind of life and you take short cuts day after day after day and you don't see where you are and walk in god's character and walk in god's goodness you quickly go to becoming simon
2190.66,2200.89, to be peter you know he did we take short cuts as your pride you don't love the lord to cultivate some of you a ministry you know the gods callouses
2200.95,2211.03, but you have this under abilities under achiever feeling and you're taking the short cut you're taking away out you're like i don't know if he's really called me to that and so you have this under confidence what we just talked about
2211.12,2220.57, some of you others are like my other walking with the lower for like days i feel like i should be a preacher i row you need a calm down you need a rubber duck in a pink up
2220.63,2230.35, i be there for a little pitieth process men when guy came up to me and the quick to hand over their resume it makes me so nervous
2230.35,2238.81, roamed one know your back history and how many people you led for a watery know the guy i love that goes as any place i can serve in the church
2239.08,2242.8, where i could be in the shadows to serving
2243.28,2256.18, that i could just show up and not be seen by anybody because i'm going to process of being cultivated so i don't want the stage spot light yet i want the shadows right now is there now arose i go yes i will hang out with you every single day with them in said
2256.33,2261.64, you seem like the kind of person who wants to be cultivated he wants to move forward
2261.91,2269.92, listen to me god has a plan for you but that plan is a process
2270.13,2277.06, that plan is a process and in the process god reveals his purpose
2277.36,2296.68, god has a plan for you guaranteed no doubt about it he has a plan for you that plan is a process you don't get the overnight don't you dare go hot pocket on me this is not what we're talking about you do not get their overnight and in that process gorove his purpose and cultivate you to become like christ
2296.74,2317.77, so the world can see more people acting like cry so you don't get where you're going without going through some stuff peter pretences with a toneless because he'd been called out ho been called on he been rebuked he'd been roback an he'd been in denied it a defender chapter off that's awesome he done a bunch of stuff and so he stands a pentagon
2318.16,2324.19, and he preached the sermon that nourish whole spirit as a man who had become some one
2325.27,2328.75, could stand in that place as being cultivated
2329.29,2331.96, also wrote a couple of books on the testament
2332.02,2350.35, reason little phrase out here as we closed and it is as this the first peter chapter to say so put away all malice and all the sea and a poison even as and appeared that's who used to be man we're not that any more were never the same get that out of here so put all that stuff away and he like new born infants
2350.38,2366.31, long for pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up in the salvation you may grow up into this if indeed you have tasted that the lord is good peter looks a united do you crave
2366.31,2367.39, he
2367.81,2369.97, your calling
2369.97,2375.67, because my daughter when she's hungry the whole neighborhood no she hunger and peter goes yet like that
2376.09,2389.23, no more baby that cries out to be nursed the cries out to be cultivated the demands change like peter and in the waters like jest you all cry out to you do you and i crave
2389.44,2399.76, do we crave our calling are weak with a pocket a week with this true and on the tintype without are going to reject that today and say no man i'm in for the long haul
2400.15,2403.54, do you know that god has something for you in your sixty
2403.72,2405.73, you can't even imagine that
2405.73,2416.5, the god has something for you there is this cultivation process that he is leading you to he's inviting you until long obedience is inviting you into that process
2416.92,2419.83, you willing to commit to long obedience
2420.22,2421.63, go
2421.93,2435.13, been around the church long enough to see people leave college and they totally bailed the cave to these temptations they quit being cultivated are you willing to buy and long obedience are you willing to fall in love with the process
2435.25,2439.21, are you willing to love the process
2439.21,2448.93, because god's will for your life is not primarily where you end up not primarily if you live on the west side of you have over here you do it's not primarily where not even primarily what you do in your job
2448.99,2458.74, will is not primarily that stuff his will is primarily who you become so that when you get to where you're going and you do what you're doing you who you're supposed to be
2458.8,2466.78, so as people who live never the same we realize that god's will for our life is to make us like jesus
2467.08,2485.14, you get that when we get that we will never be the same peters's grow up into your salvation drew up into it enjoy the process of growing up walk in this for the long hall and then one day you look back and you say praise god i'm not who i used to be but praise god is not done with me yet
2485.14,2497.83, prescott i'm not where i used to be member hengest like that and sound like that and do that and he agesistrata roman noodles are no longer part of my day praise god i'm not here used to be maragon but he's not done with me yet
2497.95,2501.55, a lot more to do in me praise god for that
2503.17,2518.56, this story in john chapter twenty one had actually ends like jesus prophecied tis peter managed going to come a day when people are going to lead you away and people are going to dress you and they're going to take an they're goin to stay out your hands and he's basically talking about peter's eventual death
2518.56,2531.28, church history church historians are too says that peter and his wife this is as a story records that they keep preaching the gospel all the way to the end and they are killed for their faith
2531.31,2535.84, and when they go to be killed that the way they're going to be killed as the crucifixion
2536.17,2549.31, so peter goes there and they take all this close justus's and when they put out his hands to nomothetes asked that they would take his cross and they would slip it upside down because he wouldn't be worthy of dying like jesus
2549.7,2551.08, serious
2551.11,2560.47, that's the story the peter goes if you're going to curse fame like jesus i find that to be high praise but would you flip mine upside down cause i'm not worthy to be like him
2561.4,2591.52, while the cultivation that got it accomplish and peter's life you know the gospel of mark is basically like peter riding and mark are sapete speaking mark riding it down you know the story of mark in the walking on water that peter doesn't tell mark to say that he got out of the boat was in water you know that in the story of mark the waves come jesus walks out and marked his sassages in the boat and comes a storm every other gospel says yeah but also peter got out and walked on water peter tells mark if you're going to ride about jesus leave me out of it
2591.82,2603.64, in a story peter had a chance to be like you not to seven steps that's a actually a stiff jonathas a three but i took he could have done that and said he does he marmadillo me in there
2604.21,2614.41, take me out of the story as a story about jesus is not a story about may do you also know that in the book of mark the words about peter are harshest in the book of mark
2614.77,2624.19, perritaut me go ahead and tell how awful it was how much it denied how much is going on it is a mark of spiritual maturity to lessen yourself to the christ my become greater
2624.82,2626.92, to get yourself out of the way
2627.37,2632.05, this is peter and long obedience walking with christ
2633.01,2636.34, peter was called the rock before he was acting like the rock
2636.61,2670.21, some of you in the stream and god is calling you to something but you have got to make the decision to walk in on obedience you got to make the decision this morning to morrow morning for the rest of your life to reject the quick macrauchenia and do this crackpot slow long lasting long obedience process so that one day you look back and say not only was it changed but i kept changing and my whole life was never the same it wasn't just this moment there was never the same as my whole life there was never the same so could we this morning fall in love with the process
2670.48,2700.48, and lastly could we learn and cry all and call out to the god might cultivate a more like a new born baby cries all from milk would we crowd to god saying change me grow me nourish me affect me moved me to where you want me because in my own i'm not any good would we allow that to happen could be rejected comparison this morning could we reject short cuts as morning came reject perfections morning you got what he had for me and what you want for me and how can i long for that more
2700.57,2710.14, pray that for us and then the band's going to come up for we're going to take communion and continue in worship so he does it just by your head i'm going to pray for us as we move into that
2710.53,2713.53, i loaded this morning we would
2714.22,2717.88, feel and experience your nearness
2718.6,2721.09, got a prey that we would
2721.78,2725.83, rejected temptation to do things fast
2725.86,2730.87, an ape that we would believe that you have something for the long haul for us
2732.55,2742.21, on the room in the morning and were comparing ourselves with others and we are fearful of perfection and were fearful were taking short cuts
2742.72,2745.36, all that stuff to remove
2746.23,2748.63, we moved into a time of communion
2749.11,2753.88, contrast we recognize that christ paid it all
2754.18,2756.13, so that we might have
2757.72,2768.76, that his body was broken and his blood was spilled the we might have life color distorting effect us change us
2770.02,2772.21, to buy into the long hall
2775.75,2780.88, pull out of us to compare and not pull out of us the perfection pull out of us
2780.94,2783.01, all these fears
