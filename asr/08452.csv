110.64,116.91, but it's an amazing thing though the ship we had to deal with as we change as a man
117.36,120.39, people that knew us from that beginning phase
120.99,127.56, you know there's an impression made and that's the already know three years later after all that should happen and
127.65,131.07, this different band and i just felt like we had to
131.25,148.02, it fell like we had to change it because we were dealing with so much craft but we so packed kept her nose to the ground and kept the more mostly lustration in the project of the you know benefactresses

223.5,228.96, we think we need to do a really good at adapting to a situation we've always been really good at adapting and
229.71,233.16, so much time together as a band it seemed
233.19,237.12, absolutely pointless to drag somebody else into this to try and
