48.72,51.63, it would seem that everything in nature suggests
51.75,56.19, dependency one thing depending on another for survival itself
56.49,60.99, yes but what exactly is hawk food she asked again
62.1,64.02, you want to answer her
77.19,89.4, he 
89.46,95.88, on lake erromango the daily drama in nature does not always have a happy ending
95.88,108.18, in nature there is a victor and the seeming victim it is a dependency thing i mentioned earlier nor is nature always pleasant nature is what it is and what it has always been
108.54,125.07, mankind have learned from nature not from the mythical deity as to how we should act towards each other some of us insists that were better than animals and epidote codes of ethics though kind and gentle are not always in keeping with nature's laws
125.13,133.56, sami cruel entity that exploits the weak ignorant of the poor for example is either exalted or condemned
133.92,150.81, the exploiter is a business for example were all made to believe that such a creditor is to be admired after all business is business when it is a poor person victimizing another poor person to act itself is considered to be a crime

192.18,209.55, as adults we go into these human contracts knowing that were no longer truly free once we enter into such agreements and committed relationships we know that our time is no longer our own we know of the constant compromises and that monitoring is a part of that agreement
209.73,215.85, creative side as a human being takes a back seat to the mundane and to the unimportant
216.0,221.73, we become introverted since open and honest expressions are no longer permitted
221.73,236.91, older folks who are better at it will tell you in plain english it is better to hold your tongue and smile that to state your mind and argue we accept these facts as being self evident yet we need relationships
237.06,248.94, insects on the panels and is what we get out of the relationship that otway the price we pay don't you just wish you an mister these facts of life more clearly when you were younger
