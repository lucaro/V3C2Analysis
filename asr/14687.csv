32.64,43.8, jean christians in america and early on to avoid discussing religion with each other crossing boundaries concoction pain
44.31,51.42, been an integrated society were friendships and defiles make avoidance that poor option
51.78,63.63, f is a journey but crossing the divide i have a couple of friends of foster jewish and i find myself
65.16,87.93, scared of them but very hesitant very kind of i don't want to offend you if i say something cause i'm not quite sure what your religion is where is it i went up to one of my christian friends i could pretty much say anything and they did have an understanding of what they believe and what they what was accepted with them and
87.96,97.71, in with the jewish community i i myself very kind of like a gong be offended if i say this so i think 
99.66,104.58, i want to say that i try to keep my talk to him and i but at the same time i do
104.61,108.66, try not to put anything out there that could be very offensive
109.53,134.1, he teetered
134.97,146.52, oenothera sense my son
146.7,158.91, well i shall mention that i'm jewish he letting people know me as that the short de girl then i pay you no like
159.0,208.17, is that the short sugar yes oh yeah yeah she taught at school cause of that young you poor thing yea and everybody just like knows what's going on in my life based on the jewish holidays and stuff and there was a third greater that came up to me one day on the best and he told me that i was going to go into hell because i was jewish and i think that what the change my perspective on a lot of things because once you hear that from somebody you really don't care any more what people think about your religion because if that's all that they can tell you that you are going to help the matter what just because your jewish you really don't care about how others yoorgin because it just doesn't matter to you because that's their view that's your
210.36,224.22, if jews were not to take the pathway through jesus our understanding of scripture in particularly the new testament development of god's redemptive history would be that
224.61,232.89, they would not know god in the personal way so that they would not experience his his blessings eternally
233.37,261.03, i remember one time in science class there was a bunch of us sitting around and it came up that one of the boys in our group was jewish and people were just asking him you how do you feel as a jewish going to a catholic school how come we never knew you are jewish and the source of questions and he inveterate to discuss it he yoost embarrassed that people knew and i was surprised by that those prize that he'd been there for two three years and now he's kinsmanlike and they didn't know he was to wish
262.38,269.61, and this i i witnessed as a jew growing up next to a very very catholic community in cincinnati
269.67,278.61, when i told the other kids that i was playing with the catholic kids that i was too they said ah well you're going to help
279.63,283.14, and that's very common in
283.65,288.75, american life where jewish kid will come forward up to that point
288.75,290.25, has not revealed
290.79,301.62, he's coming from or where you know what she worships and how she professes religion and is told you going to hell you have no salvation
301.83,357.63, my friend was talking to me and we got into a discussion about religion and he got really upset because he wants like he strongly believes in christianity and everything that christianity is about but he doesn't want me to go to hell no i don't you know what i don't know what it's like to have about i don't know what we suppose to feel but i felt something that when i went in the water when i was elderslie was some sort of message from god that you know i shouldn't do this after came out of the water i didn't feel like a chinese may you
358.35,384.87, one of their threats all right in my country and the ignoble may make a lot of travel they make a table here in america to everywhere they are yes they were so bad in germany and to the economy in all monastic that's why were the noisette they said we're going to have a final solution to the assertion
385.23,390.15, to becoming the official legion of the roman empire in the fourth century a d
390.15,412.02, debated what to do with the jews who until then were viewed as siblings the common view was at the jews should be persecuted and killed the other view was at the jews be kept because the bareness to jesus but beheld as in fear for the blindness his views are profoundly expressed in mileage christian art
413.13,435.54, this time glass window from the tenth century a regular close on the left represented christianity rides serenity while being crowned by a divine hand on the ride synagog benton blindfolded representing judas with a crown fallen and a royal strand broken edified hanything her head
435.84,453.54, lingered in many churches in europe even to day
453.66,456.48, he
457.35,467.16, views were reflected in catholic services and helicon vatican council the next during holy way there is a prayer for the jews
467.28,475.95, after the second vatican council the prayer was changed and before the second bed of in council at this this was a series of prayers for the world
476.01,486.9, the passion and we prayed for the perfidious jews that their blindness might be taken away and that they might recognize salvation in jesus
487.08,496.65, new pairs very short says let us pray for the jewish people who were the first to hear the word of god and who had been given the covenant by god
496.89,504.09, then christian one of the things i carry with me as my heritage of martin luther
504.18,510.18, you may or may not know that luther himself spoke forcefully
510.27,512.43, against jews and judaism
513.3,517.02, adolf hitler even quoted martin luther
517.14,521.58, a number of times and speeches about jews and judaism
522.18,524.85, it's one of the unfortunate
525.6,533.52, parts of my spiritual heritage that martin luther took part in that debasing if you will
534.21,536.76, in the town church and wittenberg
538.47,549.0, there is on the town church where martin luther preached regularly in the jewish quarter of town there was a
549.54,560.07, statue facing the jewish quarter of a number of pigs meant to mock the jewish inhabitants of that section of town
561.12,569.85, if you know anything about jewish history especially about western european jewish history or even eastern european jewish history
569.88,576.54, there's just rivers of blood that had been shed that have been that have been caused by these charges
577.59,598.44, i know it's just creation christians or people in general feelun to ask jewish people about the holocausts because you want to ask them is it something you're still sensitive about it something that is still relevant and your life to day but you almost feel that by asking that question your discounting the experience as a whole you're saying oh it happened then not now it doesn't matter any more but it does matter
598.65,604.2, the holocaust and that the repression in wild harti is kind of
604.5,607.38, touch it leave alone
607.77,614.16, slowly and try to get on with your day it's just something that is always there
614.28,620.34, the elephant in the room when there's a jewish person that your communicating with
621.93,631.8, kind of you see them and then you see the concentration came to see the pictures you see in all the movies about world war two and all the
631.95,634.2, the destruction and
634.2,638.55, violence and everything just comes rushing back to you and your kind of like
639.81,642.75, have to stay away from this how can i do that
642.81,644.55, the commissary possible
645.57,659.16, it can be difficult to avoid one jewish feelings when reading the no testament particularly with reference to the parsees in the sanhedrin a showing his batsman
659.58,672.72, but is it today in the religion of the barricade father the death in the works of your father you will do you see that yestaday believe that jesus is not the christ
673.38,710.28, that the christ the messiah or christ severe beside they say that the crisis still coming in letters still coming for sotherton red who was alive but he adonises the christ he is antichrist that night the father and the son so entertainin he said there is a cry but it's not teased that's an anti prices and that's what detained too many christians take the bible in its plain sense and since its two thousand years old has his own literary genre if you take it in its plain sense you are missing it
710.7,712.95, a literal translation
713.04,716.04, sometimes miss reads
716.07,722.76, and that takes some sophistication that's why this is so difficult people who insist
722.85,726.06, plain reading of the tax and just gather
726.18,728.73, students together and they just bring
729.0,734.61, without any education and they just sit down and talk about the bible they are going to end
734.79,736.05, read it
736.11,793.44, literal sense i understand that there are many passages in the christian scriptures especially around the trial of jesus before the jewish and harassed be read by brothers and sisters in the jewish faith who would see that very condemnatory on the part of the church toward the jews as they read those passages but when we're at our best in the church and missus methought history not always out of our best but we were at our best interpreting the text we see the whole of the jewish scriptures as well as the new testament being the story of all of us and so when the priest and the sandstone
793.68,806.55, danger is that an unenlightened reading of the text a fundamentalist reading of the text of the plane reading of the text takes this as a description of all jews including jews to day then it becomes very destructive
807.15,813.21, jews represent in authentic religion in christians represent authentic religion
813.39,818.67, i think an enlightened reading of the text as we've got profits warning their own people
818.91,831.84, and we have to take as warnings to us too and we have to be careful if we don't understand what's going on then we use that text stereotype ologies including jews to day
832.32,835.83, and that leads to hatred and war and tragedy
836.25,857.01, what's happened the christ culchard assented on jesus trial were allegedly the jews coloring in a tourist matter he set of jesus with the condemned to death the passion of the christ film follows a long tradition of portraying the jews as each to get us and the romans are separated by standers
858.48,864.75, witenagemote
866.34,870.84, the misshapen
871.62,890.43, i aeternitate people who did the kinds of killing
891.48,893.55, jesus was subjected
893.58,904.8, then clearly and oh by the way we find out that ponchos pilot was called back to rome because of his cruelty and here is a guy who in terms of an exonerating new testament
905.76,908.19, and exonerating new testament
908.43,911.58, needed to separate itself from judaism
911.61,920.64, that made the statement it was the josaphat better way to separate yourself from a people than to blame them for the death of what you hold most precious
921.33,928.74, tis my belief in my understanding of the scriptures that the jews did not kill christ
929.16,930.84, that in essence
931.26,937.26, of humanity by our sinfulness and short coming nail jesus to the cross
938.22,942.24, and gentiles all of us included in that
942.63,946.86, we nailed him to the tree there at
948.18,951.09, city limits of jerusalem that day
951.21,954.9, to place the blame on jews
955.56,960.75, more than to place blame on oneself is clearly wrong
960.93,972.78, i don't think it makes a difference really killed him like i could have been any one like of any religion endymion then two days and oriskany i really don't feel 
973.32,977.64, even worth blaming anybody for it because really
977.76,982.29, would make a difference because it happens that a long time ago
982.65,990.45, and i feel that it did happen a very long time ago and you can't place blame on people to day for something that happened 
994.35,999.15, i think that there are you know that historically
999.75,1002.15, probably 
1002.51,1004.07, more
1005.42,1009.41, context of not saying what we needed to say
1009.8,1023.0, let people with the impression that some hardly the jews were responsible for the death of christ i don't personally believe that fact is the romans are the ones who actually put christ to death
1023.27,1025.01, the problem is 
1025.07,1033.14, the retroactive blame on an entire people as if it were a theological necessity
1033.32,1035.36, blame the jewish people
1035.81,1039.8, the death of jesus and therefore justify
1040.49,1048.35, kind of persecution and oppression that christians levied against jews particularly in europe
1048.8,1049.82, for
1050.24,1051.98, over years
1052.37,1069.2, make any sense the notion that the persecution of the jews is their own fault is still surprisingly wildly held so god pablo rebelled at the learned the hard way that that's not really the best way to do it
1069.23,1077.54, but it all started with the synagogue of satan it all started with that deception inside god church and look where it led them
1078.02,1085.55, look at the pain and the suffering that they had done or because they wouldn't believe god they wouldn't let him lead them
1085.67,1095.06, the idea that the jewish clamourer it before god was passed over to the christians as we central to the christianity
1096.38,1105.2, and that is a notion that the church took the place of the jewish people in the favour of god and that the christians than were the ones that
1105.23,1136.88, nearly followed god's will and because the jews rejected jesus as god one son the incarnation of god which is at the very center of our story as christians that somehow the church then took a superior position over the people of israel there are a lot of us in the christian community that don't buy that but it's been very restrained throughout the centuries
1137.3,1139.97, we don't call our scriptures the old testament
1140.39,1150.23, always know somebody who is ignorant of his duty is if he starts talking about the bible as being the old testament but the point is our bible we know is the tenor the hypercrit ures
1151.31,1158.48, it is only when you have a new covenant and then you speak in terms of the old covenant that you're talking about supercession
1158.78,1162.05, our covenant has taken the place of
1162.83,1170.39, which was agreed between god and israel or god in thee is relates or god in the jewish people
1171.02,1183.62, well that's why i say the supersession is m is a more difficult thing to deal with than just the bad characterization of fairies because christians have these claims that there is no salvation
1183.65,1185.33, of jesus
1185.6,1191.45, if you have that plane then you have to sort look at your own religion as the only true religion
1191.75,1195.44, really catholic doctrine but catholic sectanus about that
1195.53,1199.85, i believe that christianity superseded judaism
1200.84,1214.19, word i would choose would be complete it brings it to its fullness while the second vatican council removed some of the most overreaching aspects of food guerrita divide
1214.4,1216.23, progressed
1216.8,1218.99, flopsie
1219.02,1220.73, how can it be achieved
1221.3,1245.33, i mean think that i'm lost because i don't accept these crises my say you think on your inferior beyond is your head you think we want weymouth you have a true don't think you're in for woodworth that i do not say that i and i not by logical means intense i was all confused myself but sustained
1246.02,1251.42, i think what we are going through in modern times is the experience of pluralism
1251.54,1257.45, and paris were we always had differences but it was easy to do with the differences because the other people were just wrong
1258.02,1261.23, have to worry about it but now many of us are married
1261.53,1278.48, others and were working with those others and we have come to respect and love them and so we can't just say their rombeau there other so poor is is a huge change i feel that one of the ways that we can
1279.71,1302.39, they work with a situation where there are different theological views of another religion is to come together like we have today and have no respectful discussions where we bring up the issues bring up the theatre don't know about and just i'm not sure how to say this but offending you so i'm whereas you respectfully and you you know and respond he respectfully and i think that one of the best ways
1302.45,1303.53, to
1303.86,1312.47, as to ask questions and just be open to any direction of discussion may take i believe that there can be a dialogue
1312.59,1319.04, in a situation where say for example an evangelical group
1319.31,1321.08, believes firmly
1321.2,1323.3, that the only
1323.69,1327.11, and life is to be saved
1327.23,1328.82, acceptance of jesus
1329.42,1337.55, a bell and in another group like the jewish community that has absolutely nothing to do with that theology and will not
1337.55,1341.39, there be a dialogue and that time absolutely
1341.66,1342.86, why not
1342.89,1346.7, about it don't be afraid of somebody telling you
1346.7,1358.16, i understand what you're saying and i don't accept it and here's why and here's how we believe here's the information that were sharing absolutely there can be dialogue
1358.31,1359.39, however
1359.39,1362.18, it takes courage
1362.3,1367.16, come to dialogue for the sake of sharing information and primarily for the sake of
1367.19,1369.23, building trust
1369.44,1373.43, i think it's important that i learned that some
1373.52,1377.3, people feel weary about talking
1377.69,1409.97, to people because they afraid of offending them and i never really thought about that but once you have it out there then it's there and it's a lot easier to talk about it and once you've cross that boundary it so much easier to so it's so much more interesting because you really get all these different perspectives from people because i have talked to people like this and it's so interesting to hear how they use differentiation
1410.21,1411.41, a
1412.13,1422.81, i think the greatest fear that people have with regard to that is that some or other when we affirm someone else's religious tradition that we're going to lose our own
1422.87,1460.49, and the fact is that i have found personally that in talking with others about their faith and coming to some understanding of that which we share in common i have become even clearer about what it is i believe in what i hold to and so rather than it being a detractor from my own faith expression of my own understanding it has become an affirmation i do of course in judiciary and everything
1460.61,1462.59, some of our services
1463.01,1468.62, nice to invite her by to attend the holy week services for a week and then give a course on what he heard
1468.86,1491.72, i think that is interesting because talking to people like us even the discussion it here it's all me like think about my religion and think about life how like my beliefs and like how i can further like show people be not in like a pushbutton people like through love and kindness like what cachibou and then cried like take
1491.99,1497.96, lions and kind of incertam with mine and sea like how i can grow as a person
1498.35,1506.75, one this conversation only i really like how i got to talk to christians about the religion of judaism intrepidity
1506.75,1523.22, i like a bicycle religion ever comes up and this was really was really interesting that i got to talk and like the prospect of of the holocaust and how josenhans can get along together
1525.08,1527.09, the course of minutes
1527.21,1532.37, group of the fat youth much along a path that feel the peers have
1532.94,1535.76, can i comfort an awkwardness
1535.79,1539.12, by long history and misconceptions
1539.69,1552.68, in times of unprecedented desire to heal all wounds the experience of this youth demonstrates that opening monipodio can ashure new page in the jewish christian narrative
1572.09,1582.44, he 
1593.06,1593.78, he
1597.47,1598.97, he
