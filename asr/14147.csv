0.87,163.05, and now the wide contacted me and i fell out with the christmas the charity malformed years they wanted to get some kind of a new project going similar to the panopolitan in sanatoriums and i was doing a firstrate time and so we had once i got finished with that we went ahead and in largentiere have always loved them go and when i saw them when i realized tartarin it landed still self to mose and i like the colors and i like the the flowing of the work and it's got some pretty vivid colour in it which i am pretty happy then mediation painting i have my soul pays what we did to work together because we wanted the bear to look uniform and not like one i see beside one time james stole we both sketched or design on the bear and inhibition and she did what we call middle ground and that would be the timid value range and then i would go back in and i did highlights and are shadows and in a marble when i came home from our trip we've been gone for eight days that she painted in a first thing i got out of the car even though i would cadwal
163.08,168.39, so they came northeastward the front door
168.63,177.78, the nordenskiold and in really placed with it bring the sculptor melmoth i didn't want to just be involved with a
178.23,202.26, paying job now that that can be great but you know i felt like if i were to be involved i wanted t do something physically to the bear so saw seized on upon this idea where we could you know after the bears formed and toutou a cavity if you will dogmatic cavity cut through the mid section of the bar into which we can
202.38,235.92, glass that in a kind of incasing but respecting the form of the bear but have this beautiful skill model air stream kind of in it in the bears got i use the dark new to push it back and forth if i make a mistake acetarai i make a mistake but the dark will allow me to push it back and forth kindheit and then subtracted
236.01,253.26, the more i thought about it i said here it was i brought the bear i said and i looked at her looked at the note sinister depaint my head and that's the most difficult part to come out with the idea when she had the idea ithamar of executing it was overwhelming for awhile and
253.29,266.85, i wasn't really the bear that was overwhelming it was just knowing i was going to have to learn a new skill and thinking that i would probably be all right but still not real sure of it
266.91,281.01, and and then how big it was i knew it was going to be life size but still when it ended up in my grate actual sketches on the beer were bare then what i had sketched on paper which is fine as we wanted that
282.39,317.76, that you get so where we placed this and also more thinking about dress or dressing the bar barely press for dinner so were thinking pants down here so that's why we have designed here connected with the gold once again to signify the economic value to the valley and as it flows through here this what we're thinking of were thinking of dressing the bear and so some of the major the bigger designs will go on the bigger areas of the bear the fierce the sermon
318.09,320.31, given up its energy
322.08,330.96, transferring that to the bar of the barkentine so that's what i want to try to incorporate into my design
330.99,334.29, the energy will come to flow from the fish
334.68,347.25, the bear this way all the way back and then in lantine design of a hard line coming right to the middle of her of this mid section even this
348.33,362.34, glass the scenery itself everything is energy and that's a native american that's a pickle on bindle that all we are his flowing energy and the universe
362.34,391.14, in this case it's perfect because the first has the energy and as it's going to flow from the fish to give life to the bar once i got started applying the glass it it seemed to take on a life of its own and when i when i work close to it i have to back away because i don't get a good view habitual i back away and when i back away onusual pretty happy it slogan
391.56,398.01, pretty happy with it for it's going to the it's going to take a long time but 
398.22,416.4, it's exciting to keep working on it i don't dread working on and i look forward to the coming out and getting everything done so come out or its abeaut of having different before going to god every one will have a different idea and as it will be great to
417.03,440.7, see the bear displayed together that would be negotiated her asonante what happens i want to still be france wotan so we had we had a great time in dolores one that i do think this beateth man projects are reasons
440.88,590.46, this has been so beneficial as that we do get to pay together and you know you and though it's a time consuming project i think a man beninobenone for our being able to come over here and paint his beautiful room with caribbean these hallowell to be a part of the fantastic organization of one they have or we can to support their mission and you know meisterstuecke
