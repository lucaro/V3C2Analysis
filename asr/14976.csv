18.63,29.19, tempestuous warranted in aesthetics
30.84,39.48, i ototachibana heresies
40.56,45.48, sidenote
46.14,55.71, the towerman pensioners yet i
55.83,58.23, of the 
58.56,60.75, federal legislation
61.08,69.09, so that whole area is protected on the federal legislation so that you can't actually build
69.33,77.52, introduce any new significant radio transmitters into that area so it's what's called a radio quiet one
77.58,79.26, protected in such
79.5,81.78, that's
82.44,87.45, so that is that's exactly the
87.48,91.56, the areas before people will spend a billion dollar building something
91.59,113.49, write stronomy that has to be legislative protection for that for the area so both western italia has that in south africa sight has that as well so that there exists not as a hundred people there now they have homesteads and there are public roads so there is interference but
113.73,136.71, where i will to define buffer buffins around various bits of infrastructure so for example ten clemente side of a road you couldn't build her an antenna so you can you can build the antennas far enough away that did the interference drops off so we produce a mask of the area that has goannas and with bill the telescopes in them in the gilsons
137.43,140.88, to say of sidenote microphone
141.03,151.35, that confers president 
151.92,166.08, close celestialism don't mind
167.4,169.68, he pointed them with
169.68,181.41, and somewhat semisoft
184.14,187.17, roared
188.58,192.51, well that's the card they've chosen to play
193.89,198.0, i do that is because it has a fair chance of working
198.78,200.94, so
201.18,204.9, so in australia were very strongly focused on
205.5,207.39, the best possible instrument
207.39,209.22, the best possible side
209.58,213.63, and evaluation process under way
213.75,218.07, and which have so it comes out technically and scientifically
218.07,227.64, best place to build the scar is where it should be built sorry
228.93,232.44, wapentake
235.59,238.59, have to be honest and say it's difficult to say
239.31,243.06, there are many factors that are being evaluated
244.74,249.03, it doesn't matter how many technical and scientific factors that you
249.06,252.96, sometimes subjective factors 
253.02,256.14, coming to account as well but
256.77,259.62, i think it will be a big consideration
259.77,263.16, spending a billion dollars they're usually pretty rational
264.75,269.82, we desire that god questions so 
270.15,271.86, the end of this year
272.07,278.97, an international organization comes into existence called the cargrim office and
279.24,286.77, to spend a million heroes for the design process those nightly milliners come from
286.98,289.32, stand at the moment by countries
289.86,298.23, and because countries will then have two delegates on the governing board of that organization those delegates will decide
298.32,315.15, that's going to be that's going to be the ultimate selection committee there'll be a number of recommendations through the valuation prices but those documents end up with that governing board they've paid the money
315.36,327.87, the pipe for the right to make that decision it's their money on the line 
331.2,339.27, and if you had been concentrated 
339.9,344.01, yeah according to my understanding of of all this and
344.13,348.21, stress again or not an expert cosmologists but
348.84,350.1, yes that
351.51,352.8, as
354.54,358.83, that's about as much as i can say that appears to be the case that
358.95,361.56, is constantly created
362.04,364.95, the vacuum so this is the problem
365.04,370.98, physics has always told us that these things always as ourson gone
371.22,372.18, so
373.89,375.39, it's different
375.6,377.1, then we need to
377.28,378.45, explain that
378.48,380.64, revised
380.67,383.79, physical laws so it is a bizarre
384.15,387.99, scenario if you're used to physics
389.22,391.83, no special relativity was bazar
392.01,393.87, mechanics as bizarre
393.87,396.48, just the next bit of barristers
398.46,419.07, he said that he associates savonarola but the anatomist of the valuation process
419.19,422.85, so very important part of that process
422.88,427.47, to test the ornament so they built
427.8,442.92, strato go and measure that and that was deployed in australia for a number of months to make measurements that exactly the same equipment was deployed in south africa of the same number of months so all of the data exists
442.95,446.49, i haven't seen it i've seen little bits of it
446.85,455.91, yes that i will be evaluated any differences in the interference will be 
456.75,457.92, discovered
458.34,460.65, that will be taken into account when
460.68,463.32, this group of people make their decision
463.47,478.77, one very strong factor americanisation that fermentation motion
478.92,496.11, she had aye really really good question so self generated interference from the instruments i can often be
496.11,504.6, the worst offender so so you need to set it a stringent specifications on
504.63,521.37, what inference that you are allowed to self generate so i can't real of the name of the relevant spectator that no speck whatever it's a military specification it very very stringent and
521.49,535.26, anything that goes up to be installed on the side needs to be tested in a lab and proven to have emissions lower than the mill penumbra that actually a very very
535.65,541.68, thing to do and takes a lot of time to appropriately
541.83,543.09, she
543.36,555.45, equipment so for example some of the equipment were sending up for the motion white field array is just a doing its final stages of testing in the lead and
555.78,576.0, you have to pay a lot of very careful attention to make sure that you don't as spoil the sight to spy been you it toothache
576.09,580.65, marian on dis
581.1,583.65, worth
584.16,588.21, elihu
588.39,591.93, late
595.08,597.42, just bite
601.71,604.89, he formally valuation follows
604.89,606.18, i
606.24,608.67, technical parameters
608.7,613.53, i political primaners so those sorts of things affected in
614.73,620.7, the valuation will consider all sorts of things the cost of library in the two countries
620.91,625.17, the availability of skilled work force
625.17,626.52, security
626.73,632.97, the sort of things will be effected into the decision all of there's about five pages of
633.18,641.46, and in fact he has a tame white assigned to it so yes that the short answers yes that that all of these things will be looked at
643.17,650.25, after right the roses moralist hereditary where are we not
652.05,656.1, she saw me
656.58,662.94, stray has traditionally followed what's called the open skies policy which is
662.97,667.26, regardless of whose pipe for the instrument the resultant died a
667.32,676.5, access to the instrument is open to absolutely anyone so regardless of who pays for it typically explain the case that
676.56,693.57, in return is for people to do the best science regardless of wellhead for it or not and so is a sort of reciprocal thing amongst the countries in the world that no wise facilities in the us for free us people use facilities in australia for three
693.66,698.16, that paradigm has shifted a little bit in recent years
698.19,700.8, and i think it's fully decided
700.8,711.18, for the but i suspect that given the countries and many of the individuals involved it would not be a very strong push to keep their open skies policy
715.35,728.58, the roads over worcestershire yet but a really good question and the short answers yes
730.74,738.84, one of the things that i've been involved in his desiring thee a remote station configuration and
738.9,749.19, definitely the catharines configuration has advantages over in north south configuration and that's because if you make an observation over a number of hours
749.28,751.02, rotation of the earth
751.11,760.83, you a better result for an east west or raven and arcot it's a it's a pretty technical consideration but it is true that
761.19,762.54, west is better
763.32,773.25, the anaesthesia
776.85,781.65, pioneers
782.1,784.38, santa
785.64,788.85, yeah there's
789.3,791.94, number of different ways that you
792.09,796.23, can deal with in the fence so of course the best
796.5,801.18, best way is not to produce any interference at all
801.99,845.13, when the diners being processed whether the signals are deterministic or not there are certain signal processing techniques that you can use to remove the interference from the data as long as the interference is not so strong that overloads the eternal frontin components of thee at the telescope like the amplifiers soon as you drive the system not many there's nothing you can do if the instruments working with within it sort of windham range then there's a lot of things you can do in the signal protesting afterwards so first thing is minimized the inference of generate second thing is
845.16,865.35, to place the signal processing algorithms that allow you to remove the interference from the data before you make an image men
865.53,867.36, i
867.57,871.68, the lantern
873.12,877.77, yet so that also a good question
877.77,881.7, so the dishes can point in any direction
881.79,883.32, the dishes
883.38,887.61, to within about ten degrees elevation
887.61,889.98, can montmorenci
890.01,893.31, the sky the
893.94,897.96, eurie that sit on the ground and anon steerable
898.2,900.63, suffer from a projection effect
900.75,903.09, if your object is that death
903.09,906.72, full sensitivity and
906.72,911.43, you looking at objects closer and closer to the raisin your flat
911.43,914.25, at present you know you getting a full collecting area
914.58,925.2, degrees or getting the projected part of that area and horizon you getting nothing so he sensitivity varies as a function of
925.41,937.11, of the object that you're looking at but it varies predictably and you can always design sequences of observations that keep you close to the zenith
937.23,960.12, my entire full sensitivity asafoetida estates in senates yeah it'll be saved let say you'll say to about plastery declination
960.24,963.06, some sensitivity so that's
963.75,964.98, so
965.91,967.74, yet
967.74,973.56, the really important thing about being in the southern hemisphere is that the centre of the
973.59,975.66, he passes
975.66,980.97, so initially there were four sights considered china
981.36,983.58, brazil argentina
983.91,985.23, africa
985.41,986.7, a
986.7,993.72, and a big point in favor of south africa and australia is that there a latitude around about monastery
993.78,998.22, the galaxy goes straight overhead so obviously
998.22,1001.37, biggest telescope in the world should be able to say our galaxy
1001.61,1003.56, these is not much good
1005.27,1011.18, pretty technical questions
1012.74,1018.59, now arranged
1018.74,1023.33, ah yes well
1024.23,1030.14, some of these cosmology experiments it doesn't matter conservare direction you look
1031.37,1033.71, universe
1034.22,1044.93, probably the very very first observations will be looking at some part of the sky that's very well known so we can first of all make sure that we're getting the right answer out
1044.99,1046.34, and
1047.24,1049.82, gone through that except one is
1051.77,1073.46, the telescope will be scheduled to do lots of different things and can possibly do many different experiments in all thine so you might be searching for pallas at the same time that you mapping the hydrogen in the galaxy and the same time that your doing cosmological observations for dark energy so one of the really nice things about
1073.61,1078.05, the instrument is that you can probably simultaneously run
1078.08,1079.94, what different experiments
1080.39,1081.32, he
1082.7,1090.11, there it make it a shame he who not
