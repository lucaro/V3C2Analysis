3.09,13.11, and we told scripture to be prepared to give a ready defense for the hole that we have in christ jesus but many of us christians
13.56,16.74, no idea why we believe what we believe
17.07,21.63, i watched the special broadcast for monday february 
21.63,37.44, i'm derek gilbert in studio a paris special guest we met in a very well alister was part of this we were at the rancour for the grand opening last year maybe you remember that program and encountered this couple who are connected to a ministry
37.47,39.78, just spoken to the president of
40.11,65.25, like a week before because james walker the president of watchmen fellowship had just attended that president to be donald trump's summit with evangelical leaders so on behold we encounter a couple who played interparliamentary at the grand opening of the argan counter they've just authored a book and it is a topic that compared to much of what we do it by watch t wouldn't be considered
65.52,67.17, he used the word
68.28,69.42, at
69.48,75.12, you pretending to be aliens from outer space
75.39,80.28, i say that i cheated because i love those topics but at the end of the day
80.43,87.12, we do here it's guy watched t v and what we do in our everyday walk as christians has to be about christ and him crucified
87.93,103.47, and so we need to be prepared to give a reason for the hope that we have in christ and that's what this book is all about by which we are saved is the title of the book the author's are with me today kelly and pressed on congreve to scotch the tank cancut be ruth you there 
103.95,110.49, this is where the river meets the road we are called as christians to carry out the great commission
110.52,129.48, to make disciples of all nations to spread the gospel to the end of the earth not all of us are called to go serve in foreign fields to go to africa to go to the aboriginal
129.54,133.74, life as we know what we so different from what we are accustomed to hear in our
133.92,135.81, in the western world
136.2,142.59, for me roughing it is having to stay you know motel at or something
143.28,147.99, but we are called to be prepared whenever the opportunity presents it
148.2,150.15, the gospel
150.93,158.67, what inspired the writing of by which we are saved and what is your hope what was your goal in writing the book kelly
158.82,161.22, well
161.31,165.6, works in ministry and we find that
166.11,169.35, very often when he speaks with people they
170.22,173.94, say they believe in jesus but they're not able to articulate
173.94,188.28, clear gospel message they feel intimidated about sharing it they're not sure exactly what to say what versus to use and they're afraid they're going to be asked questions that they can't answer so they don't feel comfortable sharing the gospel and they
188.43,204.99, so fred and politically correct culture to offend people and we want christians to feel completely equipped to share the gospel a prosecutor watchman fellowship watchman dorg which is an apologetic ministry
206.19,211.83, why did you take the approach that you took with the book i mean and how would you describe
211.98,224.91, book by which we are saved we really want to give a clear precise presentation of the gospel first of all and then have a tool for people to have in their hands
224.91,227.67, answer common questions about the gospel
227.7,234.99, now watchman we answer specific questions from colton religions will this is specifically aimed at
235.2,240.54, it's a book for helps for personal advantages we want to help the believer
240.57,252.63, answer specific questions about the gospel of the lord jesus christ which we of course will be discussed in the first grandisonian so our heart for evangeline
252.78,260.43, for that and there now you know as well as we do we live in a politically correct society and talking about
260.73,270.3, matters of faith and politics are not real socially acceptable and so we want to help
271.11,278.25, talk about things a faith in the context of policy correct culture so we also want to present
278.49,281.04, helpful ways to
281.1,294.72, the conversation in a helpful way in other words a sort of a practical guide show to show the gospel yes and i think something too for pastors at something to pick up and each
294.96,360.63, the church folks or send a school teacher can pick it up and the way it's formatted and picked up and use it in a small group okay go right the verses are right in there we put them in their specifically for that you can pierrefitte across these things and you have i'm sure share in your faith too and so we want to put something combined altogether here that are some of the most common things that people are bennecourt as they try to witness because witnessing dosing like a real daunting thing to most lyonnaise politically corrected so we want a helpful guide for that mebbe
360.84,364.8, first corinthians and the first eight verses of that chapter instead of
365.31,372.09, john remotely what was the reason behind it why did you choose first corinthians 
372.36,424.95, open the book well it started probably twenty years ago when i first got saved and my sister got saved and we were looking for gospel tracks to share with other people and when we got saved we were taught first crittenden on through eight is the contain agasp specifically versus three and four but we couldn't find any gospel tracts that had those verses in them they had lots of great verses about salvation like john three sixteen which is what the father did or effigies to at nine which is that it's the method grace through faith but the actual gospel presentation that paul says this is the message of by which you are saved was not in the gospel tracks so it was something that i had always wanted to do was to have a better gospel tract and
424.95,434.07, eventually turned into our desire to write a book about it first indians is one of the most amazing chapters in the entire neat estimate not only does it
434.37,441.96, out the gospel very clearly and the elements of the gospel later that chapter he also gives them very specific details
442.41,451.41, all the members of the church of corinth that they wanted you to go back to jerusalem and ask around confirm what palisade was historically true and accurate and not just
451.65,457.05, making stuff up on a fair what are the basic elements of the gospel then
457.08,511.14, well we go back through the gospel mentioned there in first reinstate gospel by which we are saved i want to emphasize that again very important it says by which we are saying we know it gospel means it's good in some good news it's a message okay by which we are said that seems to get get skifting and then he goes on and tells us and versus though for what that specific saving message is that jesus died for our sins according to the scriptures was buried and on third day he rose from the dead according to the scriptures to those elements are right their jesus will that that that too who he is and specifically the jesus of the bible you know paul warns of other jesus so were specific to talk about who jesus is so we have jesus died for our sins well that's what he did
511.44,545.7, who and what he did he died for our sins which also talks about why he died when he died for our sins were sinners and need of a saviour so jesus died for our sins was buried on the third day he rose from the bed so you have what he did who who he is what he did why we need it and then how do we get that well it's by faith and then importantly also is something he mentions twice in those verses that i think gets overlooked a lot too that according to the scriptures is mentioned twice
545.7,547.65, do we find that well
547.8,569.1, we find the saving message the gospel message in the bible in the scriptures it's according to the scripture so those are the elements right there and that those short passages herberstein on through a whole what why would that be more effective or preferable method or
569.16,576.75, if i can use the word better verses in order to explain the gospel to somebody then john three sixteen for god so loved the world that he gave
576.93,582.57, only begun on what are the differences there and why are they important
583.32,602.31, john three sixteen is very important and is averse everybody loves and so many people know i mean people that have very very little religious training often no john three she certainly aren't diminishing down three it just doesn't have the cross in it and
602.58,631.32, perhaps of someone as presenting the gospel using john three they would not to mention the cross but if they didn't they would be missing that element of the cross so if you use first corinthians through for nothing is missing it says this is the message by which you are safe so you know the whole messages there the other thing that helps is that nothing else is there so if someone thought there was something else to salvation
631.53,640.59, paul says this is the message by which this is a good news by which you are saved and so there's nothing additional there which
640.65,649.2, should teach someone that it's his grace through faith and nothing added why do we nature
649.38,664.29, have such a reluctance to share a you mentioned political correctness out there but even before political correctness was saying i remember in my early days as even years ago when the climate wasn't nearly as toxic as it is to day
664.83,667.05, early in my walk
667.2,672.69, after the lord applied spiritual two by four inside of my 
672.9,678.66, i was still very reluctant because of the fear is that i didn't know enough
679.29,708.06, order to make the case what is that a big part of her there were other objections that christians in the church have to sharing the gospel with others and that's something we've talked about each billeting that reluctance fear certainly i would think nathan
708.06,710.58, so you don't have to be
710.85,745.83, a scholar you know have to know everything the verses are right there for each question in just give the reference to verses actually stated it which i find very helpful i can tell that to some one at this hypallage of scripture in my books that i the end of the book and then look back three texts open at the same because if you're in a conversation with someone you don't know the answer you know what it's okasaki not sure
745.92,770.67, that you don't need to be a degree scholar exactly in this material in order to share exactly okay and then another with fear i think related which we've talked about and maybe they're afraid of is the person going to get mad at a well that the approach suggest is asking questions you know so because if he enter into the conversation with their permission
771.42,773.4, what to be afraid of the
773.4,794.55, and yet let me ask you about that it was something i picked up on whetstones because of the schedule we've had the last week or two i've not read all the way through but i was standing through and picking up his hat i thought were really intriguing why in the book by which we are saved do you ask or do you do you make the case that asking is better than telling
794.76,810.33, well the doc is a message so our tendency is to tell we want to tell the gospel run a share it but when you purpose to share information with some one you have to
810.54,820.05, you going to corner them are you going to try to pin them down and get them to give you what the response you want they might not even be interested in talking about it they might
820.38,821.19, not
821.22,839.94, all comfortable talking about faith you know they might be afraid of the politically correct thing but if you ask somebody if you ask her permission are you interested in talking about this topic then they've agreed to talk about it already and
840.36,862.2, not me pressing you into a conversation that you're not comfortable with i'm going to ask your permission we've been neighbors for years and i've never asked you if you're a christian or if you what you believe about the bible or about god and that can strike a conversation out that point they can say you know i don't like to talk about religion and now you know where they stand
862.38,890.19, they also know that your someone that is interested and maybe at that point when they do want to talk to someone about matters of faith may be they're sick or someone in their family died you have let them know that you are interested in that topic you're someone they can go to but you are not the person that cornered them and tried to press them into agreement with a message she
890.19,932.85, yes my training and sales said you know never tell always ask questions because you can develop a conversation unless you're asking right and that's the thing we need to look at it that way it's a conversation an ongoing conversation is not a formula it's not a system it's nothing like that these are real people were having a real conversation without real issue here sangershausen
932.91,938.13, and you know that takes some back and forth conversation
938.19,963.03, in the right attitude you know of the singeing the right attitude in a right spirit in that conversation so i guess in a short while the sound does sinsible ascertain what who they are what they believe right on each of the issues and one of the things i found in this was drilled into me 
963.3,973.59, broadcasting stops along the way in my career i don't ask yes or no questions except maybe for the earnest question about would you mind if we had this conversation
973.89,991.98, if you want to generate a conversation we have to ask questions and steers will notice it when i rarely ask or no questions of guests and that's why i get more information when you know asked
991.98,1004.37, so helpful to know how much they already know and what they already believe because we are bringing up this topic because we care about their eternal destiny and because we care we want to know
1004.4,1022.46, the interested if they want to hear more if they're not ready if they already know something but maybe they don't know the whole gospel and where do we need to fill in the holes of their understandings salaciously witnessing but people are
1022.73,1025.16, to accepting
1025.7,1034.16, in trusting somebody who who may not be as knowledgeable as someone else and i found this in my sales to war to be true i might not have been the most expert
1034.91,1046.31, salesmen when it came to how to fabricate steel but my customers knew that i cared about doing a really good job for them and i think that in the same way people understand that
1046.37,1052.76, them from a sincere desire and the two head because you genuinely care about them
1052.91,1078.83, need to be a professor of ancient hebrew or greek usage to share the gospel and get them to trust you and as you said it's okay to say i'm not sure but let me find out and i'll get back to you and that's why we tried to make this a complete handbook that it's something you could literally keep in your purse keep in your glove box in the car keenest if you have a chance to talk
1079.04,1127.7, someone about the gospel and they said well i don't believe god is a trinity you can just turn right to that objection and there are ten verses on the trinity that you can say well here's what the bible says you may not believe it you may not agree but i just want to share with you what the bible says that way it's not me as the expert trying to press you into agreement but i'm just showing you a god says and then it's only spirits job to convince that person that this is the truth and that they need it certain that we're going to have an extended version of this conversation
1128.3,1131.99, a person's reaction to or or there
1132.59,1134.69, understanding of the bible as the
1134.96,1137.09, of god effect
1137.21,1147.32, ability to witness i guess and this relates to what we see in the culture around us we've rejected the authority of the bible and so people feel that they're free to do
1147.32,1149.45, feels right
1150.32,1151.64, how do we
1152.06,1169.85, deal with that where people say well yeah bible says that but how do i know that that's true well that's a good question ascertaining their view of the bible i think is and we talk about this in the book is a good starting place because
1170.12,1171.29, in the bible
1171.5,1179.81, first ronsin the bible were asking them to believe that saving message and so if there already
1179.87,1186.26, don't believe the bible then does that mean they're not open well that some need to ascertain
1186.32,1196.07, the anti bible will then not have very conversation with them is it a sincere question about the bible well you know what i can do i can suggest and ask him
1196.31,1200.99, be interested in reading a resource that i considered to
1201.08,1208.94, really explain our position as believers on why we believe the bible and if they have a sincere question they'd probably be open to that right
1208.94,1223.91, it's a good starting place plus if they just openly reject the bible right it tells me too you know that's probably not a believer here that i'm talking to and so if they have a general respect for the bible
1224.0,1305.75, we know that up front than we know okay we can probably have a good fruitful conversation and go into more these issues so it gave book then you address that and then the sea based on their response here are the potential ways you can approach the situation and the bessacre are so many different definitions to day of what a christian is you could be affiliated with a church that's a colt but they call themselves christian so sometimes asking a question like are you a christian is not going to give you the information as to whether the person really is born again but if you ask em if they what they believe about the bible and they said well i think i think it's god's word great what even that can lead into another question what do you think about jesus and other topics and that's why we make an issue of according the scriptures being in the gospel twice that it's hard to trust a message i would maybe think it's almost impossible to trust some message from an unreliable source but if they you know if we're saying this message is according the scriptures that the source is as god's word that's a great place to start talking about the gospels because you raise a good point and you made a
1305.81,1310.79, the comment earlier and used the words other jesus is
1311.72,1312.98, how
1313.16,1315.56, important is it to understand
1315.59,1317.6, when somebody uses that name
1317.66,1359.63, they mean getting him to define that term and how do we know when we're talking about the same jesus well and that some more going to find out in the conversation as going to question what do they believe about jesus and this is you know this is assuming this is an ongoing conversation where you know the atmosphere is comfortable in it you know they're willing to answer these questions yearnings were presenting jesus who is fully manfully god he's a jesus of the bible he did physically on the cross he was physically buried on the third day he physically rose from the dead he is who he says he is he's the one way of salvation
1359.63,1401.9, the old testament prophets side my sithes things are the god the son the second person of the trinity the all these things this is who were talking about and this is who we want to be sure they understand where presenting to them as the jesus presented in the gospel for sprinting by asking
1401.93,1423.62, except that there are other pets because jesus did not allow for that in his own words that's right but again it comes back to their understanding and acceptance of the bible as true an authoritative word of god that's where i went also reminds me that the bud can be used before the factor after the fact because if the conversation happens and then they ask you a question
1423.92,1465.29, it's in the book you can use a book to answer the question but you can also read the book in advance and it'll bring to mind things taste them like i never thought about asking them what do they think about jesus the man is he god but the book will bring to mind things to ask the probably other guys like me who assumed that people can hear what's in their heads and sharon is hominem that that's not true i still make that mistake from time to time and assume that i'm speaking the same terminology when that's not necessarily the case and is important because if they have a different understanding as paul wrote if anyone comes presenting a different gospel even an angel of light 
1465.41,1474.92, then be accursed and the book is by which we are saved kellyan present and are the authors where do people find a copy of the book
1475.88,1477.08, sufficient
1477.17,1479.81, for publishing co

1526.67,1547.7, everybody can see where it is is not like we're hiding its that's kind of the joke of younger which is better there will be an audio version of this entire conversation and a video version in my own personal you tube channel you beaconed gilbert we will continue the conversation there but for now we will leave off for today here on scythe
1547.79,1551.6, pressed in contra delighted dogs made the trip up here
1551.72,1562.52, there was definitely a divine point men when we ran into each other and the arkansas we were glad to come up here again and by which we are saved because again at the end of the day
