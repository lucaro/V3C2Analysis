0.03,7.08, on the first reconstruction of fellatas last morsinia
7.14,16.17, indiscretion to asako what are his present been to subside the bastimen bagatelles
16.44,20.34, there at your mentioning that was as 
21.18,27.06, i mean we were listening to you i mean so much we were just going to high school so would definitely been listening to a lot of
27.27,32.31, his still are parasital pleasures incinerate er but one really interlace
33.99,38.97, rationalists like fashions in her bag
39.18,46.98, kinytakooro nothing against the lands personally i mean like i don't listen to our early music and think that our 
46.98,57.66, that are as are obvious in the side of what we are doing or maybe or earlier so that obviously wasn't released as he terribly we had to pump banterings and that sort of thing but 
57.87,59.7, i think ultimately
59.73,69.3, the only real common connection between like what i what i was listening to what we righted her as fired by it is like just stratonica relocate
69.33,73.47, most of it lessened now as they are beyond
73.59,80.94, condescend like i very rarely like really like attached to anything that would be specific to our oroondates think that's
81.12,85.71, onything that may be is attracted for people like i think they are always imagining that 
85.86,112.38, justin in a back johnson to his rector with him like we were talking about music the other night and i was like oh yetive that he would only listen to music that sounds like him but it's diculous because most of the time it's actually could be further from the truth northington haven't great tanungamanono just like a fantastic
112.56,117.42, to it whatever but as an art the artist part of my brain will be with all that's interesting how to
117.75,121.11, had they arrived about moliere was derangement 
121.14,123.84, your sort of constructing from 
124.14,184.26, i think if you are said the orientation from different things he was riding in a untortured on the road itself tapwater constantly moving locations especially in lighter apart american endmost atimetus if not really conducive to writing but but certainly i think you are gathering layeth of us claim not rally listen to a tonsillitis or while recording but the rest of the year your sort of picking up things like you know whether it's so consciously on the consciously you are exploring you know i think every year we expand our musical repertoire by listening to so much different stuff and i think that settlement our music and inspire us and you know kearsarge towards things that don't sound like us but then we pull things from that music and put it into our own music so and we've gotten better at doing that over the years construct to hear concludes a bit more and
184.26,190.35, you like when we were eighteen and nineteen making records and disowned like whatever was coming out of us you know i so
190.41,197.07, now there's a little more thought about it which is probably why we tried not to listen to too much music that sounds like us because we don't want to just
197.49,209.88, cycle the same ideas like our plan in our hope you know is to try to emulate and create towns that come from different jobs so like alligators a great example of otso different than anything we ever done
209.91,228.51, so influenced by serapion of like him openly know made mainstream potassic and so doesn't sound than any of those things but there are elements of it that don't not anything like what we've done before and last to me thus evolution sooner
228.57,248.94, the alienation gentianella intention of bisonette in closer to fassifern tidied it sadly for facetiously cross too late he don't want to get too used to doing the same thing over and over and again to be
249.63,251.37, like forty
251.46,256.98, i be like when they see one may in another when they re club you know that sort of a so we try to keep
258.3,265.86, possible we want these to be verstaendige don't want people to feel like they're seeing the same show that they saw last time you were in town 
266.04,276.0, we thought that he was sincere doing me these big as in the jackanapes may not be interested in seeing as in those activities offer something completely different which was
276.42,284.76, a lot of people that we play for it and overcoats small birrell small inner so just give an opportunity for us to 
284.97,287.01, a little differently 
287.1,291.3, such a show legislator lax and strode
291.33,294.18, do and be a little more flexible with the settlers
294.48,304.23, and i noticed on salthouse a pretty assenting into his well and we can any concession
304.47,316.17, playing a few tracks like properly records that we never played life before or amalie almost eerie years so that excited so they definitely be something for everybody to make
316.2,327.99, to stuff as well to you there can be no use i don't know where doing more orinoco and girls as he alone anson had a moment rosamond play out to tayspoonful
327.99,331.74, only just going to be like a bit feared and
331.98,336.96, of course i like super important tasks i love interacting with our fans and 
337.17,364.92, like i mean it's funny the we've done it quite a bit less year and they preach always asked a question and the trepassees contrary because her life whatever favorite terence of amelia you know it's so hard to pick point out in the car really but that they really want to know thereon about that like weediest back early this is their opportunity to ask you that like questions been burning inside of themselves so it's kind of exciting to do that with him if you have one question
365.7,372.51, it's not that i stoughton to because it is imitating the thing that's really interesting about
372.66,389.13, interviews and dialogue with my fancies is when its unexpected and on it something that's very thoughtful and very personal from their perspective and no part of what's challenging about to impress so holy so often the kanari think it's pity like universal levels artists and most
389.13,391.74, by treelike after about interviews
391.83,399.93, i have interviewed and i intend it like a locomotive like that's what you do in your trying so hard like
400.2,402.9, sort of a grateful like a rut
402.96,406.44, it is really hard to be inspired to answer the same questions
406.77,416.07, or some sort of inspiring new twist on the same answer that you know any one person could want anette five minutes finances
416.07,419.04, every single question that they want to ask you and
419.1,424.5, come exhausting as yours like the same thing over and over and over again something that the cuban as sometimes
424.68,434.94, t is like an asinine this really but seeing her where i found a cool way you know but that or letting interesting thoughtful thing to ask or whatever so
435.12,446.34, i mean it's not that we have these questions are anything but it's true like when someone is like what's your favorite tantamount knowin ever sit down and listen for music except for like a
446.4,448.89, we really were like
448.98,474.36, writing music like amicitiis really cool like you know we just wrote some new material for this dance artist he states and they will come out for months you know whatever and like right now like one thereafter
474.39,479.34, i like reflective or bad like it's a really tough sentence
