585.18,587.58, she had the sire the pure lost
587.82,590.73, the person so that's what
590.76,592.35, i am

604.65,606.24, it was
606.75,607.95, as 
608.04,614.04, in some petersburg this picture is taken to a two a m in the morning
614.16,626.04, and i looked at my rowchester and i realized that i left the place at foam so and i'm sure it was especial night for them and for me as well
628.53,632.16, for questions and
637.98,643.86, what the rest of your picture on the subject of following
643.95,647.43, natalie
649.62,660.99, yeah am so in toto fastenin russia made this new law foreboding
660.99,674.25, they call periander none traditional sexual relationships to ministrate so the middle law and so what had been trying to do is just covering all kind of aspects of this
674.52,692.16, once the home of foiled even met with some of the people who do these medios and listening to their story and then motivations and i've been in the courts to protest yet would have end and doing portraits of people
692.19,709.89, young parents who people who are risking to get fired from the cabinet this is one aspect in a greater work but in the even in a greater work every single picture every single person matters so
710.61,712.68, not just you know
713.07,716.64, simple of a great story this is to interets
719.43,723.84, and maybe i should tell that yesterday i
723.84,725.52, got the message was
725.79,728.16, well and
728.34,736.74, one of my and i got to think a little bit more clear again i reached out to them and are really happy about it
737.16,738.69, the proud
740.85,745.98, any other question she ad
746.07,749.91, arise
756.6,763.44, this is important to me that this picture is not to state that just as porpoises
763.8,771.03, the okalewaha would you do now to this is not state this is a repertoire
772.62,777.93, sense your question
780.09,783.12, raise
790.44,792.72, of course 
812.43,815.31, the russian
815.52,821.25, a just a tinge
821.67,825.06, the cord you cousin is a question to the jury
825.15,828.66, because what i would just say is that
828.66,838.92, i continue in this is important to me is just that this would have for me it's not a difficult question whether a stateroom this would have happened if even i i was there
839.34,843.57, i said to them just do what you do potent that i'm not here
844.05,846.33, so that all i defined
847.14,856.35, roothing you should be well aware that this is something else and i think it's very interesting that it
856.56,868.65, this is happening i think the jury is well aware of that and they made her choice very clear and so that we'll have to see this is the 
868.77,875.7, competition and we'll see from the future on what it will bring us in the next year
877.05,889.95, something michel i think major pretty wants to make it clear that there are many
890.04,896.43, storage out there and there are very various ways to tell a story
896.55,898.2, this is an issue
898.23,900.87, and
901.71,904.08, the statement we would make
904.2,905.64, a statement
907.2,919.35, smokes are not
921.33,925.11, yet first of all your pronounced my name miss
925.23,938.37, not madame on the point macebearers old and i am a heat a wife and a son and

949.08,953.43, and 
955.8,969.24, represented by perspicuity life in germany and prospecting illy and i see my work i work contemporary watloon issues like 
969.33,982.05, news and portraits the core of my works i think its contemporary issues complicated issues and the light put myself and places where i think i can make a difference
982.14,986.7, there's not a lot of other photographers around me and if there is
986.79,993.72, then i can contribute with something that i cannot see right that's one i feel that my work
994.47,996.81, has a purpose of a strong purpose
1000.08,1006.14, you want to an you want to more no more about me
1007.55,1010.49, i i really you know i 
1010.85,1013.64, think i'm from generation of the coarse

1039.65,1041.87, tell that's what i am
1044.3,1047.87, i 
1058.25,1084.11, so i was in i was to fascinated as it swam massabesic pant at the time i was a discredited and i from the damascenes my i looked around and every one in this industry which is crying about the hard times of being documentary photographer so i said to myself what is the most interesting place
1084.29,1093.29, my time right now where is this the finding place where you should be you know the my generations adeline i would go to
1094.01,1102.77, solstitial go to san francisco so i designed it to move to change to china
1102.92,1106.34, we ended up living for two years

1129.8,1146.12, being six in through them assume i worked on it for seven years and for the two so must a case i did a work on the biggest illegal gold mine in south america in the middle of the rainforest and it is it's not just about
1147.05,1153.44, how you think up gold to me it's about how we treat each other how we treat nature
1153.89,1156.2, how we human
1156.38,1160.76, is losing or desire or greed
1160.76,1164.81, what i like about stories when it's
1165.08,1166.55, more layers
