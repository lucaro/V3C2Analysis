0.18,7.89, he 
11.22,28.98, he
46.92,60.63, body i were presenting three penal sessions here to day this being the first of three obviously the first one day were going to be fixing on what happens before the rice would happen in the preparation to a big cycling race so
60.78,67.83, i started striding about minutes until the pelton come through for their first pass up here it of the state
68.88,71.49, it
71.61,91.77, of a perception that sports psychologies all about whispering a couple of magic words in the ears of wattles and somehow making them perform a little bit better now close as that to reality and what's involved in your role the sport i cousinhood question met a it's a bad is quite a quite to reality as we are melanesian my wife
91.8,100.62, if we could do that if we could whisper magical things in the ears of the best riders then i'd be retired on the yacht somewhere and the bahamas really
100.65,110.61, what we do is we actually work with the athletes to try and understand the world in the things that may be holding them back from riding in the usual capacity they written
110.67,112.35, we 
112.56,125.13, and it's not a case of whispering anything magic a little but rather a case of listening very intently and trying understand as best as possible to try and find some solution together that they can put into plays very practical
125.19,162.72, strategies to help them in the training which is actually what makes the road passes the training that makes and roast and not the words that came for the mouth of the sports are ologies ole somehow to get lucky in the samiel like you said as sykes may feel like you said something that just help them find the wife through the particular topertoe credit for that as well absolutely none show wife ill let's go to you here in the late seventies you packed up and moved to your to try your hand at a fresh cycling over there disport psychology is a discipline exist back then or who did you go to concerns bothwell that you adjusting to life every year it
164.58,177.0, no we didn't have much to support that regard back then i mean now this hesitates academists with full ratopolis to assist the young athlete
177.06,183.24, unfortunately we didn't have that back then i'll member cleveland
183.36,186.24, we just didn't have that kind of support i think
186.81,201.75, very few riders riding at the late level in europe when i got over there quite a few writers giving a go and the comic in the circuit races in besancon for and italy
201.78,210.33, yeah already at that to make that level i had to be mentally physically pretty tough just to leave 
211.32,227.64, what is it that sets us for psychologists apart from say a partner or friend or whatever it is of a cyclone that goes over and try something new what can you bring that someone just listening to to somebody out with the gutting
227.79,241.02, well i guess the thing that differentiates from a loving partner or caroline the case by bees the relationship is one bystander confidentiality and not being on judgment 
241.05,252.81, sometimes when we talking to partners friendly may be things that we really do want to say or i feel cathelineau it can change the dynamics buttall the time but sometimes
253.05,260.73, and really it's all to bring out as you say not only hearing the things i do say but for listening to the things that they don't say
260.94,271.86, and trying to connect that together with the pitch of that they're giving us of their world to win that with things that may be may be hurting them but also thinks that a helping them for when they go and do a stoneware
271.92,278.37, so i guess we're in a really privileged position special relationship to her the most intimate stories fears
278.37,289.02, and stuff from athletes that i don't is easy to express to her friends as sometimes it can be saying as a sign of weakness again not always but these are the common things of eternity
290.01,307.26, a little bit about how you go about preparing yourself psychologically for an event such as the gig harold on tour or the torrance and gay part of your job is to work a cyclist on their bikes sat opposite as a sport physiotherapy insure comfort efficiency and and proper technique
307.47,314.01, is that sort of preparation in preparing some one psychologically as well as physically far and events such as this
315.33,323.1, well the thing that most cyclists kit to the start line they set up a pretty well intrenched however 
323.31,326.73, elective body and these guys aren't just
326.94,340.26, for these rights the preparing for several stages they are preparing for several races throughout the year so very rarely has any one get to the start line in absolutely fantastic conditions so
340.56,349.41, the role of the physio was actually about making sure that that cycles at that time can actually set on the lake and
349.44,374.97, behave as the human machine for those those those pearls and so that it's not so much just about like it up it's actually about the person and minimizing their ability to work as a machine so hunters exercising financed well
374.97,395.16, that i can do the job so set up is more is more than just the big also about the person how much seven refine and garry would i be doing with a cyclist during the belike this or or in a longer events such as the torrance of three eximius et to position and set up would to be doing a reserate things you'd be more fostering
395.85,398.52, in you know as we are saying
398.85,409.62, a ridge to the style of a stage or if in carrying a little bit of an england and assessment of those injuries might mean that for instance
409.71,423.99, be developing pine most commonly in the back and someone coming bit of a back injury and there in a situation where he got to be a very among
424.47,438.09, then that kind might be something that interfere with the performance so you assist the rider on that that day well knowing what their past history is and perhaps modify the sinopoli tle bit so that will be more comfortable
438.09,439.56, for a long period
439.59,458.64, a man that we actually have to go in with a bit of a different race plan that this radically have to get out of the settle every sorrow long every so often rather and have a bit of a stretch just to make sure that during those crucial passes and in those crucial efforts that pain isn't playing on their mind they are you know they've all learned to suffer
458.88,466.95, and that's what these guns now had to do but what i don't want to be suffering it is pain for another source other than the muscles
468.54,476.94, big part of psychological preparation for grace she moroccos in overcoming nerves anxiety in the unknowns and pioneered
477.15,488.1, you tell us a little bit about what it was like approaching your first to france back in nineteen eighty one if i'm not mistaken was the biggest psychological challenge for you coming into that race
488.76,493.26, the polarisation
493.92,501.72, a french and the one on french writer on the team and you know my job was there a domestic
502.26,510.09, you know my southey tammie got plenty of drink and you know
510.51,530.4, to the pastorate but well out while we are going along but it let them down at the parental the good job then all the good jobs here when the domestic incontro but to make sure they are tamasese were kept out of the wind and and arrive at the crucial spot as fresh as possible so and quite a bit of work on the front but
530.85,539.91, a bit of an historic time because of course my first word of riot the yellow jersey so think things sort of changed my row ataliba day five
540.12,546.12, antedating going into the event you know a different
546.51,552.09, time now of course we can go the television and see life career day and
552.33,556.35, you know in euripides you get lived
556.35,567.24, we're quite educated knows what's going on in the turret back then in a desperate reformation to find out what it was all about this as before i went over this so
567.69,568.92, different
569.01,570.63, i think a ride
570.66,579.15, heading over the europe it's possibly the more fearful because they know what to expect when i first went over there i had no idea what us embarking upon
580.74,588.54, i would raise a well on as iver bycause i was even had no idea what i say getting into
589.8,605.31, like the second time round obviously you finished the two of the first time the veteran as you said very well what's it like then coming back for the second time knowing a little bit about what the the event in tales
606.18,609.93, boys look a very fresh ground to
614.79,620.1, it was like the second time ran the torrance having done once ready
620.19,628.65, do you nothing for the second time having done it really well the first time i thought wooden had dared to have any fear of
628.65,633.0, i of about finishing the event more about you know
633.03,635.55, i can place in the event
635.7,637.38, and
637.41,644.76, i finished the top the first to anastase being out through the same with no better
645.36,656.76, the nation had to my goal early on a just a matter of defending that and ended up
657.42,676.41, the young rossett year and you know i established myself as you know is a potential winner that too on the track of a more mature but you know i think i tottered
676.68,679.62, and chantaboun
679.74,687.09, itself but i just didn't want to let my tame down and you know if you had the jersey
687.24,689.82, put a lot of pressure on you and 
690.06,719.19, still wanted to you know fear the third week you know as well as i did in the first and i see that and you know it's happy but you know my career was obviously taking a frustration dasaratha's part of his team and his first to france would you would you say to feel do you go on approachin you look you know looks like maybe he armed his struggling little bit first year in the torrance you approach him or you i seem to come to you what's what's your position there
719.22,725.16, to be honest you know i don't approach the athletes and profess to be able to say something
725.25,729.0, going on for the depending on the nature your relationship
729.09,731.22, it will involuted that
731.55,735.03, some westondale if you say anything
735.03,756.45, and all the books on toward but very rarely would alleviations you know eleatic larly forwards like enough to be in that situation it's kind of like the statuary you just go and rub the bottom with a little bit of quarantine that old old white for the athlete to come and say my
756.48,766.56, i often times its worth he met what happens in the athlete's mind if you start by walking over there to the station always has something wrong with me ever time with a really don't need to be thinking about that
766.71,770.01, so it's really worth taking the consideration the relationship
770.07,780.18, with that and often alms and to be more the couch that probably guys over and say sadly depending on what set and sam said i they have a ethereally a case of white for the authenticity
781.2,800.43, so quickly that only a calotte bit about superstitions and preparations and rituals and all that kind of thing a lot of sports people have these are things of the doing might be putting on one soft furs or my be you or loathe do before and whatever my beatitudinis plays in a sort of preparing somebody for a race a race or an event
801.96,842.28, a question i think i left think about that for a little while self and royalist he is plenty of solitude they are lucky pair of socks the lucky peer of end but each athlete and it doesn't matter whether or not cycling or or football they do have a pre race or a free vent routine that they go through a lot of people go through as far as i unsailor and not only a ride through the course for instance but there will do the roneronh their own stretching everything wants to basically confirm to them
842.49,883.56, doing everything right as it happened on the best the bride of a head and so i think very important it will retaliate also on a knowe from the body that they are going to be or to get the most out of it on that day that's actually most important for our foes a lot of them will actually do a routine of stretching a little frost on the walls make sure that those legs are able to spin and spin comfortably so i get to that den that land with as much confidence and that
884.22,898.23, little i took a little bit about pressure and expectations here and obviously clear living to the east and france is one of the favorite if not the favourite of course you know came watery and fantastic style that none of us will ever forget us by his but
898.23,905.07, how do you withstand that sort of expectation and the pressure going into a big italie that thou feel it is the slyest of pressure
906.51,909.24, ah now do i mean
909.87,920.13, put pressure on him seeing a top inept press on himself you know i don't think it should be the people around him i think there's an expectant and expectation if you're
920.13,930.0, later i ah you know potential winner of an event of yourself to put with pressure yourself at one now to be couched in that
931.92,937.29, a different way that young kids or something in that way you strong get the vitiated all the time i think
937.41,945.3, as you know i been favorite for a feast the two of france and you know he doesn't need to be reminded not like
945.36,955.74, the kids and all kichaka in over the parent sitting on the baton i go down to inaugurate it you know get all nerado
955.89,975.27, it agitation and tightened it like a dialectician the showcase quite the mouth
