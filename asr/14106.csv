1.2,5.46, i read you what i think is the most profound
5.46,7.77, yet i know
8.13,12.84, the chapter three starting at verse thirteen
18.93,25.02, i came from galilee to john at the jordan to be baptized by him
25.71,31.26, he prevented him saying i need to be bad tibo and do you come to me
32.43,37.38, he answered him let it be so for this proper for us in this way
37.59,39.99, fill all righteousness
41.64,43.2, he consented
43.59,54.18, and when jesus had been babies just as he came up in the water suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dumb
54.24,56.04, the lighting on him
57.18,61.74, a voice from heaven said this is my son
62.58,63.78, beloved
64.14,67.95, with whom i am well pleased
68.97,70.05, spring
74.64,79.83, father we've got her here to place our lives in front of your word
81.18,83.31, mortal words will do
84.12,87.75, you would be gracious to our seeking that holy word
88.05,90.45, inspired by holy scripture
90.48,94.44, only your holy spirit can speak to us
95.52,99.09, this in the name of the word made flesh
99.51,100.68, christ
104.43,114.84, earlier in matthews third chapter and and in the other gospels of the new testament were given a little description about john the baptist
115.41,121.47, probably not the kind of guy i spent a lot of time hanging around with he was a rather extreme person
122.19,125.79, that he were came hair coats
125.88,128.37, the large leather belt around it
128.64,134.07, at in the desert where he ate wild honey and locusts
134.97,138.9, really john locus
139.23,148.26, he had a habit of offending most of the people he talked to he loved to offend the religious leaders his favourite title for them was bruinbier
148.92,151.44, really catch on its religious leaders
152.67,163.47, he would come periodically out among the caves in the desert where he stayed and he would speak to a congregation of people that would gather around him and he would say to them read pep
165.21,166.74, to repent
167.07,187.8, just means to turn around the word in the greek is metanoia means if you're walking the wet you realize you are going the wrong direction you would repent turn around at the metanoia experience and you would turn a walk in the right direction so john was trying to tell people your head in the wrong direction repent yet your life right
188.04,198.24, then he would start to warn them because i'm telling you a lot the assizes coming and when he comes he is going to drag down unprintable fire from the heavens
198.54,202.62, he's going to have a winnowing forth in his hand
203.37,222.0, even know what that is but i don't think it's good he's going to use that for to separate the chaff from the fleet it's going to take the chap he's going to throw it into all that fire and those are you the bat had in the wrong direction whose life is not right you're going to get neil actually get burned
223.11,226.02, better get life right
228.69,250.11, i got a lot of dinner invitations and set the kind of person just wanted catoche hadn't really one message and it was your basic turn or burn kind of preaching at the seminary where i teach we called this bad dog preaching
250.59,263.88, preacher stands on the front congregation shakes his finger and say you bad bad dogs battalion so did bad dog don't do that in your take that outside bad dog
266.19,270.66, the fascinating thing to me as a person who's been a pastor for years now
271.71,275.76, how many people really like the bad dog sermon
276.78,291.24, sit out there like a congregation of golden retrievers hates big drooped their heads a little down they say you're right i did it again i'm a bad dog
294.45,297.06, really relatively popular
297.75,302.94, when i was at sea and graduate school at the university of chicago
303.36,309.81, professors there were just fascinated by this popularity of the bad dog preaching
310.59,313.53, they just couldn't really figure it out
313.53,317.28, and it's always been popular in fact were told
317.49,320.97, it was popular even when john the baptist was doing it
321.3,331.17, third chapter matthew tells us that the people of jerusalem and all judea were going to him all judea that is i leave out a lot
331.5,333.42, i always
333.6,342.06, popular preaching to hear this kind of judgmental warning and while these professors i had a graduate school
342.51,344.55, just couldn't figure this out
344.61,359.07, do people want to be judged and they were concerned not only by judgmental preaching in christianity but there's also a stream of this in judaism and in those days you were just paint intention to this kind of angry fundamentalist rise in islam
359.13,365.25, so these professors did what scholars will often do when they are confused they put together a panel discussion
366.33,374.64, and the highly esteemed psychologist was the first one to speak on this panel and she said that she was relatively convinced
374.82,384.27, people flock to church that's going to wag their finger at them and give them judgment and talk about fire coming from the skies
384.48,387.03, because there are convinced
387.06,396.24, the preacher is talking about somebody they don't like and in the end that guy's gun to get nailed
396.24,398.37, they make him feel better
399.48,403.62, the next person to speak was a market historian
403.86,406.59, an unfortunate thing to be these days
407.13,425.58, discredit theory but he went and into a shot at it anyway he said that the people who liked hearing all that all this judgment and destruction of what he called the proletarian of the under class of society people for whom the economic system is not working and they just on have god go ahead and blow a little fire on the whole thing and we can start over
427.11,429.84, you next
430.47,435.18, then boone and i think he was probably the person who was most confused of all
435.6,446.64, he just couldn't believe that on this side of the eighth and early century lighten that people would still believe any of us do much less religion itself is as a theologian
446.76,456.09, and he thought that the rise of judgment a religion was simply illustration of a kind of mass ethology
457.26,462.09, i went and took notes on all his stuff because
462.15,472.41, i could be on the tibet i been a pastor for a few years before going back to graduate school and i had an idea of my own
473.1,474.57, this was my idea
475.08,479.49, could it be that judgment or religion is popular
480.84,482.4, because we think
482.76,485.25, deserve to be judged
486.48,487.5, my theory
490.71,493.98, what we know best
494.64,499.08, are judged from the moment we leave the room
500.7,506.22, back i went to visit one of our new mothers in the hospital right after she had given birth
506.85,517.14, when i got to the room i noticed that she was crying and i just assumed she was just crying from exhaustion or maybe from the delight of this healthy baby boy that she had just given birth to
518.79,527.49, crying because they had just tasted her baby boy with the standardized tests for all babies called the
528.18,538.47, thank you the car test the test which they evaluate the baby from one itasca and her little boy had a twisty tower something he didn't get a ten
538.65,544.44, perfectly healthy baby bathing in a tent on the test
544.44,547.95, she said he's only been a live one day
548.52,554.25, already got his first be minus
555.99,575.13, so it will go for every other day for the rest of his life there is always somebody taking a judgment upon you you will constantly be judged by your friends by your teachers the coaches your college your spouse your employer
575.16,580.02, hating anybody you know a lot about being judged
580.32,583.92, judged by our parents when we were children
585.42,590.85, we are judged by our children when we become parents
592.2,595.32, and we are judged most of all
595.35,597.27, most severely of all
597.39,603.0, a person who just keeps showing up in the bathroom mirror
604.98,606.36, the judgement
606.9,609.03, almost never
609.15,610.32, no
612.72,613.95, sure
615.03,617.34, join all of judea
617.4,621.09, stand with them on the banks of the jordan river
621.51,627.33, here john bad dog sermons not good enough hopewell say
629.76,631.17, preach it john
632.82,640.5, so the people would only come and hear these severe sermons but they would also be babies which is why we call him john the baptist
641.16,645.63, john the baptist baptism was different than christian baptism
646.17,647.7, people come and
647.76,664.17, they say i'm going to do better basically what they're saying when they hear john sermons you're right i'm going to repent i going to turn life around i'm going to get things right and to symbolize that they would go down to the jordan and john would pour water on them as a symbolic way of saying he's going to wash away their sins
664.86,668.04, if we could ever do that through our own effort
668.25,673.32, at the next week people would go back to jerusalem and all judea and they would keep sitting
674.07,678.12, so they would go back to the jordan the next week
678.24,685.95, confessor sends once again get all washed up and clean up again and the futility of this just kept going on and on and on again
686.91,689.25, the next time they'll get it right
690.06,692.82, you see john's religion was not complicated
693.27,698.67, it's up to you to fix your life and if you do when the judgment comes you'll be spared
700.26,709.14, i think we like john's message or at least we understand it because frankly it's the same religion we face and school and at work
709.83,711.9, tragically often at home
712.23,720.3, a religion that says it's up to you to work harder and things aren't right it's because you have tried hard enough
723.12,730.38, reason we like that message is that it appeals to something heroic and us we think we just try a little bit harder
731.16,734.79, next time we'll get it right it would things aren't going well
734.88,744.06, we get off freakish control we try to altoncroft but their lives the people around this thinking that if we just took control we make things right for everybody
745.47,749.1, working for anyone in the room by the way
749.76,752.55, of course not who thinks they have life
752.97,754.08, it
754.41,757.59, we keep trying different ways to get life right
757.86,761.37, the matter what your end is you're never going to make life right
761.52,762.66, your own
764.31,769.59, recent article in the atlantic monthly fascinating articles written by
769.89,771.87, psychologists
772.98,778.29, noting a significant change in what their finding and their thirty accessions
778.38,780.48, those who are in their 
781.44,788.85, there's the theory of the psychologist and the therapist is that those who are in their twenties were raised by baby boomers
789.06,795.57, there baby boomer parents thought that they could make their lives right if they just work hard enough to become a success
796.59,800.22, and they did work hard i may of them did become a success
800.37,802.74, they stood in feel like their life was right
803.13,812.82, he started having children they decided they were going to raise their children differently and they the parents said i just want my kids to be happy
813.48,829.14, so for years these children were raised in homes where their parents did everything to insure their children's happiness is to try to make sure they didn't hurt they weren't and want and whatever the kids wanted here needed they wanted to make sure they got them because they just wanted happy kids
830.16,835.47, that has created its own set of problems now there are two nicely from the kids who were raised in that environment
835.62,838.59, he gave a wonderful case study on the young woman
838.8,841.26, he came to see her therapist and said
841.65,843.78, i'm just not happy
844.83,852.45, this kind of kicked into all the things he would normally then do when some one says that he started to talk about her parents
853.2,862.17, describe your father to me expecting her father to be very distracted with business and didn't give her much time but she said no my
862.47,867.42, father were around me all the time i was very compassionate very caritas always at home 
867.54,870.24, at dalveen like crazy
872.88,874.56, about your 
875.22,877.53, he was like very critical
877.56,884.85, no my man is completely accepting and we stay at night late talking and to the truth she's my best friend
887.01,899.25, well about the rest of your life turns out that she's now in her own apartment which she loved she's an a job that she thinks is just perfect for her she has a really good and supported friends who around her all the time she drives a totally cool car
900.0,903.15, there is not lettighiere you here
903.21,905.79, she says well
905.91,907.92, of course i am happy
908.43,910.59, i think i could be happier
912.66,916.74, so then the psychologists and the therapist began to theorize
917.52,926.1, these men and women and this article who are making these theories give no evidence of any spiritual commitment but they make up her found spiritual insight
926.43,929.73, happiness is fine when it comes along the way
930.27,932.58, you make it the goal of your life
932.67,937.68, going to inevitably dismantle the blessings that you have been given
939.12,940.5, happiness
940.98,942.36, make you
944.31,955.83, there is that's the point today just as success cannot make your life right even if you get all the circumstances of your life arranged just perfectly and you should be happy that's not going to make you right either
956.46,958.74, one thing that will make you right
959.25,972.69, we find in our text to day the day when jesus price the son of god the messiah the one who saves showed up at the banks of the jordan river for people were trying so hard to get their life just right
973.35,985.11, just as easily have showed up at the next job interview or the next day or the wedding reception where retirement party whatever other next thing you think is going to make your life right
985.53,990.81, all actually just as futile as going into the water and trying to wash away sin
993.87,996.15, does show up at the waters
996.39,998.13, the season
998.28,999.78, he points to him
1002.18,1007.25, this is the guy been warning you about this is the messiah
1008.06,1015.26, two john dismay jesus does not pull fire down out of the sky did even bring his winnowing fork
1015.32,1020.78, mister comes up to johnny says well actually
1021.74,1023.69, to apply for baptism
1025.13,1026.9, what
1027.2,1032.15, you may even worthy entire box you should advise
1032.48,1036.92, the guard about you're the standard were trying to meet
1038.54,1040.61, about this a little while
1041.99,1043.91, in the argument
1044.0,1048.71, as is his nature
1050.3,1052.91, argument with this line
1053.15,1054.77, at
1054.8,1056.42, necessary
1056.72,1058.91, fill all
1059.0,1060.56, righteousness
1061.94,1064.82, what will make all people
1065.27,1066.41, right
1067.67,1069.59, the saviour comes to them
1069.74,1071.72, identified with them
1071.93,1074.87, so jesus this one who is
1075.11,1077.12, completely without sin
1077.21,1087.89, identified with the futility of the human condition the badges jesus is much like his incarnation when he is born its one coming to be with us among us
1089.06,1094.49, changes everything this is now how we're made right not by trying harder
1094.61,1097.85, we made right by a guy who's come to find us
1098.84,1101.6, what makes us right being with god
1101.63,1105.71, only grace at all about what god does not what we do
1108.29,1109.49, jesus
1110.69,1116.06, submits to john's baptism for sinners this one who was completely without sin
1116.36,1131.24, son of god when he identifies and takes his place among all humanity the heavenly father is so excited that he rips back the skies and he says this is my son the beloved with whom i am well pleased
1133.25,1137.15, is god's idea of saving our lives
1137.78,1146.54, if you just try harder you will eventually become good enough nowhere in the bible are we ever told that god is ever impressed with any human being trying hard
1149.0,1150.68, please god
1151.19,1153.74, it is so pleased with jesus
1155.03,1156.47, he found 
1157.4,1166.22, a very significant that jesus does not receive the designation of being the beloved son of god the beloved
1166.25,1167.69, it is bad
1168.02,1176.42, love does he misunderstand narratives are wandesborow the virgin maria it shows that that is bad tis
1177.23,1180.47, a time when jesus identifies with us
1180.62,1194.57, and an identification that is so total and so complete that when the heavenly father says this is my son the beloved he saying that about you too because at that point you've been identified with jesus
1197.3,1198.86, the beloved
1199.85,1201.35, the father
1201.68,1204.35, so he
1207.95,1212.33, you remember how much you always wanted to hear those words from your dad
1215.18,1216.65, it was 
1216.74,1222.98, school or athletics or some other goal you gave your best ever you try as hard as you could but
1223.04,1226.25, again the judgment was not really good enough
1227.81,1230.27, we have given anything
1230.66,1235.31, i would have just come up and put his armor on your shoulders and said
1238.55,1239.78, you
1240.98,1242.63, i am so
1242.93,1243.92, please
1246.44,1249.08, had fathers who were great at that
1249.71,1252.83, he had fathers who were too broken to ever say that
1254.78,1260.69, proclaimed this is exactly what the heavenly father proclaims to you
1262.04,1263.54, he loves you
1264.32,1266.6, could not be more pleased with you
1267.41,1270.08, because of what you've done or not done
1271.46,1274.88, pleased with you because of what jesus has done
1277.94,1279.23, brought you home
1280.07,1283.25, that's what makes you right being that home with the fat
1283.79,1289.28, the solidity to protest to say you know i may not be a saint but
1289.97,1291.98, i'm not the worst person i know
1293.06,1295.01, everything right
1295.01,1297.71, i done some things i can think of
1297.95,1299.99, to
1300.65,1310.04, because they look i worked hard through my whole life i really and i worked hard i'm not asking for much from god i just want what i deserve
1311.6,1312.56, really
1313.85,1322.58, and solemnized as a pastor when some man in the church was saying our group isn't getting enough of the budget and we do a lot around here and
1322.61,1324.98, we just want what we deserve
1326.12,1330.41, a smile an i hear that phrase and i said no
1331.31,1337.97, now what you want when it comes to god
1338.42,1343.67, the last thing you want is what you deserve
1344.18,1350.78, you want is what you need and what you need is great
1351.68,1353.51, giving you
1353.81,1356.24, self in jesus christ
1358.16,1360.98, in christian baptism
1361.07,1364.01, jesus identified with our futility
1364.04,1369.32, in christian baptism we identify with jesus love for us
1369.53,1374.72, we identify with this guy who came in only to find us but who went to the cross
1374.72,1384.14, for our sins for everything that was never right enough taking on the judgment for us dying to love us
1385.52,1393.86, some bad times we accept that we take it on we receive this extraordinary gift of love and that changes
1393.86,1397.91, all of the rest of your days if you pay attention
1398.15,1400.31, a voice from heaven saying
1400.97,1402.59, so pleased with you
1407.3,1409.04, father's day
1409.16,1410.87, i think about my dead
1412.1,1416.15, my dad was also a pastor
1416.9,1419.51, my uncle was a pastor
1419.84,1421.91, brother who's a pastor
1422.69,1425.78, i'm a pastor is kind of our family business
1425.84,1431.63, he scares our guys quite a bit actually insistance to do
1431.78,1434.18, my dad
1434.45,1438.29, with very big on verse memorization
1438.62,1444.38, and every sunday woodsite a little white card that had a burst typed out on it
1444.86,1449.9, and we had to have that scripture verse memorized by the following saturday at dinner
1450.17,1451.7, a dinner
1453.56,1460.52, dad would point to one of us on saturday night he would say whatever that verse was the reference romans
1461.48,1467.21, start chirping away all things work together for god for those who love god and their calling according to his purpose
1467.48,1470.09, dad would excuse you from the dinner table
1470.27,1474.47, to your room until you memorize the first that you can come back and finish dinner
1475.04,1478.25, as a kid did not get any of this
1478.79,1482.24, concept baffled me memorizing the verses 
1482.36,1490.82, and they're all written down right here
1490.85,1498.95, my father was very worried about the godless communist coming to steal our bibles like they did in china and
1499.13,1501.41, go you can tell
1501.92,1503.63, that was going to happen
1503.93,1509.42, my verses because i was not leaving that dinner table on saturday night
1510.98,1517.94, to all these persons inside me without ever really paying attention to them i memorize them because i really had to
1520.13,1524.48, o my brother gary we had an older adopted brother
1524.6,1526.28, who was
1526.79,1528.17, i
1528.98,1541.07, and my parents eternalized their grief and neither of them did it a very good job with it as a result of that the grief became a source of separation in their marriage a lot of the other pressures in their marriage
1541.31,1543.98, just kept drifting further and further apart
1544.43,1547.91, i was years old my mom left my dad
1548.75,1555.83, we were raised on long island and new york my mom had family and dallas texas if she flew to dallas texas
1555.98,1558.11, told my dad she wasn't coming home
1558.23,1565.61, then she had a bit of a break down and spent a lot of time in and out of treatment in dallas
1566.21,1571.16, most days churches didn't really know what to do when the pastor went through a divorce
1571.37,1577.85, and so the church asked my dead just to leave quietly which is what he did
1578.96,1582.5, my father was kind of a john the baptist kind of preacher himself
1582.71,1585.26, so he was so shamed
1585.29,1593.78, the failure of his marriage he was so ashamed that he could live up to his own sense of trader message
1593.99,1599.33, i was so ashamed that he lost the church that he had actually planted and started himself
1600.11,1606.89, little about the grace of god and so my dad with all this shame and no sense of god's grace or forgiveness
1607.19,1609.95, one day i got in the car and just drove away
1610.19,1612.53, my brother and i never saw him again
1613.31,1617.84, so i was sixteen years old all this happened the course of one summer
1618.62,1621.8, mom has gone and is not coming back
1622.04,1624.53, my father got in the car one day and just left
1625.07,1627.83, and i know it was going to happen
1629.0,1632.6, my older brother who was at cornell university of the time
1633.23,1635.06, to drop out of school
1635.48,1637.43, he came back to the island
1637.43,1639.86, got a job working construction
1640.37,1643.73, just so that he could support me to i could finish high school
1644.81,1646.85, always been my hero figure
1650.63,1660.23, summer we were trying to figure what we're going to do and a kind of an our future would be things were made more complicated when the church came to us and said you know
1660.32,1669.2, sorry about what happened to your parents but were trying to move on from all of this and so we think it probably better you guys found another church
1669.59,1677.75, and the man acourse had to move out of the parsonage were living so we got a apartment that my brother paid for with this
1677.75,1682.43, tom of the line construction job or he was carrying tenderloins
1682.64,1683.84, to high school
1685.58,1689.66, talk about it too much through the fault which you may find difficult to believe
1689.75,1691.76, unless you've had teenage boys
1692.06,1700.76, which give you other like great was sharing their feelings and we didn't care to do that with each other we just got our heads down and kept moving
1701.0,1702.53, they got to christmas
1703.34,1708.8, we decided that we should go to see our mom because she was feeling better and she thought she could see us
1708.8,1710.09, by the
1710.36,1713.84, she was in dallas we were on land in new york
1714.11,1716.45, we didn't have money to fly down there
1716.48,1720.11, my brother's old that pick up was an about to make it that far
1721.1,1722.93, have money for bus ticket
1723.32,1725.75, we did what
1725.78,1728.69, boys will sometimes do when they're not thinking clearly
1729.35,1730.61, the
1730.76,1743.36, ah that first day we got about as far as the hanoverian virginia we were on interstate and we started to get dark which was a bad osgood hall if you're traveling on your thumb
1743.66,1744.92, and one day
1745.22,1749.21, getting dark and then to our dismay and started snowing
1750.68,1754.28, imagine that you're driving down a snowy inter state
1754.82,1760.46, and it's dark and you see two guys with back packs on the side of pitching
1760.76,1762.32, not going to pick them up
1763.31,1768.2, you should not be and
1768.35,1776.6, it snowing harder and harder and harder the cars get going by every one had listened to the advice and they were going past us
1776.93,1779.81, then there are fewer and fewer cards
1780.92,1785.93, then there was a long long period where there were no headlights at all
1786.5,1791.18, so for the first time my brother and i started to talk about what had happened to us
1791.87,1796.04, was the one who said you know it's just a citharoedi wrong here 
1796.16,1798.74, his judgment on this
1799.52,1800.66, i
1800.99,1802.55, just feels like we're
1802.85,1804.14, sable
1804.62,1807.71, everybody even your parents begin to get by without you
1808.61,1817.94, he was about as far as we could go with the conversation but that was exactly right this was a dark dark night realizing that we were in a dark dark time of life
1819.23,1826.46, time to heave like finely showed up and thankfully slowed down and rolled up in front of us
1827.18,1831.92, i realized it was the virginia state trooper
1832.07,1837.83, it was a very gracious kind trooper who got out of the car came up to us and said
1838.31,1841.22, i don't know how to tell you this but
1841.43,1846.5, lose this interstate two hours ago
1846.56,1853.4, so for two hours we've been hitch hiking on a closed interstate
1853.61,1860.45, in addition to feeling disposable we feel stupid
1861.71,1869.24, the trooper said i tell you what i have an accident i got to get to the uproad let me take care of that
1869.45,1873.5, swing back around if i can get back here and i'll pick you up
1873.83,1880.94, and i'll take you to a dinner where you can spend the night and that's exactly what eventually happened it took him a long time to get back
1881.09,1890.06, come back he took his two editor the next day we got her eye with a trucker who took us almost all the way to dallas and we did have a reunion with our mom
1890.96,1896.99, during those that long long period of time or we were waiting for the topertoe back we were just stuck
1897.11,1901.16, this exit ramp of an inter state all by ourselves in the snow
1901.76,1903.02, nothing to do
1903.77,1905.51, trying to get through the dark night
1905.96,1909.74, able to talk too much about what had happened to us we had to do something
1910.25,1915.35, we tried uisneach other on sports statistics but eventually you run out of even that stuff
1915.98,1917.81, he was quiet for a while
1918.62,1920.84, then my brother looked at me
1921.35,1923.9, even use my father's voice
1924.11,1925.22, said
1925.52,1931.82, i 
1932.15,1934.31, spent the rest of that night
1934.31,1938.48, these verses of scripture that we had memorized
1938.9,1940.76, had never heard
1941.84,1944.15, that night i was ready to hear them
1946.55,1949.31, when i got to say
1950.9,1952.49, became overwhelmed
1956.42,1958.82, called you by name and you are mine
1959.03,1962.06, when he passed through the waters i will be with you
1963.26,1965.21, i will not overwhelm 
1966.05,1971.03, when you worked in the fire you will not be burned and the flame will not consume you
1971.18,1973.37, you are precious
1975.41,1977.24, honored in my sight
1978.56,1981.14, and i love you
1983.36,1985.01, i knew
1985.4,1987.29, that darkest night
1988.19,1990.29, i had the love
1990.32,1992.06, heavenly father
1992.39,1994.19, would never
1995.39,1996.38, leave
1997.91,2003.25, i would never be abandoned by the love and i knew that his bad office things seemed to that point
2003.25,2005.86, i could take on anything
2005.92,2008.8, because my dad loved me
2009.88,2018.19, he would always be with me and always love me my heavenly father was pleased with me when you know that you are made strengthen them
2018.43,2020.56, take on whatever happens in life
2020.71,2025.63, fearless because that's what perfect love does it cast out fear
2026.11,2031.9, every father day i remember that what christians are really celebrating is the law of a heavenly father
2032.23,2037.33, the only one who can love you with perfect love that cast out all fear
2037.51,2041.11, you see a flaw and broken as my parents were
2041.62,2042.73, at least
2042.82,2044.56, gave me this
2044.74,2048.16, give me something stronger than they were
2048.31,2056.98, when they could not be there for me i knew that heavenly father was and frankly for all of you who are mom's and dad's is may be your greatest calling
2057.43,2061.81, still into your children's heart something stronger than you are
2062.29,2068.62, some day they're going to need a lot stronger than the one you have for them they're going to need the love of a heavenly father
2069.04,2073.15, the only perfect love there is and the only one that can cast out fear
2075.49,2079.3, to have found this perfect love of god and the low places
2080.26,2082.63, enjoy the rest of the ride
2083.05,2088.69, tousand dons and life and it's not so much scaramuchios it's adventure to them
2089.08,2090.22, because
2090.43,2103.0, they're not going to get anywhere where there below the love of god if you found the love of god in a low place as you can enjoy the upset the down it's all the way of experiencing more low but you're never going to go lower than the love of god you cannot
2103.51,2111.04, which is why those who have said yes to the grace of god the father and common who says i'm so pleased with you
2111.34,2118.69, all kinds of adventures risk i've been through so many risky things in my life
2119.14,2122.17, because i expect to succeed
2122.23,2124.24, clear about that 
2124.57,2126.73, i have not succeeded
2127.24,2130.96, take risk because i don't care if i fail
2131.38,2133.12, the one
2135.01,2140.92, i found a lot of god in the low places you can't fail below the love of god or not no matter how
2141.1,2147.46, the risk or the adventure are the passion effort goes no matter how bad the judgment is
2148.66,2150.34, still get the long
2150.34,2153.1, perfect love that cast out all fear
2153.37,2155.5, how bad can it be like

2184.24,2193.81, of god was still there this perfect love that casts out all fear the people who believe that the father is pleased with them are the three people i know
2194.29,2207.16, no slave to any one else's judgment they will not be judged not by their parents not by their children not by their spouse not by their spouse not by their boss not by themselves
2207.46,2216.37, not be slaves to low self esteem they will not be slaves to the mistakes and the failures and the sins of the past
2216.52,2223.33, not be slaves to some illusion that the next idea was surely make their lives right
2224.86,2227.11, they had been set free
2227.53,2235.0, father too
