27.84,30.18, had her weapon family confidential
30.21,65.13, you anne it is a pleasure to be here thank you so much for making the time in your day in the work that you do and i just want to let my listeners now that you are a person who helps people it's cancer survivor yourself and for cancer support around family issues and what we're going to be talking about to day is how to have conversations with kids around difficult topics specifically around parents health issues and they may be more broadly so if you please give us a little background for yourself and your story
65.4,148.74, thanks i was diagnosed with a really were cancer eleven years ago my daughter was only three months old when i was diagnosed so here i'm a new man and i'm diagnosed with a cancer called malignant charleville ma and was told i essentially again fifteen months to live well so yeah being a new man on mentalities to sink her second birthday in nothing will cause a man to fight harder than something like that so we sought out treatment half across the country out in boston i live in minneapolis and i we flew to boston and actually had a relay crazy invasive surgery i had my entire left long removed in during that time my baby girl had the gulliby parents her grandparents and she had delivered them for three months so i missed you basically three months of her life while i was recovered from surgery and that's not well you sign up for when you sign up to be apparent you know what i'm thinking i'm thinking about all the post partum stuff the idea that your body has just given birth his beautiful child and you want nothing more than to bond with that child and now you're dealing with severe and in very scary health issues and
148.83,184.11, yeah it was the worst time of my life i i just every time i see a six and seven month old baby i'm distrain the them because i missed that time when molly was a baby and so i'm always drawn to be so babies when i see them and and i think it's because i missed that time and so loeben raised with the knowledge of me having cancer and slighting cancer and going for checkups she is a known thing different so this advocacy was born out of
184.26,196.35, living in or out of necessity and personal experience so just helping parents through the tumultuous times is really a passion of mine
196.53,201.0, i can't understand it absolutely now you see your daughter
201.39,237.57, grew up with this reality in her life and so i'm sure there were times when she became more aware than as you know when your old or two year old or maybe maybe not wise she was actually asking pointed questions and i like you telitetti when when she was old enough to have an awareness and maybe be comparing your stamina and help to those of the parents as she saw of her of her friends and an cowed did you respond to questions concerns worries she might have
237.6,247.89, well she noticed i you know i don't know how old i was probably kindergarten she noticed that i didn't have the stamina to other parents dead but i really
248.04,293.7, tried to do as much as possible like i was really involved with her class room and i would do things she just knew that i couldn't like climb on the playground or you know runs much because i had one law that an i just couldn't do as much but she was always cool about it she always has michieson shows one long as she can do it automatically has been without has been very matter of fact about it and it wasn't until she was like maybe six or seven but i think the severity of it in what cancer really was started to creep into her mind probably because of books they read at school or things they talked about or maybe just us talking you know i was getting ready to leave for an appointment in boston
293.82,316.44, she had a tomahawk the gambling to me her mamma like all well maybe something you had and then she has been and she looks up a man that tears start welling up and she's like i'm afraid and they said well what are you afraid of she was i'm afraid to stand or going to come back good what if what if you had bad scans mom and that really
316.89,328.71, it home to me that she knows what's going on that she understands you know she was pretty young at the time and so i just took the time to sit down with her and explained to her
328.98,457.56, in pretty much the best detail that i could that i'm seeing the best doctors and the reason they do go to boston so much or at the time it was boston was to make sure stand top o things onything were to happen we could take care of it and that i would continue to be here for her so as just reassuring her or in making sure that she knew that why i was doing this was for the best and not just because i had to there were staying in front of it and were not catching up to aneta's a really great way to frame an the kids can understand that it's kind of like this these are protective and preventative measures i know they understand that like i'm just imagining okay it's raining outside and so you put on your periods so that your feet don't get wet they have kind of things are things that a kid can understand and i love the way your describing the calmness and the amount of detail you gavorting so she understood what scans were and in all of that stuff so when you do advocacy work heather with parents who may have older children at the beginning of a diagnosis when they first get it how do you help them maybe with some kind of advice or even even a script or talking points when when a parent has to talk about a diagnosis for a life threatening disease you know a lot of parents that i talk to their kids are adult children because the patients are much older but there are the few that have kids who are six seven years old and the thing is i'm not here to tell people the right way to do things because i think with each individual person the way you handle in his right i think pretending nothing is wrong is probably the biggest mistake a person can lavishing again that's that's my own thing but if that at what feels right to the patient the macwitty have to do my job as a man beat is not to tell somebody
457.62,460.53, the right way or the 
461.37,477.63, more to port them in their decision and maybe suggest things that might work better i never want to come for people of a no at all just because of work for me doesn't mean that it's going to work for suadente street you know being a friend and honest does not always
478.02,499.2, the right way for some people have a ansome kids frankly can't handle it some kids teased to know he says and they can only handle little bits at a time and till those people know their kids barbette than i would i know it works for my lily and cameron my husband and i know it works for her but i can
499.2,504.06, say that would work for my friend susie and her son max okay so 
504.09,518.55, i come to you i tell you that i have a year old and i was just diagnosed with stage for breast cancer and obviously i'm devastated in my eleven year old is very tune in to me it's not
518.61,528.54, kind of person who likes to sugar coat things but i don't want to dump a whole bunch of scary stuff on my eleven year old and
528.69,531.21, so help me please
531.66,584.01, i would say you know your kid better than anybody how much do you feel that they can they can handle you know they need to know what's going on they know your sick can your intuitive they know you're sick and they know you don't feel good they need to know that you're going to fight your doing everything that you can't they want to know that your fighting and that you know they don't want their lives to change a lot because i think a lot of kids fear that their lives are going to be upreaching because they like security so making sure that the kids are secure as possible i think is really important and that there that yet things are going to be concrete man's going to be sick and there might be a few days where mom just can't get out of bed but we need to be patient and this is the best journey that were on right now and this is a time that we can really take and spend together and i try to mind people
584.43,620.94, to really cherish that time and be in the moment because you don't know what's going to happen and i wouldn't promise like oh i'm going to get cured emilia hundred per cent because you don't know and but just you know we're doing everything we can tell your child we're doing everything we can to fight this i'm going to do the best i can and he needum partner in this and i mean to help take care of me and i think in rolling eleven year old in the chair giving yes not as the caravan as a partner in york there you know put up and watch a movie with me while i recover from the king
622.74,624.15, oh
625.32,626.19, the
626.19,631.17, part of the journey not just a tangle on and try to keep things
631.53,633.63, as
633.72,676.32, then they mean to keep our discordant then the other thing that i think is really important is resources there are camps called camp come which is by kids never gone but i've talked to other parents who have sent their kids and it's a campaspe four kids of cancerous being around other kids who know and her gone same thing is so important and so it's finding those resources for the kids of therapist is a good thing you know carisfort groups whatever they need to help get through this you know tell people school what's going on so the teachers know that's a big important part is i have told every single teacher
676.38,749.82, that my daughters had at that i go to houston agostin said a boston my doctor moved but i tell them that i traveled twice her for these checkups that i was let them to live in so louisa little distracted or she seems worried preoccupied that's why so it's enrolling the community you know your immediate community in with your care so they know what's going on so they can raptorial in that bubble as well in rolling the teachers and rolling the cuberta girl scout troop and try to keep things as normals possible for it you made some wonderful points here had the things that i might not necessarily have thought about the top of my head but i was the coroner experience you know what works but i think even though you say everybody every kid is different every feeling situations different these are great take ways the idea of getting support for your child and the idea of a group of some sort be it a camp or support group that's landorian therapist where there are other kids who are going through similar kinds of things at home so that they can open up and not feel like the odd person out deleting
749.82,791.34, teachers know and empowering you kid to open up to friends so that friends know what's going on i think that what we know about trains and tens as they often put a mask on underfeeding of vulnerability and that as a whole other level of stress to what's going on if they can be open and honest with close friends about what's going on those friends again can act as part of the bubble when when other people are kind of intruding and your child who dealing with so much other stuff needs some more defensive on the other day that you mention which i that is brilliant is in
793.02,855.27, including the child in the care giving team in an appropriate way obviously so that the child isn't feel like as you say a tagging helplessly there is something so empowering is like i'm helping my mom or my dad get better by bringing her a cup of tea by sitting with her by rubbing her shoulder if that's what she wants where i could say what can i do to help mamatee thing's fine honey i think i think that's the three beautiful and very able things i really made story to add on to that when i was going through surgery eleven years ago and met this wonderful family her name was lea and her husband david was in the hospital very very sick and her daughter mother daughter emma was there with them leonese could be but she wanted to be there as much as possible they lived i think an upstate new york but came to boston for treatment and
855.57,861.75, she enrolled in the carrying of david and when david went home on hospice ma
861.75,875.46, right there along helping change the drains the chest tubes taken care of everything now fast forward eleven years that thirteen year old girl is now a nurse because she was so moved
875.58,885.39, so impacted by taking care of her dad when he was on you know his death bed and hospice and in the hospital and being enrolled in that
885.45,916.77, she's taken it to the next level in her life were now she is she's a critical care nurse and she graduated copperplates now through the magic of face and still friends with them so it's been amazing to see em aground go through school and become a nurse and invocation ate about it because of the life experience the other part of that is i see it is that when you give kids an opportunity to be you man in their humanity they grow in all kinds of whims so this is you know as a
916.83,919.05, challenging as
919.08,955.56, this is for a family the more we can come together the more we can all grow through it i believe that sincerely well good stuff here only ever get a minute left already i know goodsoul love it if you give our sisters of yours an opportunity of where they could find out more about your work on the web you can buy my loathesome on twitter weatherbeaten integram
