8.01,14.79, i overmuch so to day i want to do something which is a bit career oriented so
14.85,41.43, a scientist of been working his national research for best part of years and i want you some feeling for the journey that got from a student to an international researcher and as an example of the kind of career pathsides can follow and along the way illustrates some of the things that are done and lead up to basically this exciting you big project all the escherich is hopefully get revolutionized scientific ology in australia
41.43,108.03, so it's a number of points i want to make along the way in this journey my particular my personal sort of take on being a sideshow business i think this always particularly my case does build upon passions they build upon interest that kids get in school that's where it all starts as restorations where it starts with them too so i'll go and talk about some of these but during the talk building a passion from school hoosiers and trust are honest agrees and gapes at paredes why would you do one how do you build a global career in science and lasted out laces ashes there a way back home to us australians in upwell over the world and a lot of us to come home and it's a great thing to be able to come on like i just did recently so to those are some of the things i want to talk about during the talk to day in trismegistus for some of the young people it might be involved so i did grow from the passion school i had a great science teacher in about you even that gave me the passion for science in general but it took me quite a while to sort of hundom interest astronomy it wasn't till i did
108.03,118.74, physics greenest rang and then finally at the end of that physics degree an honest degree in the fourth year that where i had exposure to qualities and so they got me realistic undecided
118.74,123.42, strongly in particular and why astronomy because astronomy is
123.45,153.78, one of those first all ground is an amazing area to do research because there's so much to be done it's not like some of the other here since internationally like physics and chemistry and biology with thousands hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people working in astronomy in astrophysics you've got the whole universe to play with and their enormous number exciting challenges its stormy international is not a big subject you can know all your peers and friends and so it's a very very exciting place to do research work so i decided to research work in a stormy
153.99,253.14, every willing on after honest degree estaminet to the australian university in camera to mount transitory where i did my thesis seventy eight to eighty menstrual place in the hills outside the camera and fortunately was burnt the much to the ground in two thousand and three by an almost forefather's faceremus left but it was a great place to do research work and when you choose a place to do research and become research side as you should always choose a place which is wallachian there's nothing better for your career than to be taught by the very dispeople and for those very bespoke to talk about you and your work when they go overseas to contract or so being in an excellent internationally excellent place is absolutely ideal for your career as a research so i went to a strongly got i was a bit of her theoretical kind computational kind of guy from the early days i wasn't somebody who stuck biborate escape and looked through it all night i was really somebody who loved to play with computers and so i use that sort of passion in computers and mathematics to understand the dynamics the motions of galaxies in particular what happens when galaxies come very close together and actually collide supreme mating process and so in the bottom of this little sliding sea that filling messed up looking picture of two galaxies which were in the process of collision and the little movie now is a computer simulation of what happens when two galaxies collided and all these tales and bridges and whisps and filaments are all made during the collisions of galaxies as this is a kind of work i did for my tastes forestless and research work is not just about using telescopes to battening out and doing things in mathematics and computers particularly these days were computers are important but odin research
253.83,258.6, so i did my bachelor years and then almost a
258.84,315.93, the day after i finished i was kicked out and basically said go overseas and it gets experience because it's very important as place like australia if you're doing an international research career you do get out and meet the rest of the world you get out and exposure self to the vast majority of the researchers who are in fact of course overseas so i went from gambroon to loane in california where i took up a what's called a post doctor position after your doctor three year position at the california institute of technology or contact a pretty famous place and incredibly a good place to go because again the quality of the research staff there is pretty impressive so just underscore how impressive before i get under the compresses celticus the home over a palette hundred inch telescope used to be the world's biggest telescope very famous people like allan and ignorant have all worked at after the holsters
315.93,363.57, besides a general so just to undershaw impressive the staff is there a traditional when you are come as a new staff member of contact give a talk give it talk about your work so i was a young pestorondikat the second we is the celtic i gave one of these talk in the front row of my talk i remember this public to the day i die were sitting the three people in the bottom of this picture which is a meridian richard finally feller all three of which a noble prize winners so my orient consisted i think of seven noble prize winners three of which are in the front row so as a young australian getting his first talk over season was a little bit daunting that i survived and went on and i really enjoyed my tomcattin the quality of the people you work with the quality of your peers in the quality of the place so very important in your career projectors
364.2,424.8, after i left there i spent it at a time working out my aloneness is a very famous place it's the place where the atomicbomb the man hating project was but these days it's a huge national barteau states and it's got an enormous repository of the son of the world's largest computer system to remember a bit of a computer gig i love using computers to solve problems and so you go to where the best computers in the biggest computers are and so here is some of these monster computation objects moving around in potteries of the universe inside of a computer using mathematics and this kind of research work i was able to do overseas because i was at one
424.83,427.92, very espaces in the world again for computers
428.79,446.01, a fortune of after i left there to go to work for the humble space tells committees my work for nasa souffraria out five years on the able project this was before the haberi publico was launched in displace in fact about two days after i was there the challenges as asked her occurred in so the whole project was put
446.04,474.15, but i was there in baltimore at the university johns hopkins university in baltimore and why did i go there because again it was one of the very best places in the world where that time the hobble telescope was the biggest impress his project in the world for optical astronomy it had enormous promise to solve some fundamental problems in astronomy and so the entire world were flooding into baltimore and to the space telescopes cut spending time there in doing research there so again was rather rose in the world pretty much and so
474.54,481.17, for a young research person a great time to actually get involved and see all the researches but also to see how big
481.17,505.86, in tragic like this really works near built poles by still goats billion us dolls with her investment even in early nisan so it's again huge monster science project and i think was probably this plattered in these big signs predicts as well that as a scientist these days you have to also understand that as well as doing research you also have to be a builder and a contributor to the science you have to be able to
506.07,638.28, it in construction development and the operation of some of these very large facilities because they require everybody working together to make them all happen so i were to have all in your really enjoyed it after i left how like a back to a strafford time went back to mount dromond joined in a pretty exciting project which was a joint australian american project looking for the mysterious suffocate so dark matter is a bit of an embarrassment as we know the universe around us it about undecent full of matter of course and the only about four per cent of that matter is actually blowing it makes glasslike stars are glowings and radio so this ninety six percent of the universe is mysteriously hidden from us and it's in the form of two things one called dark matter and one called dark and enduring we have little idea what they are and where they came from we know they're theresienstadt that this dark matter has on other objects and so we decide to do experiment in australia to actually look for this dark man to actually look for signs of this dark objects in the universe that could be the stockade so he took an old telescope a really incredible telescope this think of the great milanese on his old telescope was built in eden sixty eight in dublin an island and body the victorian government from proceeding ils ship back to australia will's logistilla sitting in the relation and botanical gardens and it was a photographic telescope right at the very time when basically all the technologies were changing underneath it so i never became very productive so it fell into rosanna in the garage from about for forty or fifty years adventurous to mount strongly and weed just in off the dust throughout the cobwebs and the spiders and made into a modern telescope and to this project were there which was great on all telescopes of life amenaide this single demarche in lambole we did find the first evidence for dark mandarines and that made the front cover of nature magazine inanities you know these kinds of experiments can be done in a strong kenkenes major contributions to the field by getting together international groups of people dedicated research in particular topic again it was a matter of going to the right place at the right time
640.53,688.08, project was one of the very first projects in a strongly where there was a very reasonably large amount of data involved what we took was images of the sky italianate days an raiders amount of data that five gigantic in those days was a norman so that experience in building of project handling large amounts of data and getting a good sight of it result is going to hopothlayohola and based in munich in germany for a condor for them so they were called the european southerners over tree there the world's largest spemica organization they
688.14,700.83, thirteen european countries or put me together and found the creation of telescopes in chilly moss with sinister ear so as to big as domiciles arch organization
700.92,705.9, they were thinking at that time retailing the world's largest telescope
706.38,744.03, the very large telescope which is you know we're not very good with names which overlooks called very large telescope and it was going to be constructed in julian i was asked to come on board at ease and helped his in and build this facility and in fact put together the whole set of science and data system for the telescope so that began a twelve year adventure and running lots an new skills i was a scientist at that point i was a research sights i never been involved hands on whitsome of these noses as one billion europe i never been involved but here was a chance to learn
744.12,780.36, one is a chance to learn how to manage people manage projects manage budgets deliver on time deliver various things skills that you know where probably a little bit for being a scientist and being a researcher but i'm convinced that these days to be a good side is to be a good research and you have to understand those things as what you cannot possibly succeed in research and science these days without understanding how to design a project had to run a project had to manage people had managed by gets that's just part of the way we do sisterhood days of the white boat and the cestus i think is pretty much gone from many subjects and i think for a strongly as one of them
780.84,842.43, so i went to his and not in and started the work on the construction of the very large telescope this telescope was actually here it is finished was finished in the and one with the first light of the all for telescopes for big telescopes each telescope as a big mirror in it that was mirrielees across so huge mirrors each one those mirrors cost twenty million heroes every telescopes of that for ten fifty tons of optics and steel looming around and its nancrede machine for doing science is for individual telescopes a mountain top in chilian then highcombe but they can be combined together and also formless pictures as in a combined services is one of the pictures that was formed and the telescope for combined together this is actually a move that was made of the motions of stars in the middle of their own mockingly so over a course of many many years this telescope had such an incredible accuracy of images the actually followed the motions of stars around the center of the galaxy now the interesting thing that stiletto the sin of the galaxy
842.85,874.47, nothing there where it went around a caesar's going around something but the something isn't there and so this is the first evidence that was collected for the existence of a black hole so we believe as a black hole in the middle of our own likeways what about a million times the mass of our sun and is probably the bosom of the best evidence we have of the existence of this rather amazing object and with that is possible because we spent a billion eros because six hundred people lived on the mountain top for four or five years and constructed this amazing machine for doing science
874.47,888.48, great science comes from great machines and great machines require lots and lots of work people from all over the world working together if you're going to be a researcher you have to understand this and you have to be able to participate in international science
890.22,907.62, i decided it was probably time to come back to australia i'd been away for about years and filing away back in his part of the story australian doesn't have high mountains it doesn't have the andes it doesn't have the sort of things that is not the opportunity in australia to build big telescopes
907.62,917.85, and hence stralia uses other people stuff in natural the time and it was absolutely amazing to me that i discovered that there was a real chance
917.85,922.98, probably the world's biggest estimate of facility actually coming to australia so
923.01,926.91, a chance in the single square column
927.18,957.51, would come to western australia so i packed my bags in my family and headed toward the stralia and was lucky enough to get a position at the university was astral's primus fellow to begin building up a brand new research group in west astral in anticipation of this project coming but also to help australia wind this project because at the moment we are in a race though our protectorate two places in the world where you could put this telescope one in the western part of west thestylis the other in southern africa
957.6,964.68, the groups of people are completing at the millinery very hard on the international stage to win the location of this project
964.74,1015.2, hope to basically how that decision in about the beginning of next year but in the scheming machine i want a very much about it but basically this is a history of the universe the top of the diagram is the big bang the bottom of the digested is a big piece in the middle here which is the unknown as were we have never been with a telescope before a the ascaris designed to penetrate the unknown is designed to penetrate right back into that particular part of the history of the universe and satan machine which is ten times ten thousand times more comparable capable than machines we have to day ten thousand times which is in prettiness i figure this is our impression of video and what that telescope might look like it's not one big telescope of columned it's three thousand individual radio dishes spread out over three thousand calamities
1015.26,1018.74, a machine for doing science which is columnar
1018.83,1032.6, do signals from the universe get into these dishes they acted together by five or optics and produce the data we need to probe the distant universe as i said ten thousand times more capable anything we have to do
1032.81,1039.53, in the past every time we build a telescope it's got a bit about five times better than its predecessor this telescope tom better than a set
1040.55,1050.15, impressive so the square clumsy it's not square not a catamite is these amazing dishes spread out in the desert hopefully that there's a westmestre
1051.2,1062.36, also probably the world's biggest it project as well and if alscrip computers that's why my passion the computers comes back into this the world's largest computer is going to be a computer we need to run this particular toll
1064.49,1082.7, put in west distrait cause it's very ready a quiet in this is a very sensitive radio to receive her and so we don't want people around we don't want people make radio noise and so we don't want them around and so hopefully in twenty twenty this is what the desert of westeras can look like it's going to be the home to the world's largest scientific facility
1084.59,1113.18, before about always choosing strength this is a little plot that shows how strong australia is in some of the case since here is a college in the environment desines heminway and astronomy and space arises of the key sight of extent destroy you can see in a strongly in space in a stray actually at performs the united states european union and china in terms of the impact of the papers we produce we are very strong researched mediatory and because of the scream stronger
1113.6,1115.76, dick to the point here
1116.42,1132.56, a fashion in school i had a great teacher who taught me stuff that passion stay with me all my life and i'm sure that's true to day as it was thirty years ago and creativity you can choose a place which has excellent people because through excellent people you become excellent
1133.04,1169.28, trees i think an honest degree and once you go to an honest tore the fourth year your undergraduate in appeared these are commitments to a career in research i don't like apes if you like as not like that because a predisposed commitment it's very easy to float out of an honest degree in rapid it's a huge part of your life it's four years when you're early twenties you've got to be prepared for it mentally and physically so don't take it lightly but choose the particular care path goldollar dumpy afraid to travel don't be afraid to take risks learn new skills because astronomy is a global science don't sit
1169.34,1174.77, at home i go on one you things learn you skilled because they're all parting asides
1174.8,1185.54, and finally was back home we've got a fantastic way back on now if we can win the escape australia will be boxed front and set up one of the world's great research nations
1187.34,1230.18, thank you very much for that pater we did have some questions coming in now so i put those to you to one of the first questions we've had is what do believe by the future of space base telescopes such as hobbled that you talking about now that the nasshut fleet are about to be retired you i think there is a future in the sense that there is a utopian webb space telescope is the successor to hobble it will be launched into out three or four years time but will be completely hands off telescope and we atascosa up into a very much much higher habitan habeas it's not meant to be service does not miss be touched on its out there it's out there it's free flying its atoms and i think that's the way telescopic congo we cannot afford to go up there and so was lattine
1231.26,1232.25, and
1232.58,1259.19, a question from change what is the best guess for what dark matter actually is so the mate protect ride was looking for dark matter which was big chunks of like rocks and you know pieces of moons and you know things it will all be right we didn't find this stuff if it will isolate we would have found it was in that form the best guess for dorothee days as subatomic level material subatomic particles basically subtleties that were created in the big bang
1259.52,1266.66, so the only way you got to find them is where the police because its detector in fact the law had lodge had run clause
1266.99,1270.47, in geneva in fact give us an insight in the darker
1273.65,1306.5, i had a question actually when you show that slide about new experiment looking at darting around the black hole of a disappear into the black hole is a thing for ever saying we we see it indirectly so that stars in a stable or wardrobe italy can go around around around the ones at like have a scene some cases were dark were black holes where we know there's a black always in flashes flashes a look white and we think that is flashes a light exorcists actually dropping to the black hole right so i've seen in direct evidence of 
1308.42,1333.95, we have another question here from phil is it correct that the city project has lost funding and what your thoughts on this umslopogaas not lost bunny what happened was that there's a telescope that city was using all the allan tolstoy that telescope is lost fundament available to set any more but said he uses tilsiter the world to do such fiction and so the project continues it's just an that was 
1334.01,1347.42, probably it's best telescope they have got access to a anymore now probably look for access to the talsonian setting has been one of the very most a very active founding members of the scansion the scarab the best settlement
1349.58,1381.68, another question here your comment on the ph d that if you're doing one then you should be focused on research however there are not enough research jobs for the numbers doing pads delight to come in on this shore i think i think people may be in the past have floated us asunder does without thinking too much about it in the system as absorbed them quite rapidly i think people are a little bit more settle need to be more circumspect i think research career is a very demanding career there isn't very many jobs we know that particularly in subject like astronomy so you've got to be
1381.86,1397.04, i think the people who offering pretended to think about that i think the people who are taking on past think about that i do think my grave i think he's probably been a future many going to the system but having said that projects like a can
1397.07,1398.51, there is a broad future
1401.6,1406.4, the boundaries to the size of the universe and if so how can that be
1407.33,1413.93, adler time the question comes up and look the universe
1414.38,1472.07, hard to describe it in terms of physical analogy right well if people describe the universe like a big ball so there beach ball it's round that has a surface in so if you are the airs on the beach all you can wonder any way you like and i find an age but richling inside and the universe has some of those attributed doesn't look like a big ball of course but in edoocation attributes which are the same it doesn't have physical boundaries that we think of like a bethlehemite boundaries but this one arise and in the universe is a place in the universe where we can't see beyond its basically goes light in the the universe is the eristic lar agonies and so white travel a certain distance in the imprints seven billion years and so anything happened be further away than toinon seven billion lights we puneeree it so this in arizona the universe so the boundaries in the places where you can and cannot see in the universe tend to be set by the speed of light that the really the biggest limit if you like for the universe
1473.48,1481.28, we have another question here will be as a sea different wave lengths of light usually seen by current radio telescopes
1481.34,1498.65, his realities see radio was it sees a very broad spectrum of radio waves all the way from what we recall the man's enrooted negative a favorite if i stations all the way up into the tens of bigotry big range so from it him
1498.65,1503.3, to my offences to television frequencies and all the way up
1504.08,1515.54, very very broad range of frequencies because actually uses different technologies where different frequencies not just you saw a lot of dishes today there's also other kinds of reischach were seen very likely princess well
1518.36,1576.35, a question here about the skill that you talked about the scientist need in terms of project management and people management and communication skilloot are being covered in science to grease or is that something that how can that be addressed the lusitanian my opinion he answers no these are not being covered and in fact in westralians was estralla throating to do exactly this to incorporate into our undergraduate program some of these causes a project mauretania to people have to understand how projects were what the vocabulary is if nothing else would break down structures and deliverable and anchors and also things that are part of the language of doing science and so we have to teach a young researchers of tourandocte had at least understand these concepts because they're not going to get them out the end of the day so completely agree with the big
1576.44,1579.74, take four young researchers some of these skills
1580.67,1621.71, another question here when and how is it decided whether australia will be home for the case there is an international body of international board for the scargate international efforts over at the motheaten countries who have formed this international board that has basically the money to run the project if you like that board will be the board which decides upon the decision not sotherton of the catalan twenty twelve about february of twenty twelve a right now what's happening is that there's a international process running where the two nations are submitting to that board all the data that describes their side in all the things of the
1621.8,1648.77, and the pair and the cost of labor and all the other things that you would need to know if you're going to choose a place to build the ascertain zealand holloaing in the south african countries who are collaborating on both submitting these documents to this international process be goin in september this year an then a long adjudication process and hopefully in february early fiber will have a decision by the international council if you like of the scare
1651.68,1652.79, at
1654.23,1658.07, anyone else have any farther questions on mine there
1661.01,1728.27, has the technology of optical escapes reached an end of life and radio telescopes or the future nor infected interesting of that the very same time as were thinking about the escalante worlds also thinking about the next generation of optical telescopes the oscott there probably the last of their kind because the mirrors that the big mirror that in the belt is a single monolithic piece of optics that's about as big as you can build single muddles of optics causeth sicel strength if you like of the material if you delegate a big telescope you have to actually build a segmented nero the mirrors made of like segments like a hexagon to their oldsmith to make a big structure so the world's dothing about building a telescope based upon this segmented meriting that's going to be forty two meters in diameter scold european extremely large falcons that project is in the final phases of decision for funding i gained the serbian euro project and have stout construction in twenty fifteen but that's the future of optical strong reals going for
1729.23,1734.84, why a muslin collaborating what in for them well
1735.23,1768.65, interesting things about right telescopes the bigger thing of the bit of the so if you've got dishes spread on the ground the further you spread those dishes of part the higher the accuracy the higher the resolution of the radio images that you can make so we put dishes in australia which is three thousand clamorous we can certain resolution he put a few dishes in new zealand we got a five thousand five hundred columbine that's considerably better resolution and so putting some arrestation in new zealand is incredibly good advantage for the scars of the islanders a very pandemonium
1771.29,1772.37, at
1773.69,1814.16, i think we may have covered all of the questions that have come online if any one has any farther questions on line please place them now a petitioner points that you wanted to touch on to day no i think it's a cotton exciting as incredibly exciting time for australia and usanas this time decision of the schwere looking at a stage change in terms of our science technology future in this country in terms of opportunities as well breathed information communications technology project the world's largest computer system this telescope produces the same amount of data in a day one day let the whole planet produces in a year
1814.49,1824.12, you can imagine what a challenge to his computer technology around the world and so the careers are not just in astronomy the careers are in computer science algorithms hardware
1824.21,1828.89, formation systems detras port fiber optics so it's not just a strong
1829.73,1834.65, the one final question how many people do you think my end up with jobs
1834.71,1843.89, a project for any thing from being a race turnbull to someone who's helping bidette esprit
1844.13,1864.53, the construction we project like this probably the several hundred people for five or six hundred people would be involved just in the building of it the operation of a telescope of two or three hundred people internationally spread out various locations the international research community that tense it is probably about ten thousand scientists right so hesitate sort of scale of the numbers were talking about
1866.0,1879.26, explain i can well i think that's all the questions that have come through on line aboot thank everyone on line whose watched in takinaka and peter like to thank you very much for taking part in horripilation to day
