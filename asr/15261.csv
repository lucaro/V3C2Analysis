32.28,33.54, computer here
34.77,39.72, this film were using cannon stormers
39.72,49.98, a camera is a and our camera is a five denmark to now they both record to a solid state media in the form of compact lascars
50.82,67.05, and we are using a zooma for memory field reporter which also records to satan in the form of secure disk starts a carathis cards so to sound and both cards are immediately brought to me to be imported in the computer
67.35,77.94, so now going to import the shamefast card and the stir
78.84,81.3, and as gillian
81.45,85.71, there's the the audio and the video
85.71,90.9, i see we are organized by day were on day seven
91.32,93.87, so i'm going to make a new order here
94.17,95.94, all that
96.27,98.16, even
98.34,100.38, the cards
101.1,103.47, it is the raw for
104.37,106.2, to another folder
106.74,108.3, sound
108.63,109.65, so
109.65,114.72, we're going to take all the contents of the video card
115.41,116.73, even
117.45,119.16, put it there
119.34,120.39, about
121.02,123.33, for
127.32,136.08, now the card is imported the show organized my data as he can see it by day and each day has
136.14,140.01, the cards as well as a transported footage
140.01,142.92, different fords and a falter for sound
143.43,146.07, that's exactly what we're going to do to day
146.4,148.89, so let's get the sound
149.67,150.84, of
151.26,153.6, that is all the sound recorded
156.42,158.01, and to
158.52,159.9, even
163.53,169.2, the sound and the video clips are imported onto the hard drive
169.5,172.11, i will now go about
172.83,177.39, a city slave number both the sound and the video clips
177.54,180.15, take our first video cliff
180.87,183.33, the
184.08,190.47, and it's the first move clip these miles you can disregard their more for a few importing
190.53,198.18, your camera or using the splugen for final cut but we don't need those for with our work for
198.75,202.08, so you review it
202.41,204.15, that is
204.6,209.55, for a second the slate says this is seen ninety one
209.73,217.65, be that mean if it's for the number that means they've come up with this scene on the set and this i take to
217.8,219.06, that same
219.15,222.63, and since we are shooting with two cameras
222.63,229.02, his camera so the way we would label this is you look over here
230.16,234.45, ninety one take two 
236.85,240.48, right and now we're going to go down to the next one
241.47,245.85, ten ninety one take one a
246.06,260.19, a man on a retired in the flat and he just had to know which camera were using this is the seventy and seventy or a camera all right now that i have all my clips labeled
261.06,283.89, it is to translate the footage now the footage is recorded using the two six four code which is really good distribution coach but it is not ideal at it with a final cut you get allowed within a lot of export problems so what we're going to do is we're going to cover all this footage to apple pro risen we're going to use
284.55,288.39, princip to do that
288.48,290.67, it game
292.59,296.04, that's west so he can do more than time
296.4,299.37, and files were on the seven
307.92,311.01, and all these piles were going to
311.97,314.4, but in the bath export to quick time
316.17,318.9, and it's going to want
319.17,322.74, a destination for so what we're going to do is grown make
322.8,324.3, they even
324.39,328.23, destination order and this is carbon
332.64,335.76, so all the trans coated footage
336.12,338.16, going to go into that folder
340.02,342.81, now we got to apple proas
342.9,353.94, while under per cent and were sinking audio this so we don't need any camera sound some one do not sound and it's not arrests it ten eighty 
354.15,357.21, so unlike the inland
357.36,362.4, one now you can do simultaneous tasks 
362.58,366.39, the computers of corianton handle for a time
367.14,370.29, and right there it is going to
370.59,372.78, create all these cliffs
373.98,387.87, release it's faster i found like impressor picks out this much time to do one clip as opposed to foretime and streamlet now will that's happening he make yourself busy by doing the sound the exact same way
388.02,389.61, listen to it
390.09,403.65, and whenever you hear the slave say you just laborious heathen since though footstool transporting to a start trapping the sound in final cut
405.24,407.43, take all the sound files
408.12,410.4, i move on to
412.41,413.7, bowser
419.22,421.29, i can see

527.64,530.16, that is right words
530.4,532.47, all these colors match up
533.91,538.2, that is where the slave mark will be so we're going to put in in point
540.72,543.09, to his high light
543.24,545.25, corresponding sound clip
545.82,553.2, merged the cliffs now we've already crept all our sound within point so were discussing onisim points
553.53,555.72, we got a merger clip
556.26,558.93, i just call the same thing
560.91,568.95, and what he is
568.95,575.1, even imperator you do perfectly since up

581.88,587.61, i always give the soliveau if they want to use dialogue from a different take
588.0,591.06, and they have the sound files reliable
591.57,595.05, this going to keep doing that with a more quips
597.15,599.58, can
599.91,605.43, in point corresponding merge clips

680.97,683.49, anything happens to the card
683.67,685.17, a back up
686.58,690.66, i done backing it up i just go to the d i am older
690.75,693.54, name the camera folder
693.96,711.84, now this is a method we adopted from a simitar shame herbert the reason i do that is because once the camera crew gets the card back and puts it into the camera the camera won't be able to read the card once a says no image the camerons that i am done with the car and they are free to wipe it and usually gain
711.9,722.34, all right everything's been imported labeled an organized transported to apple progress sound saint and back up so it's rainbolt the editor for initial roughed it
