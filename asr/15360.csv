427.86,438.27, gordon heaven encumbered
438.57,441.69, i say
441.84,446.55, at
446.79,449.61, isolation
452.01,457.5, i too
459.42,566.64, to the northeast the caldigates haartebeestefontein butterplate predetermination etiennette
569.22,580.74, i am deep or textile come from the old tenement barker samuel chapter sixteen
581.07,600.33, said to san along will you mourn for saul since i've rejected him as king over israel till your horn with oil and be on your way sending you to jessie of bethlehem i have chosen one of his sons to be king but samuel said how can i go to so here's a bad atholl kill me
600.75,614.28, said take a header with you and say i have come to sacrifice to the lord and but jesse to the sacrifice and all show you what to do you are to annoy for me the one i indicate
614.97,622.98, with the lord said when he arrived at bethlehem the elders of the town trembled when they met him they asked do you come and peace
623.34,628.23, i replied yes and pete i have come to sacrifice to the lord
628.56,632.19, aourselves and come to the sacrifice with me
632.52,637.59, then he consecrated jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice
638.07,645.57, they arrived seesaw eliab and thought surely the lord's anointed stands here before the lord
646.29,652.62, so samuel do not consider his appearance for his height for i had rejected him
653.13,656.79, does not look at the things human beings look at
657.09,661.86, look at the outward appearance but the lord looks at the heart
662.4,664.74, then jesse called abinadab
664.74,667.2, i had him pass in front of samuel
667.2,671.52, but samuel said the lord has not chosen this one either
672.69,679.08, he then had shapes the sealed nor has the lord chosen this one
679.38,686.82, yes she had seven of his sons pass before samuel but single said to him the lord has not chosen these
687.42,691.32, jessie are these all the sons you have
692.25,695.94, still the youngest jessie answered his tending the sheep
696.72,701.91, said send for him we will not sit down until he arrives
702.96,705.6, he sent and had him brought in
706.14,711.54, youngest son was glowing with health and had a fine appearance enhancement features
713.16,717.18, the lord said to samuel rice and anoint him
717.54,719.43, is the one
719.79,729.48, so sang took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on this fear of the lord came on david in power
730.86,738.3, the garden is blessing to a reading and understanding of this holy word
742.62,748.83, a story is the story of god using samuel as his tool
748.86,754.05, call and to anoint david as king over israel
754.2,765.6, put the story in contact we must remember that saul the king of israel has on several occasions disobeyed god's command
765.63,773.28, god has decided that he no longer support saul as king and wants to annoint another king
773.31,783.0, in samuel the task to do exactly that samuel is afraid because even though soul has lost favor with god
783.09,794.52, the story tells us it will be twenty years more before saw is actually no longer upon the throne so make no mistake so is still king
794.55,800.13, and so is not going to be pleased if samuel the profit of god
800.19,806.52, so best friend if samuel goes off in anointment else to be king
806.58,820.14, so samuel is afraid and samuel follows god's command going to the area of bethlehem to the house of jesse who has eight sons
820.2,826.26, and samuel is to annoint from among the sons of jesse's family
826.26,830.88, the new king or the king to be over israel
831.12,833.58, and we have this wonderful story
833.61,837.6, about how samuel gods with the family
837.63,849.99, and each of the sons in turn come before samuel and jessie is has to be thrilled i mean he is a proud father and his sons are
849.99,863.4, magnificent specimens according to the story and each one has something very special to offer and yet each one god says to samuel no this is not the one
863.88,875.22, finally all seven of jesse's sons have combined but not the act not the youngest who was still in the field taking care of the sheep
875.22,881.22, david is probably only a teenager at the time the story is not clear about that
881.31,892.2, but david comes before samuel samuel is impressed but sam was impressed with the first seven
892.83,894.42, comes in
894.42,897.27, says this is the one
898.05,902.31, take the story the way it's written
902.67,904.62, he said nothing
904.98,911.25, has done nothing except walk into the room when samuel told him to do so
911.28,914.88, and david will eventually come to the throne of israel
915.24,918.51, god initiative and actions
918.63,920.31, ambitions
921.03,931.11, den all come later it's important to remember in the thesis a story first and foremost not really about david
931.35,934.89, the story about the way the god of israel
935.16,936.72, story about god
937.56,957.06, from that day on the text tells us the spirit of the lord came upon david in power i believe there are several lessons we can draw from this story of the anointing of dated first of all god's patience
957.06,966.51, god's time david was anointed king over israel on that day but david did not actually claim the throne
966.54,969.15, until about a year later
970.38,987.69, reminded in gospel stories about god's patience where seeds are planted and farmers wait and they tend their fields and they wait and they wait and finally there is a crop our time
987.78,994.95, not necessarily the same as god's time so we remember first of all but god is patient
996.45,1015.44, another important thing in the story i think absolutely vital in this story is god's call of the unlikely servant the mere child surrounded by mature adults who were smarter stronger older wiser than he was
1015.44,1021.32, and yet he is the one god calls god not only calls
1021.47,1036.41, god also blesses and empowers god enables the chosen one whenever god chooses god enable the chosen one to do what he or she might not be able to do
1036.59,1041.06, their own power and their own wisdom
1041.21,1043.97, david is the son of eight
1044.36,1048.29, whoever heard of a king with seven older brothers
1048.41,1076.25, as a severe dead that's the way number eight sons get to be king in any other story we know about is the other seven brothers have to be dead david's pedigree not the highest not the most noble family in israel we know from the way the story is told there is at least one illegal immigrant and two prostitutes in david family history so
1076.76,1103.34, not the most noble person who ever lived of course we don't know that yet but when we read the rest of the stories in scripture we know that david was a man of many sins including ruthless ambition including adultery including even murder and gone on each occasion is angry with david and god punishes david rather dramatically
1104.03,1105.83, god still
1106.25,1107.6, said
1107.6,1127.55, god continues to use david god uses channels that we don't expect god empower to be god's servants the the outsiders the weak the children the elderly god speaks to people in all languages and even people who do not have language
1128.42,1131.45, people from different nations
1131.48,1134.0, different kinds of minorities
1134.18,1138.59, calls them uses them even you and me
1138.95,1140.66, we are at our best
1141.47,1142.97, the
1143.03,1144.26, we are not
1144.26,1161.39, best yes god can be angry with us too we too can send god can be angry god can punish god can still love god can redeem and god calls us chooses us uses us again and again
1161.51,1165.2, sometimes god will take the least expected path
1165.56,1168.92, surprising path and sure enough
1169.34,1172.04, we are we find ourselves again
1172.19,1174.11, last becoming first
1174.17,1176.21, the first becoming last
1177.77,1179.6, in this lesson
1179.84,1194.15, about the way god sees in this passage of scripture the word that is translated sea in english translated chosen in english 
1194.3,1214.64, look at an english there is the use actually four different times the hebrew word raah i think it is i'm not a hebrew scholar but that bird is used for different times in this passage and it is translated variously in our english translations of sea look at and even those
1215.84,1222.23, told barry specifically when god looks at a person god
1222.38,1223.76, see
1224.27,1234.47, humans do not see we mortals look at the outward appearance god looks at the heart and when god looks at
1235.43,1237.38, it is more than seeing
1237.83,1239.69, it is discerning
1239.72,1241.88, it is understanding
1242.33,1243.86, touching
1244.49,1246.32, choosing
1246.77,1250.94, it is calling it is him power
1251.72,1253.55, god sees
1255.8,1261.5, see each and every one of us the way god saw david
1262.61,1265.52, it means more than simply look at
1265.82,1267.62, see us
1268.79,1270.17, touches us
1270.26,1271.97, understand us
1272.24,1275.15, we call 
1275.48,1277.64, powers as
1277.85,1283.04, tables us to do the very tasks gone calls us to do
1283.79,1285.62, never be so
1286.43,1287.42, for you
1287.57,1288.77, you 
1292.22,1432.14, i analogically also wielandstein aneantissement
1437.69,1446.54, some of you know that the way we create worship each week is to come together physically
1446.72,1450.23, our leadership team to create a special worship
1450.23,1466.94, you and mind but as we worship some of the physically in one place in our habenaria apples and others coming in remotely like i usually do from denver colorado and we have others from belgium and other places to
1467.48,1472.43, we come together we worship authentically and a time at the table
1472.7,1485.87, always entirely has the communion joint and we always have the bread that we share and take communion because when you share with us than at this table
1486.14,1493.19, to be authentic to our bread and what you have before you whether it's physical bread
1493.64,1495.53, in your mind
1495.68,1500.84, we ask god to bless as we come in remembrance of jesus
1501.92,1519.98, this week as we broke bread together during our worship in preparation for this time it was my turn to say the words of institution for communion and where i was i was alone in the room worshipping with our friends in indianapolis
1520.01,1523.85, in the side ahead the words and i broke the bread
1523.94,1527.72, some one on the other and broke the bread to
1527.87,1531.17, they would then share with the others and many annapolis
1531.32,1535.07, seemed like a miracle of modern technology
1535.37,1542.24, we could do this over the internet until i realized that i at this what jesus asked us to do also
1543.11,1547.01, the bread jesus broke and asked us to share
1547.79,1564.5, being broken every sunday and more time during the week in countries all over the world it has been broken over and over through the centuries success first gave these instructions
1564.53,1571.19, you see we become the hands of jesus in breaking and sharing the bread
1572.51,1574.52, break it here
1575.03,1576.29, hands
1576.32,1585.86, the bread in your mind of the illy become the hands of jesus and sharing in receiving the bread
1585.92,1591.17, now you may be in a room by yourself also taking the bread
1591.41,1598.7, or you may be with the group of loved ones or or friends strangers even breaking the bread
1598.82,1600.14, i speak
1601.52,1607.61, a case were asked to be both the hands of jesus the heart of jesus as we
1607.64,1609.98, share the bread
1610.46,1612.23, the world around us
1612.29,1615.02, her unique that may be
1615.59,1619.1, however god calls you to share that bread
1620.66,1621.83, pray
1622.97,1625.61, god we are indeed humbled
1626.45,1635.99, we are called to be your hands and your heart and chair your body your message your word the teachings of god
1636.53,1641.18, the world around us sometimes we feel so small
1641.78,1643.37, sometimes the bread
1643.46,1645.38, seems like such a small thing
1646.4,1648.65, the seed that we plant cotton
1649.52,1651.23, you to play
1652.43,1657.44, the bread was the cup that before each person here in their minds prophetically
1658.4,1660.17, each one gathered
1660.8,1664.43, help us to go out and share the sea the green
1665.6,1667.82, one with the world
1668.21,1670.01, christ namely
1670.73,1681.77, last night as jesus was eating with his friends he took a loaf of bread and after he had blessed it he broke in and said to them this is my body
1681.77,1683.12, for you
1683.54,1685.94, this in remembrance of me
1687.05,1691.25, in the same way after they had finished eating he took the cup
1695.6,1707.81, and said to them this cup is a new covenant of my blood poured out for you do this in remembrance of me for as often as she
1707.84,1709.31, of the spread
1709.34,1711.02, drink of this cup
1711.89,1716.18, lord death he told lord story until he comes again
1716.54,1717.65, to come
1717.95,1776.51, to share with us the body of christ broken for whom a cup of blessing or not for a man to ontonagon secrets
1776.84,1780.41, we approach you as we really are
1781.01,1787.16, our brokenness hardness of heart putting aside our pretence and pride
1787.85,1796.88, into the darkness that we have created and bring the light of our glory that we may worship you
1797.03,1834.86, our whole being through jesus christ to
