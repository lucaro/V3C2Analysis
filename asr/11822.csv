0.06,25.86, so are you here in my car with me a wondering mittell you why because we are going to night to go and shoot a agressor game better
25.86,61.38, the game is going to be the calculus which is the major league soccer team for you guess at dallas and new york red and the new york red falls should be a terrific game and what we're going to do here what the agenda is we will get up to the stadium i'm going to do a quick a what's in my bag type of a scenario i'm really looking forward to this time or an spend together so you say but we'll be right back and
61.56,63.15, the bara little bit
63.39,184.32, but greater wearisome gods as jeanie of the calladium the toy station here and to be quite honest this is the day after the game my plan originally as you just said the interior was for me to show up and then go on the field a kind of walk you through some of the process of me getting ready to shoot and also the kind of sit down and do what's in my bag well i overstate shot at the game but i did not plan for the fact that number one frankly i've got the attention span of a squirrel so whenever i was sitting down and trying to get through my intro and get to the what's in my bag kind of scenario i kept by getting distributional insouciant type stuff i'm not sure that me sitting down and showing you at to my bag would qualify for that i'd rather air on the side of geysering the show and trouble by just saying you know what will do the what's in my bag later come in do my job get my shot done get my shot down in to take care of that so
184.59,194.94, well that being the case you see a little bit of it a kind of what the atmosphere is or you're going to see a little bit idiot about sure where i'm in but that in the eye but 
195.03,234.78, yesterday she was the shot for a salamander game and this was an interesting one for me because in the past whenever i shoot gosport i always had my cannon seven des and obviously a long line like my seventy to two hundred which i've been using for about five years now and that i have a few other lips i take with me well you know for shooting on the fidget one they just came out pretty recently with their fifty to one forty laniston at landshut the entire forage i don't have that yet saw was left with shooting this came on the fog
234.84,323.04, and my long reach lands is the fiftysix millimetre and on this kind of created a relates in situation for me bataille you some of the image of the shot with this with this camera and i was able to successfully crop some to give me a little bit more apparent fourage in the foliage that i used on on the side for the testation so for the shooter the ex tone was the man came isaiah with me the food one hundred talents merionethshire look even though all the settings for the illiterate have twenty three millimeter available at all times around my shoulder when i had the fifty six on that camera i could pick this up and have a wider angle to be honest moving into the future i've got the rest of the season she with these guys plus i've got a couple of local colleges and i'm going to be shooting sports with and this camera just not going to cut it for that kind of stuff i'll use it for fashion for music but this obstinate also see some of the images from his camera as well in the bog posts
323.1,334.77, other lands is a brought with me i did shoot a couple of shots here with the fourteen o millimeter now with the thirty five millions
334.95,462.63, a pretty much save myself for using the much because i had the millimeter on the ex the challenge here with those though is that the tone in this situation low light lots of filament just really couldn't keep up with the action the thirty five millimeter and the fourteen millimeters ironically were much faster for me than the fifty six millimeter on the stone so when i was shooting i found that i was a lot more satisfied with the shots i was getting even then there were wide angle they weren't tight shots but these lands is cause they would lock on the focus and stay on focus faster for me i've done some subsiding around with the camera to a switch upon on on some of the way the camera focuses and so the next sports thing that i do we're going to see it that's going to help me out astonishment where i'm shooting with two stones with say a ninety that that i know that is on the fisherman may be have that ninety on their and maybe a thirty five on the other camera use that to shoot the whole game in speaking about those vocalist hundreds and i to have this freshen you're working on something like a soccer fill because the action get so far away from you but what i'm surendranath ruisdael game or a vallyble game is going to be plenty for what i need and even in those situations i found that even with the fifty six millimeter is that sometimes i'm too tied on my subjects and i need to physically back up a little bit to get the statistics everywhere so
462.66,659.76, i really got a narrow down not in a show some of this interesting i used to walk around with a low creature hundred this huge bag with two camera bodies in it seven lines as plus i had a camera with a lens on it on the outside but all kinds of garbage i took with me that i just knew that i couldn't possibly survive without well let me show you what i carry around today this right here is what i carry her off isn't a donkey journalist bag i might have that name wrong and may not be the journals but anyway i'm a correct it in the lower third or on the log post if i'm incorrect on that this this not only has my two cameras and two additional insistin a plusieurs it's all so carrying a keyboard in my paweth me so that that's quite a big change from what i used to shoot with and what gothamite phonotype the shive you eight times the charge out of a standard i panoramas one of these athanasian multi day shot and i don't know what the situation is going to be with electricity or two or three days i have a couple of these with me and then for backing up i've got the western digital my papairs hard drive this i believe is a two territories for but i've got two of these guys with me too now in the game last night what i would do as i would shoot the first have not for ozonometer what you've got is you've got two forty five minute periods and the action does not stop i mean someone would be injured on the field and less it is a you know broken bone or something they keep playing they don't stop unless someone calls the time out you know because you an official doses one assented that badly on fill you'll see a lot of times in soccer gazetted the fall down on the field and lay there in rollaround for a good two or three minutes for they get themselves back up and get themselves of the filthy continue to play so it's forty five minutes of nonsapient automatic without any intervention on my part at all will back up his cards under the hard drive for me so i know that i've got a second copy i do not delesof the car and i popped the card off put it away for safe keeping plutarchian half of the boat again in a senario where i'm on a long you know darthuil have two of these with me and in that process is duplicated no matter what i'm doing us have an alarm set on the phone and and say every four hours every six hours whatever i decided to propriate for that shoe alarming off and no matter what i'm doing i'll pop a card out stick it in here to back it up and then i'll pop that cart up put in the other hard driving back it up on the other hard drive as well just to make sure that we're safe in the back of my bag
659.79,728.19, i have got my pad this is a fourth generation pad just before they came out with the airs and it's got to see the case out of this case for backwards and folds up in the back and creates a stand for the pad fresh this is fairly important is that if i am out an airport in a hotel as sitting in the middle of a soccer field and i want to write i can set this on a flat service and i pull out my apple keyboard my buckboard and isidore on this much it's much more efficient for me the type on a physical keyboard than to use the key board on the screen here not percent of the time i'm not using a keyboard with the apparatus poisoning you know gravitating and stuff like that so i'll i'll load my pictures the the cameras are said to go ahead and automatically name the files and in a convention that i wanted to be named in strabo that but then i do my editing which all gravitates upward directly from the path
728.19,732.12, couple of other items that i have in here that are
732.12,771.84, interesting among look at you here these are interesting items will pull out a few to time and just drop them in my car as i get rid of them number one i carry around with me so i'll take landensport headphones i like these better than the apple head phones and typically whenever i'm out shooting whether it's a game like this or whether it's you know fantasticheskimi music held that so they all take landseer or pretty important
771.9,854.82, five or energy just in case you needed on a long day's shoot aspirin and an acid a never know what you're eating when you're going to eat and as he goes a long way and typically with the aspirant i'm out on a sacrifice this and i'm running up and down the field up and down stairs i'll take an aspirin right when the game is over up for i leave to minimize the amount of pain i feel the next day i think that's more an old man things than anything else was tainted to keep the lips in taking care of they'll get driver you know it charge of for the eye pad a display porch from the agitator for when i do presentations and then my stirred lightning dusty card reader pretty cool again very minimal stuff i mean this is stuff that i only need in very very very you know this is a wandering
854.82,870.0, stupid amount of scars on the probably got heroical probably two and a half three terror bites were the best tea cards there and thirty two and sixty four gig in increments a band aid one band aid can make a day 
870.06,874.56, that would be terrible if you got a blister and make it tolerable flashlight
874.77,880.41, a multi to pencil stylus
880.53,929.07, but the first for three years if they abused it twice in an extra since i cannot tell you how many pounds of locked my keys in the car but i'm on a shoe so i've learned a carrier's with me and my bag said keyser always with me and there's a passport in there too that probably needs to be renewed elnathan about it that's it man that's the bag i've got i've got a side bag over here which i will open up peroa couple of pouches on my side bag this this guy rode here holds my sarcinelli mark protest up that amusing here to shoot this with and in this bag has just a multitude of various us bicycles in it for miniatures what not so
929.1,1084.74, ah that's the bar get again this is the set up that i've kind of evolved into after shooting now corycian so ridiculously old for about you know mature for about twenty five years poor about ten it i've gone through all the kind of you know the ettinger than i need are dear that i think that i can't live without and it's nice to kind of evolve into a place where you can move from having you know these gargantuan cameras with gargantuan lines on them and you could stop and really evaluator actual needs are and in working in a mottle your footprints at benfontein back in the day when i carried that huge back pack all those lines all the tripods i mean it's it's it's almost funny to think about how much time i spent sitting on the ground switching her out as opposed to just walking in the gate cameras in my hand with a small bag around my shoulder and walking on the getting and being ready to shape rathe bad it's a whole different world so i would encourage anyone who's watching to resist the temptation of being addicted to to equipment and try to focus on limiting what you use it'll help you develop a style if you say pick one or two cameras in our iceman short off with two ends as at first i would say if you start with two at first and then move it may be if you are alone shot in the somedeal need that you don't have a life for i consider the next one and that's what it notwithstanding the the fifteen forty or i'll just get that ninety prime and then i've got my wide angle which is a fourteen or thirty five but a solicitation of oneida i'm due for the next idolater place for watching
