14.16,98.1, you do not show called mostly mary we are going through the acacias to find censorships but we also want to see the videos that you send it so if you'd like to contribute to mostly maltese call painful and seven one five five five four because it's your show mostly bower are you what are you doing in the universe what is happening around you we out here in the far reaches of our milky way among the asteroids and commons at the planets next door
98.73,140.7, the surface of the sun or right here at home twenty four thousand miles above us and go go synchronous orbit or two hundred and fifty miles in leo low earth orbit we look up to see brave and bold machines are sciences sending to other worlds and close to earth thousands of objects of our own making many of them are ours increasingly they are somebody else's they include one that captures the ancient light of distant galaxies one we inhabit others that reveal what a world really looks like on a planetary scale and hundreds of thousands of pieces of space job
141.39,150.57, ay what happens in space is changed everything about how we live and what we do most of us don't realize how heavily we depend on
150.72,203.22, the satellites just for our day to day business here in him doesn't work your fan stop working our television signal a longer comes in there are a number of things in our economy and your every day life it would stop if things in space didn't work suddenly you know we were to lose these i live a very different what we're trying through is just to make sure we know where everything is that out there olathe ancient place where hawaiians call the sun is the perfect vantage point from which to scan the sky for natural and man made objects alienation
203.61,217.32, is also the best place on earth for atmospheric scene during the day delighting is very important because we need a capability to image satellites during the daytime when their active and then when they're libby the sun
217.32,233.82, space surveillance sat on the summit of pollyooly has a suit of some of the world's most sophisticated and technologically advanced telescopes shared and operated by the air force research laboratory the air force base command and the university of hawaii institute for astronomy
234.0,251.19, some of these instruments like pan stocks the largest digital camera on earth survey the night sky faster and more accurately from the ground than any other instrument yet invented it takes images of deep space hunts earth threatening as towards it looks its satellites in go
251.19,253.59, truly wonder and
253.62,291.18, the university is doing wonderful things with it in terms of finding things seeing things that nobody's ever seen before sedate ground instruments like the advanced technology solar telescope are being built to enable astronomers to study aspects of the sun that no one has ever seen could never before have we had this big a jump in our ability to see the sun and to see the environment of the sun the last time that mankind was able to make such a jump was at the time of gallaher telescope such as as the largest and most veritate scope of the department of defense
291.48,292.8, satellites
293.55,295.77, spaceships like the former shuttle
296.13,297.06, he
297.24,299.46, international space station
299.58,308.64, ever increasing amount of new material arriving in space is probably about poison satellites that are operation to be keep track of
308.73,313.29, there are thousands more that are no longer operational
313.35,343.92, and the merriest hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris and junk that the fellow off the satellites a lot of debris and as to bremontier debris like in the asteroid belt there is all you have more it is a danger you get something traveling at twenty two thousand miles an hour even if it's very small i can do a lot of damage you think about it you could have an object a size of a bolt that condell damage a satellite and even if its large its large in the middle of you know this vast plain of emptiness
344.31,419.22, but every once in a while we know you get things to come close enough to hit each other from the recently within the last couple of years a defunct russian satellite ran into one of our communications satellites the unsmashed upon treated thousands of pieces of the bread it spread over the orbits that they were in and treated the problem since in terms of the blights leading to make sure they know renettes many objects up there the things are going to bump into each other and it can be very expensive when some of these satellites cost billions of dollars i can definitely especially if somebody decides to blow on up on purpose several years ago the chinese wanted to demonstrate that they had the capabilities
419.25,422.85, now lots of countries are putting satellites in space
422.85,493.56, they all want the same place to be an order to use the territory in space so it's becoming contested this as you might expect any land that everybody wants this gonostoma people do predict that our next war will be fought in spacertown were forever
496.71,512.52, he certainly passed as can detect the next killer asteroid killer meaning at least one definition could be that it has planted whiteman much smaller objects that can devastate
512.61,527.37, areas pretty dramatically in no eight a fifty meter as terrible in the atmosphere above tanaka russia with a force of one thousand hiroshima bombs destroying more than eight hundred and thirty square miles of forest
527.61,534.75, already identified potentially hazardous objects in space that are at least a hundred meters in size
534.81,568.17, we know that there were at least fifteen thousand more yet to be discovered we also know that the odds are one in a thousand that something large enough to wipe out a city will hit within the next one hundred years the important thing is to discover the maratha you may have a chance to do something about it there may be two areas in astronomy where mankind is directly affected by what were doing and learning the strongly one of them has to do with understanding the mere space environment and asteroids and things that may collide with the earth
568.17,571.23, there is understanding the connection of the sun to the earth
571.32,579.54, now with the advent of the test he advanced technology so lately in the house of the sun we can begin to unlock
579.63,615.39, mysteries of our local star with two thousand three ironweed there was a major solar storms called a flare and that that flare lasted for just a few seconds the energy the flux of the luminosity of expose say went up by a thousand times he had there been any any human life in space in wouldn't be alive for long we lost two satellites billancourt satellites that were unable to handle the sudden rise of energy that was coming at them from
615.45,641.13, space we lost power over sections of the swedish power group in the far north effect on radio communication was enormous claims over the polar regions were eroded because of the inability to communicate but also because of the radiation the understanding or the ability to predict when something like this will happen is really critical to making the system work
641.49,656.25, making sense of the images coming to the test daily from the sun or crunching terror bites of data the post process images of men made objects in space will require the services of the boy high performance computing center
656.28,694.44, connected to a fiber optic cable with the instruments of the summer tools like the super computer or a big part of the work that we do even with the best computers and telescopes there is one thing that the astronomers and scientists on haleakala have in common objects in space are often impossible to see hard to find and difficult to women most of what we're after is we're looking for needles in a haystack sharenhaowane
694.44,697.32, here you have these really small objects up there
697.53,712.08, and you know you have the capability to you know look at them and get an image of them see no exactly what they are so we have to try to use additional technique so one of the things that we use is adaptive optics to correct for the atmosphere
712.17,737.94, a real time correction and that to optics requires you measuring the atmosphere at that moment so you stand the laser across the sky following the satellite using it to prick the atmosphere so you can take a picture of the satellite as abashed it's pretty impressive what what you can do with with the death of optics in real time and then postponing you can extract some details that when you look at the ryan when you think
738.09,744.03, no way they can get them when information that's making something usable that wasn't visible before
744.06,768.39, today because of this extraordinary working partnership between the institute for astronomy and the air force research laboratory ayala now represents the summit of space situation awareness we can image better we know what's going on around us much better and in a fanshawe at least a small roll in seeing that the eloper the years
768.57,770.22, i love it
770.7,878.01, above it and i couldn't be a better location it's my heathenish and then and i'm more and where the big girls for beach i'm daniel downy here to tell you some beef facts the bare might is the most devastating honey bee past worldwide be keepers have been fighting it for decades often using chemicals in their hives the miseries in hawaii in two thousand seven but only on big island and wake some men show resistance to the barometer have grooming behaviours that remove mites resisted bees can help hawsepipes manage vera without chemicals so or a periogues breeding in assessing resistant bees to help manage bromides without depending on chemicals i'm daniel down for beef and till next time be well where are the big girls for be facts
880.8,883.02, our finest moments
883.62,886.11, we do not need to justify
886.32,889.83, actions we luxuriate
889.98,904.83, our spontaneously exuberant at the prospect of being alive when we are groping for reasons to live we often forget about what
904.86,916.05, should be just eminently salient on a good day every day and that's what the purpose of life is living
