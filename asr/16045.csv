0.03,7.14, i captain
7.26,160.62, i my name is charles camp my background and career as an actor a basically i've been entertaining audiences fifty seats at a time for a very long while ten plus years doing mainly sketch comedy lives ciconian hollywood various venus with baskets trooping the way i've had the pleasure of working with a lot of cool people at of cool actors and writers and directors and among them james ananias lucky enough to be able to totherhouse come shows throughout the years and i like to think in some way i earned my spot on to this cast by having shown him what i can do on stage so even though i was appointed the roll so to speak i like to think that i was somehow audition for the role throughout responsibilities great time hieratically love to have the career of say you know that men or romaninov to be known as the corean samuel l jackson that would be pretty bad as but seriously not that action my honest answer but i simply want to do good work and work with great people and have fun along the way and whatever happens happens i feel that there's definitely an art and craft to it i find a lot of cathartic release some plain rules that are close to me at heart and at the same time if there is a roll that is
160.62,163.17, quite a departure from whom i am
163.41,168.45, then i find joy in being with explorer get into skin of someone who
169.35,170.34, not
170.52,178.41, so or to try to connect and find the oneness in this seemingly different character
178.44,191.76, so it's i guess it's the joy of exploration and also just as a little bit of therapy in it not to make it sound too serious or deep but it's just this thing that i can't quite
191.85,194.07, i can't quit you
194.1,209.34, i usually get cast for kamerad very wacky that's actually one of the reasons why i really relished being able to play the character of charles in starting from scratch because i got to play
209.76,305.49, in serious moments some earnest heartfelt moments because it's it's a very sincere story so there are laughs along the way to censure but the characteristics gandhamadana be two guys on the prowl and trying to score and chicks and basically james his character is going through a really rough time in his relationship there's a lot of emotional turmoil in there but this pretty it's pretty cool there's for laughter along the way so here i am confronted with this opportunity to play such a character i usually plaintain john ill you know i play a crazy corean mam you know these are the typeface i get asked the play not the guy who has to
305.52,309.66, but you know mister you know
309.69,321.36, handsome study over here so that was definitely a tree and an absolute sheer terror for me but one that i gladly welcomed the
321.84,359.85, at these the movie i also like the fact that james as the writer director he he had that breadth of vision to sort of make that type of a call i am not saying that in a self serving fashion because i got a chance to play this his character but you know honestly it could have been that stereo typical you know machinery know could have been inhabiting but
359.91,364.77, a lot of times you know the friends that we have don't
365.07,384.45, you know we don't match up to some sort of like unrealistic hollywood set com you know look you know and there was something very genuine and authentic i think in the casting not just for like my character but for a lot of the characters in this moist every refreshing
384.45,392.01, things i love about this movie is that it doesn't have your typical sacrist hollywood ending it
392.07,400.47, it's not depressing but keeping it real and not insulting the audiences intelligence so that something i appreciate being part of
