0.06,8.58, in no be okay to day we're going to go over and climb barbilles
8.82,18.15, there's a standard way that you want to learn an exercise and i'm going to try to do that as best i can to day with this one in lombardy benches
18.54,104.22, each exercise has two things that you have to memorize one is the body posture in the other one is the mechanical pattern or the moment the body pasture is every piece of your body that doesn't move while you do the exercise and the mechanical pattern of the moment is all of your moving parts and exactly how they move there is a model for each exercise it is not debatable is based on the study of human anatomy in function and muscle function so hesperidean to that model including me vitaliano see that i'm not doing it exactly right it's just because i'm human all of our skeleton all of our skeletons are unique forereach transitions that we all are to do it to a model so if you're supposed to have your shoulders down and you see somebody hackenschmidt
104.28,123.69, the only thing in conscious contact with the bench is the back of my buttocks or hips them sitting in the crook of the bench and then across the back of my shoulders that is the only two pieces of me that are in conscious contact with the bench the rib cage does not lie on the bench or conform to the minster
123.78,132.6, so as i sat down i know that that rebate is supposed to be pushed up towards the ceiling from underneath
132.81,151.2, muscles that are on the underneath or back out o my ribcage push it up their back muscles the very muscles that push a rib caub hold your shoulders down said that's the best example of kill one bird with two sons two birds with one stone i ever heard 
151.53,156.03, this is the correct posture and that it really 
156.03,171.81, so you may remember we call this a table top and gets its name because its level when the ribcage is pushed up from underneath a upper back muscles what they would they're doing in order to push every cage up in all the silversands is there gripping
171.84,182.34, you don't have control unless you grow just like if you were only a batter to his race or a golf club you you have to commit your grip
182.43,189.54, some level in order to control the movement that now the mechanical pattern
189.99,220.71, involves what arms are going to do once we get this bar okay i can't go over that part of this exercise until i tell you how we're going to get the bar out of the rack there's just a couple of things that you have to know the indonesian
220.74,245.61, so that the bar is directly over these two bones okay so when you get there you do not let the bar sat back in the palm erika so you just a just your hands before you have that committed grip to where you feel that the bar is down
245.82,252.69, near the butt of your hand ay and the four arms before him bones a underneath bar
253.02,255.63, the
255.63,298.38, most awkward part here is to get the bar out of the wreck you know in a perfect world the bar would just magically appear above you but it doesn't do that so we do not want to strain ourselves getting the bar out or in the rack he goes for any other exercise can so very important to learn how to ideally mount or dismount that's when people strain themselves more often not the exposition you do that first thing justabout
298.92,304.11, the middle second before that moment we have to bring her elbows back
304.11,308.31, because if your elbows are back your forms are
308.67,317.67, vertically aligned rather in aneath the bar that's how they need to be to push it up okay so you do both of those
317.67,336.69, practice you fairly automatically and then when you push you push against the bench the shoulders half to be against the bit that's not natural yet to think about it and practice it what's natural is to push that far up in the shoulders come up to
336.87,338.64, that is wrong
338.67,349.17, that actually an improper use of your shoulders okay the shoulder joint was not designed a push like that so this in shoulder joined there
349.17,370.05, so the shoulders have to be stabilized down against the bench in or to push up the muscles that actually pushed the bar up or those muscles of the rib cage the ones that have committed to firmly holding that rib cage up in the shoulder down are table top level and does it change its position at all okay
370.23,396.42, so and butter the hand the milly second before a push he was come back and push the garden naturally comes over my table top kay arms are locked out there's a technically accurate term for that it's my elbows are fully extended your arms are straight the bar is balanced over me my shoulders are against the bench that is the correct
396.84,424.74, posture now the mechanical pattern is what we do with our arms we simply been and straighten them okay but how you been to straighten them help a whole lot to do this perfectly from the beginning she learned these things from the beginning and practise them from the beginning you'll always do it well you'll never have bad habits that have its are really hard to shake i'm sure you've heard that so we want the bar to lower in a vertical plane
425.04,430.86, who can the way to do that is the first of all keep our forms vertical
430.86,438.69, at that bar but to think of the elbows came in the arm without the elbows to intoning the elbows collapse
439.14,440.37, the side
440.4,452.19, the right elbow to the right and let eagle so that my arm stay right underneath the bar i look at the bottom of that bar and i lower to my table to
452.4,453.36, back
453.36,467.7, when you did that way the muscles of your rib cage to all the work that's what we're supposed to be doing it the balance at day
468.09,478.5, balance and a linen are the same thing or two sides of the same coin only if that bar
478.56,486.27, serves forward and back as its coming down is the strain on the shoulders or if they're up off the bench
486.33,513.21, so right away you can be a masterful exercise it maintain your upper body that's why we're exercising so that you maintain your upper body you know it functions fairly well when we're young adult and then it just a terracotta less you do these exercises promise no one other mistake the people to to make is on the way up
513.36,522.6, they're going to recruit those shoulders to help us in they come off the bench and the table top sake kate right away you know
522.69,531.6, because you program your brain to keep that table top up the you need deductions off your total score so here's one good one
531.6,549.03, table top table to patourel that allegories in macaulays want to fully einar straight or balanced the bar bellaver you when you're about ready to dismount more that's important
549.21,552.06, you know a string yourself in the distant back
552.24,555.36, and i slowly lord that bar
555.39,557.49, that's all we're going to do for the day
