2.55,17.76, my name's robert ray from empirical we get a ton of emails from people like you that one and a how to build the carps so i decided that we would fill one in h so you could pause go back and forth and learn how to build one of these things yourself
17.82,30.42, so we're going to build one of our eleatic bundles which is designed to be highly rugged ized it's not it doesn't have the cheapest parts in the world but it's a great bundle on a great weight learn great way to start so let's head on into the lab and take a look
31.14,35.46, the parts have more existence here
35.46,37.77, powder to i've got it on the
37.8,42.63, of cloth here to protect it from getting scratched in case we decided to cut to a cosmetic install
42.87,44.73, we've got a dual core
44.94,47.31, adam mother board
47.34,50.88, we've been very pleased with the performance on that has
50.88,53.7, for sports on the back there
53.76,57.57, sound as a sound had ernie you need to do
57.66,58.41, the
58.71,60.0, there
60.09,63.15, as a serial port he ever want to connect any
63.39,66.78, state of thematic equipment or any other type of
66.87,72.12, alice and i beg port so that's that's
72.3,75.99, great set of input output for atomic bundle
76.08,79.95, cable kid than cable its standard the power
80.13,83.58, five or for antimacassar
83.7,93.15, a connector which is going to connect with her on the other board provide also power great to the other board and then we have these three wires rather which are
93.39,100.23, ground positive in the white one is for accessory for switching accessory wire
100.62,109.14, we also jumper kid and what you use these jumpers for our setting the anathema sequences the empty either supply so before we forget
109.23,114.24, just going to go ahead and put the cellarer for standard configuration is just having on the age upper
114.48,116.31, now we've got that out of the way
117.51,120.57, disabling temti bundle
120.72,124.89, and this is a sedate automotive great hard drive very ragged
125.07,128.79, and can do all sorts of shock and temperature extremes
128.82,132.03, i told them depends that's what we use
133.5,135.87, power supply this takes
136.08,140.67, no carletons into clean regulated
141.12,145.32, outrages well as controlling ignition sensing on and off
145.56,153.45, so when you turn your car off it's going to tell the computer to turn off and a graceful man arose and causing her shutdown so that's what the entities
153.81,157.41, a memory to this case were rengetegi memories to
157.62,159.87, it's going to go on to describe
159.99,162.72, all the ports is underneath
162.72,168.18, and we're also going to have four extra sport so this case comes with
168.21,170.46, the other word comes with forest
170.46,173.19, a lot of situations where force just not enough
173.22,178.5, and using herbs can get quite unstable when you turn when you turning to computer on and off
178.59,181.56, just want the vices to work without a keyboard and put
181.74,184.98, as a lot of stability
185.01,186.18, to have
186.57,193.8, no house court and you also get a full five hundred millions of power out of each one of these things
194.31,198.0, a back lane which were going to modify and a little bit here
198.03,202.35, and a two and a half inch drive to standard
202.38,206.49, which plugs in here when we got a little bit further into the install
211.83,215.88, i think the first thing we're going to start out with here is
215.91,219.42, because we're adding these extra ports we need the mark
220.8,222.99, that plate for
224.82,228.18, the additional holes which are going to hold the sports
228.3,230.04, there
230.85,233.07, in the centre of that and
233.34,252.78, that we're going to we're going to drill these so that we have plenty of space for the sport one of the things that makes the easier when rilligious and all or some other type of sharp device to score the metal where you on to start drilling and so that's what i've done here so the back place connector is now scored with our new holes
252.9,254.97, good is quickly
255.87,257.31, these things
258.15,260.7, ahead of time i will say it a little bit of 
261.03,263.4, pushing the stuff through it rather
264.75,266.25, because you don't want a lot of
266.43,267.54, and
268.32,271.29, for dust and other things to get answers pretty
271.41,274.05, really i squeeze the
274.38,276.18, through ahead of time
277.53,279.72, the gatun
280.59,283.41, connectors on the outside
283.44,285.33, obviously of the plate this is
285.81,289.92, you can put this play on only one way got the little
289.92,293.25, here so you can only put that plate on one way
296.19,297.66, mother
298.86,300.51, there
312.75,313.53, right
314.67,316.02, now we have
320.85,322.5, reports
323.16,325.68, just the society were here for now
333.09,334.17, as
336.0,337.35, there are
338.04,344.64, on each side and three square on the back so i think i will fast forward here so that
344.67,346.98, to be bored with screw openings
347.52,348.96, expect
351.33,354.39, oriental the hard drive her
354.78,356.34, i saw the
357.81,363.84, minutes after we put the hard driving or their sports peers on the top
370.29,372.48, easiest way to do this hard drive
373.59,374.67, to
375.0,376.65, you want to make sure that
376.92,380.94, you put the connectors facing out on the side
381.09,382.59, in one here
382.65,386.61, you want the connections to you facing how so that you have plenty of room to get your cable and
386.88,389.58, and you want to use in some type of a surface
389.85,393.81, to put this on i'm going to use a spare case here you really
393.81,398.79, general wouldn't want to use one of these cases to avoid scratching but i have to have a spare one here on the bench
400.92,404.13, he rescued
404.76,406.17, the case
406.86,408.15, in the heart
408.15,409.92, time to
410.13,412.41, the porter so it to
414.15,416.49, the of course we have to put in a
420.66,424.74, connectors if he decided to use them go over eased power switch
431.13,434.49, these august to impart
435.18,437.19, other boarders very
440.52,443.79, but to get the other borne have about a milliner despair
443.85,446.4, this is one of those things receipt
446.61,448.89, to be patient
448.98,450.87, you go to install this
453.21,456.09, time make sure everything's line to
459.75,464.64, slowly rastignac and i should just horrid
468.15,471.21, so this plastic clay holds the other more out
471.45,473.19, extremely so
473.22,475.29, the first great tricky
475.47,478.92, something stronger and when he was a pilot
479.07,481.38, hold it in place
481.62,483.03, the whole line of
483.9,488.07, you can use a minister this man happens to be non magnetic
488.49,491.37, those
492.12,493.47, the hardest
494.01,496.53, because of this
497.16,503.31, to align holes in one use this printer port now to
503.43,508.77, this whole tone of the important things with using pushing on the back of these ports to
508.86,510.63, things alone there's
510.63,519.09, bunch of pines here and you really don't want to push on them they were really sensitive so you want to find something rigid cushionlike
519.42,522.36, this plastic that's actually attached to the mother or
522.57,524.19, the whole
527.19,527.91, it
528.87,531.63, too much groups
544.83,546.21, he
547.32,548.85, and on her
552.45,555.12, trenton plug in
558.51,561.09, an right now under the other boarder
561.87,564.87, no time to go on to battersby
565.2,568.38, we do this just to make threading a little bit easier
568.92,570.48, to
575.37,576.66, parables
580.17,582.81, suppose a resinous de
583.32,585.6, white which is for the switch
587.67,588.93, enter
593.22,594.45, in the black
595.62,598.41, aside
598.83,608.55, so also going to put the poor connector on right now just to avoid tiring the board this board for some reason other was designed with only two screws
609.33,618.99, that's what most cases take but it doesn't leave the lot of board a lot of support when you go to apply pressure to insult a connector so i'm going to install the radio on the bench had a time
619.17,620.19, and
620.58,623.58, that we want to install misleadest right now is
625.98,627.51, the connectors
628.8,631.08, these are polarity sensitive
631.95,634.62, some of put his own americaner
636.3,638.34, being here
638.43,639.81, in that way
641.43,643.26, needed
644.04,650.37, this case switch so we are one of the manuals which it most of the time is going to be
650.79,652.32, ignition
652.5,655.2, which is this wire
655.47,658.44, the mules which were going to have this
660.48,661.59, the 
663.06,666.39, computers of course never crash in joking course but
666.51,677.7, you could use that switch to do a power of it needed him to poise of the sand her around on fish are
678.66,680.19, through her
684.21,687.36, this first because these are here duty wires
687.42,689.55, the engage
690.87,696.57, a little bit tricky after already been put in place so
696.69,699.51, about two inches to spare it is curled up
700.41,702.6, slighted in them
703.68,706.02, we are ready to go
707.82,711.21, things that there is if you don't have a magnetic cruder
712.29,714.6, put your crew in her first
714.87,716.73, the whole so that way when you get
717.42,719.28, this line of
720.72,722.61, have to try and to use a pair of
731.04,735.09, or some other type of the rocks just to get your
735.66,737.28, splice
744.69,746.7, you have an amplifier in your car
746.91,750.39, an external amplifier and your car that you wanted to control
750.45,754.68, you would use this red pin right here to control the entire animal
754.95,759.12, so we happen to have a ten by two ettonne or here
759.18,768.06, plugged into the side of the board were not using twelve twelve penitence in its not concerning it this instant
769.98,773.88, people were told connected which provides
776.13,778.08, the mother bore
779.22,782.37, not watery thing installed
782.88,785.22, in the way
785.61,788.64, we are in the poor to give it
790.8,791.94, he
797.01,799.05, of course we have to put it in the right direction
800.46,803.31, that's why they make these things large and pure
803.97,806.7, so that's a good lesson where if you don't
806.73,811.32, you don't want to push those things into hard it should relatively easily snap in place and if it doesn't
811.47,814.32, check before you go not and
814.44,815.49, something
816.15,817.59, i can
817.86,819.39, oh these
819.51,826.38, for through it alone up so they look nice on the outside here
828.0,828.96, and
829.05,830.88, goes towards the back plate
831.3,832.98, the red wine
836.46,838.02, so we have one done
856.77,858.87, all right
859.38,864.21, for a slightly fluttered back plate but the nice thing is you have all your connectors on one spot
864.39,866.58, you can automathes
866.58,869.31, all the people come out on side of the device
870.48,874.86, so now the next step is to wrap up the cape it otto
878.49,879.93, the one
880.86,882.03, that
885.93,888.99, as for the particular so again
889.08,890.31, in
891.3,896.52, i goes over close to these headers which let you select whether it's masters they have drive
897.06,900.42, alliterative
900.69,903.51, when the parent
905.73,910.77, that in place for what we need to make sure that 
910.98,915.54, another brother boys were convolving problems later
922.23,925.26, reading
930.42,931.56, he
933.09,935.7, check everything make sure all of our connections are tight
936.6,937.65, and
939.3,941.97, we have built ourselves a corrompue
944.52,947.46, he
950.46,955.83, as soon forgets what these connectors are i just decided to take the freestaters into us as an stick em on the back and
955.95,958.02, all the ports and connectors
958.17,962.4, and everything like that strip the end now really done
