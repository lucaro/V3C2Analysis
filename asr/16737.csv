0.24,29.76, i was i was just remarking in the fore that i had the great opportunity to be on a foray for life takeoff in the united states some years ago at right outside a planned parenthood clinic in the street you know really kicking off what were all about to do which is to witness to the dignity and sanctity of human life so i'm sure that's why you're all here and i would certainly applaud you for that this work is very important this work of witnessing out in front of in front of abortion clinics
30.18,39.96, and i'm here to say i think we need to do more and the reason the reason takes me back to january
40.23,55.59, and so niners ago the battlefield in medicine was laid out before me i was a third year medical student at that time just fresh into my clinical rotations and
56.04,68.31, through you know just my basic formation in this area i was told by a well meaning family physician who was teaching me that
68.7,77.19, the college of physicians and surgeons of ontario where i was training was trying to weed out people like me from practicing family medicine
78.6,101.58, that was very encouraging of course you know and i went home with the red anthusa for practicing medicine and i had a attentions to practice family medicine which i have obviously achieved through some struggles which don't have any we don't have any time to go through all the difficulties that come directly from that statement which is
101.73,113.28, college of family physicians have on terra trying to widout doctors like me so that was what i started my clinical training on that kiss what i'm up against it it was already obvious during the
113.28,135.6, lectures where you know i might have been the only person to raise my hand and say well what about you know the life of the child in the womb or what about you know the life of somebody at the end of life what about those considerations to those were met with much enthusiasm by my clinical classmates as well
136.17,153.06, i mean what did i do to garner that kind of pushed back from a clinical preceptor right at the very start of my training only one week into the clinical portion of my training and i certainly didn't do anything other than
153.69,159.54, by by one my catholic moral philosophy but even more basically than that
159.6,189.21, what i consider to be as a new at the hippocratic oath i was blessed at queen's university to have a very good history of medicine professor who in her enthusiasm for the history of medicine found us the oldest form of the hippocratic oath that she could find the oldest translation from the greek and took us out at night with candles on to the shores of lake ontario where we could recite the oath and for me that was very meaningful but unfortunately she prefaced that with
189.99,210.75, you know if you find any parts of this so it's to be problematic to your world new basically well just this regard the host so you know the one doesn't carry much weight and i was in the very first days of medical school at the end of my clinical training there was a different oath but let me tell you that these oats are
211.74,223.26, at most optional for the students and bearing little to no semblance to the hippocratic oath and you know in our context
223.32,226.44, i'm not going to read the whole hippocratic oath but
226.62,258.51, we all might get this this sense from the basic phrase do no harm and that physicians would abide by that now nor in the oath as it used those words in combination do no harm but as a summary it's really quite good but in our context when we're talking about forty days for life an we're talking about protecting life inside the womb is very clear and it castitas will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it nor will i make suggestion to this effect
258.69,262.8, similarly i will not give a woman on a board of remedy
264.24,269.73, that's from years ago and medicine was
270.54,297.9, in a sense founded on this principle and physicians are healers and not killers and as we can see to day we've got this a very confused again so in the time of hypocrites he saying look doesn't matter if your enemy comes and pays me twice as much before you come to your appointment i'm not going to give you the poison said of the cure right that that was the basis of physicians and patience trusting one another
298.08,308.31, now the university of war on their page you look up hippocratic oath what happens in canada here we see this statement we see
308.85,358.2, university of batting other views found in the hippocratic oath such as those on abortion and surgical practice are not consistent with the beliefs of modern western secular societies and given the complexity of medicine in the twenty first century surely an ancient oath cannot possibly encompass current values therefore the significance of the hippocratic oath doesn't reside in its specific guidelines but just really as symbols of an ideal that we are going to be selfless and dedicated the preservation of human life so interestingly at one hand it says we're going to be selfless indelicate ourself to the preservation of human life and then on the other hand it saying well except for all that killing that we're going to be doing through abortion and kind of glosses over that like dis is somehow out of the context of current western values
358.53,398.79, and i would say that we really need to let these institutions now that their out of touch with what it really means to be involved in the practice of medicine and the preservation of human life macmathers goes on to say while the original oath was taken as a binding covenant to many physicians the oath is now just a nod to tradition and devoid of any influence on them in modern medical practice so this is the kind of language that used to preface the oath a today so you really getting an entire culture in medicine where there are no foundational principles for ethics unfortunately
399.09,403.41, so what are we to do
403.77,417.48, memorial university interestingly recites what is called the declaration of geneva and as my colleague was stating in his remarks related to the united nations this declaration of geneva came out
418.05,425.91, after world war i as a response to the atrocities that were committed by the nazi regime
425.97,442.65, so surely those those comments that well we have an antiquated oath we can't take it seriously should be should be dissolved through this declaration of geneva and this this state even more specifically about the
442.83,445.35, protection of human life
445.68,459.9, and i quote i will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception and even under threat i will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity
460.02,464.55, i make these promises solemnly freely and upon my honour
466.44,499.71, so for my adherence as a young physician ideologically to these principles i was told that i was going to be in a weed out from family medicine and even still more some specialties than that not just family medicine certainly the college wouldn't want to see me in obstetrics or pediatrics or deontology or palliate of care or a number of things you know so so to have myself limited by solely
500.22,523.53, hearing to both ancient and modern as on the foundation of medical ethics i just found that to be a pretty discouraging point to be in now how did we get here what was it about me that brought this attention on me and why didn't i have more respectful
523.59,527.64, physician teachers available to me
527.91,577.47, and i think that it's really because of the silence over all in the medical community about these about the departure from the foundations of medical ethics so in the generation preceding me we've had physicians say well i'm just going to keep my head down and not stir the pot too much not say anything about abortion not not be public about the fact that i don't prescribe contraceptives and just get through my training and go off on my merry way and that left a lot of physicians in positions of power that were emboldened to try to say things that would they were going to wed positions out like me so i'd like to challenge all of you out here men as physicians but as patience if your well formed in the culture of life
577.74,614.34, make sure that when your physician says something that's a deeply offensive to your genuinely and justly held believes on the dignity of sanctity of human life challenge them on that i hear many many anecdotes of contraception and abortion being pushed on patients doctors badgering them and giving them to so many difficulties i would like to see the same kind of attention that's brought on physicians like myself for our firm stand for life to be brought on these physicians who seem to have a firm stance
614.37,668.49, against life so many of you may have the idea we bathed to me in the past i'm not saying all is drugged up things against physicians from years ago but how make a complaint to the college that somebody wasn't respecting your beliefs make it obvious to those people in power that you want physicians who respect life from conception to natural death and that's what you see fit as a physician and nothing else so if i could point you in some right directions to check out a website called the hippocratic registry doom it's just hippocratic registry dotcom i can have it sent out through the forty days for life we beside that her physician such as myself who said we're going to take them the oath of hippocrates and actually hold to it you can find out who they are and there's number and canaan the numbers are growing
668.67,720.45, in addition to that certainly if your as i mentioned if you're looking for more guidance in this area i'm happy to take any request through through the diocese in the care catholic medical association about physician who may be able to guide you through the difficulties with life you know beginning of life and of life decisions that certainly through the life and family office at the dicibles don't be silent you know as you're doing this in the forty days for life remember that these things are happening because physicians have banned in their thin their honour to protect life from conception to natural death god bless you and hope i may be to see you out on the street at some point during forty days for life
