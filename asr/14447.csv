2.46,20.37, if you're singing in groups in your setting your probably using harmonies when you sing harmonies and color and texture and depth to any song but it also makes sense to know how to use them and how not to clash with other singers how to make the best of that skill
20.55,47.88, to be talking about harmonies in terms of where the melody goes and how harmonies much with that so lines of harmony lines of melody you don't need to be able to read music to do this you just need to be able to imagine where the song is going does the melody line go up that it go down does it go in jumps does it go in steps how is it working and how can your harmony fit better with that
47.94,52.59, to be demonstrated on the screen you can see exactly what we're talking about
53.76,81.51, to make sure that a singers were not always saying this is what i always sing take it or leave it i always do the low harmony i always do the high harmony i want you to be more versatile than that to be able to see where the harmonies are going and to be able to may be jump in and out to be able to sing the melody for a while and then go for a harmony after that would be much better to be versatile than to be stuck in what you have always sung
81.96,93.48, we got to talking about the lines of harmony we're going to be doing some pieces now this is ben whose joined us to day because we also going to be looking how more than one harmony joins together
93.54,99.18, so to stop with lest he some pitch exercises so ben can you play me a sea
99.36,105.15, i am going to sing a third above that a
105.51,113.19, to do that same thing again except this time i'm going to sing a third above and debora's going to sing a featherbed
113.22,118.02, a
118.41,122.19, now that i that with a different note could he place on a
122.49,127.71, a
127.71,129.57, you try that
129.69,131.16, we have the 
131.31,149.85, so hopefully you sang either the third or the first and this is what the whole court sounds like rats try that once more as evades time
155.43,159.06, now you try singing et of the third or the fifth above that day
164.28,166.71, he is how the whole court sounds
166.77,171.54, great
172.23,178.74, what on to use the song water friend i found to demonstrate how these lines of harmony work
178.89,186.39, with i'm just going to sing the melody through and you can see on the screen how this is working in terms of its line
186.63,196.68, i think benee
196.8,204.18, cousin
204.27,240.36, mantelish
248.61,265.14, so hopefully you could see how that worked with the line of the melody when i was going up step the line went up when i was going down a step the line went down and it's quite an easy way to see what's happening without being able to write it out in not for
265.62,283.92, now again a sing that song again but deborah's going to add a low harmony and as far as possible her harmony is going to follow the melody line she's not going to start suddenly singing high and if she needs to she can join the melody line but it's going to be about the same pattern
284.43,285.78, thanks be
286.53,305.82, he
305.85,342.21, the
346.26,375.15, now an to adam another harmony tomatter was doing was quite low for most girls you may be able to reach it but we're going to add a harmony so ben's going to be seen the melody and i'm going to be singing a high harmony now once again i'm going to try as far as possible to follow the line of the melody so ben will be singing what you already seen on screen and now adding another one so it's three part harmony now one melody and two harmonies
377.22,403.02, he
403.02,409.83, i 
409.83,433.23, she
436.92,460.26, if you've got a male singing the leading you've got women only singing the backing that sort of what you'll be aiming for now as you probably heard the high harmeth i was doing cut through so if you're singing high as a girl you need to make sure that you're not poring over the body else and that you just pulling back slightly on that side and overpower the melody
461.19,486.09, so now benito swap parts i'm going to sing the melody and he's going to sing the high harmony endeavors going to stanton where she was before and as you'll be able to see on the graphic the lines still more or less matchcot er and neither benares wapping over into each other's parts there making really sure that they're singing different parts and so they're not clashing
500.7,507.09, a 
507.36,513.09, i have a sure
513.93,520.35, on
520.62,527.22, jennie
527.34,539.85, she 
539.88,543.81, he
546.36,577.89, to sing the whole song all the way through i'm going to stick with the melody which is what i was seeing before and for verse one and carson i'm going to sing by myself so you can have a chance to practice your harmonies along with me then for verse too and chorus to be endeavor going to join in again and you can either sing with them or sinon harmony just try to make sure that your harmony line matches the melody line as far as possible and doesn't cross over into another line
578.85,591.21, thanks 
592.02,598.38, as the
598.65,604.44, at
