0.03,16.29, he from the earliest times we seem to have believed that the vast oceans with all their natural resources would never let us down
17.07,22.47, the ocean seemed to be unchanging immune to anything that we might do
23.7,31.98, but human activities have changed this as with all other resources the oceans are limited
33.6,39.3, the arctic is where we are observing strong evidence of ongoing climate change
39.3,43.23, a new consequence of this has been identified strongly here
44.82,61.77, arctic ocean a certification the arteries highly vulnerable to climate change already now the art agoin are warming the summer and winter ice cover a shrinking
61.92,68.46, enormous quantities of fresh water from rivers and melting eyes a pulling at the ocean surface
68.58,73.29, very basis of the system is changing
75.0,78.54, traditionally have viewed many of the changes that
78.66,81.63, i could happen to the as
82.11,86.22, stresses on maria systems on chemical systems
86.37,91.44, these have been warming freshening canes in nutrient supply
91.44,118.41, now we have an be considered the new kid on the block cancelation as humans continue to burn coal oil and gas we are changing the composition of the atmosphere the mount of seti in the atmosphere and in the surface ocean used to be in balance but this is no longer so the natural balance has been overturned
118.74,150.69, the result is a massive increase in so absorbed at the ocean surface and this is driving chemical changes that are affecting all aspects of marine life we often see that you can only push orgasm so far so you push them to the limit and then the reaction is just to crush so it instead of seeing a kind of a gradual decline in their performance of their ability to cope with changes you see that they can of just fall off the edge of a certain point
151.14,168.72, effects of these changes in living conditions extend to the very base of the food chain the plankton and soupaan at the lowest end of the food we are some of the most plentiful creatures in the sea they are also exposed to a set of vocation
168.81,172.92, entire ecosystem could be affected
173.49,208.38, sanctification is not some theory is a fact is happening now is been happening for the last time identify years we can measure it is accelerating we have a window to do something if we do at that time than the amount of governante were already releasing into the atmosphere will become even higher and the effects that we see out there already will become a reversible and we will change the ecosystem
