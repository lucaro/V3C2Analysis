156.36,157.89, it's right there
160.62,165.06, i guess she can be put to any other directory but i just threw to the root
165.33,167.13, i went to the start
168.39,171.69, and i see 
173.52,174.78, command
177.6,178.89, and
181.26,186.96, to get to the root to register this disclosed
188.04,190.65, space not that
192.27,195.66, that said my god tools so
196.86,200.22, back to use and it immortal
201.39,204.39, to do this it is i can't remember
206.85,209.37, again in every sea to the root
218.1,219.99, just take this command here
224.1,225.39, here
229.77,233.22, enter i really registered so
234.15,236.55, you shortly here
237.12,238.68, useful it is

240.48,242.58, renford
242.76,245.13, beata
245.73,248.1, systems registered and
248.31,251.1, where one more step away from
251.22,253.26, the
254.43,256.83, with him all the apes

284.04,286.02, and the
286.47,288.33, corneck
290.58,292.38, our windows
296.13,299.7, and i on seven so i'll just
299.82,301.59, even at the moment
303.66,305.55, and there is
312.21,315.48, screen capture at the same time something in
318.09,321.48, so it is you need this
321.84,325.56, and i proceed to download
327.66,328.95, and
329.16,329.97, in
329.97,334.08, stone
338.13,339.51, and 
339.6,343.14, one file for my five de market
344.13,345.54, disraeli
346.2,347.49, quick out
349.08,350.61, and here we go
351.06,367.2, there's the moth die a sweet and ripe adulterations and such ernestine to right to there is your virtue directory i'm working on an artist on my last
368.31,372.54, quite fast i recommend using the very fastness
372.96,377.61, at zero with normal spindle drives or necessity
378.45,379.71, right so
380.19,383.01, i can see that it's made her ideas all
384.36,387.09, is the information
387.57,392.7, meditate if you want a wish of the file so your
393.09,395.43, so is quickly upon
396.06,396.93, he 
398.91,401.94, all are in windows
402.6,404.22, all is
405.3,406.74, is our audio
410.07,411.63, to show you
412.38,418.95, the ideal thurstane ordinaries per second
423.69,427.17, and of course it gives you the right method
433.29,434.13, he
435.48,439.29, and so he has credence because you get all this information here
439.74,442.68, the proper to the exposure
442.89,446.58, it so alice 
448.38,451.08, and the review
453.24,455.7, that's the white
458.58,461.94, i see program named amelia
462.81,464.85, besides and compressed
465.24,472.65, yes it is compressed this is terseness there is some compressed his something
473.07,475.68, locations out there at the moment this is not let
476.58,479.88, and as it shows the proper method
481.11,482.4, a nice
483.75,485.46, and ah there
486.39,498.0, so you still have some now you have the same flexibility as on the man with opiates will will import properly into soul
498.6,500.73, and also open up
500.79,502.17, resolved
504.66,506.07, still have 
507.72,509.4, the latest twelve
520.95,522.33, there are
522.54,524.61, and
527.31,529.71, so it completely
536.52,538.17, thereat
553.98,555.93, and
556.05,557.85, he wanted
559.65,562.62, yeah that's how correct
562.98,565.89, a level so as football not
566.04,567.63, and
567.63,569.13, still
571.08,572.13, okay
573.72,575.85, and
582.51,586.44, then it is i
597.69,598.8, do
602.22,604.26, it's an audio there
606.27,608.91, that la
616.2,617.31, say
619.65,626.73, no i can quit quick but chuck your file quickly
626.76,631.62, you don't need to run another up on the program to you know
633.18,634.41, for a
637.74,639.24, so that is one way
639.81,641.76, then from there you can take these
641.94,643.17, resolve
643.41,644.91, prepare
645.3,646.5, and
646.62,648.99, and
652.5,655.56, the 
658.83,660.06, here again
662.22,665.55, it is in the rag video process
667.26,671.28, the derbices and moves
674.31,676.11, the other thing i want to talk about
676.23,677.52, i
679.05,681.45, to get away 
681.51,688.38, what a cry to get away from the dull commanding work for altogether of
689.73,692.07, and this fellow here he
692.7,694.86, star
694.89,699.6, fellow has written a program for c called 
700.02,704.52, producer for windows seems quite popular
706.35,708.15, read on read
709.17,709.95, and
709.98,713.28, is basically what it is
714.3,715.65, also program
716.46,718.05, see what he's done
718.17,720.51, is taking
721.8,723.96, program to produce
725.91,727.74, a file
728.34,732.57, impress him to bideford
733.14,737.34, its image sequence or even
739.26,742.89, convince him to put in a cinnamon being
742.92,746.4, export on that too so bring you standin
747.87,750.21, he used different every
750.51,753.51, he is quite
753.87,758.07, extensive littell in development
758.31,761.34, i would say it's the tool to 
761.97,764.13, it is portable or to the men
764.97,767.22, for a video
769.29,771.9, so that's what it is
772.14,773.04, and
773.94,776.1, here some of the things that
781.05,782.94, the
784.05,789.63, the old devotion one that stable i suggest
790.32,795.9, the latest with all the sending export and all the latest
796.26,797.52, it
797.97,801.0, the video orosin
802.32,809.34, processing and leprous appendicitis ikenield imagine should be pretty soon
811.11,814.44, so here on
814.65,816.72, three 
817.44,819.21, the latest bill
819.93,821.67, it's in a drop box
823.29,825.27, and it is built
826.26,830.55, that's the latest one that at the cinnaminta
830.91,832.74, export on a two
837.09,840.96, here there are sitting generator
841.08,846.0, embassies or for ideals
846.96,848.82, your excitable
849.48,850.74, and
851.64,857.22, where you're out is you can change you can show you where you can change the output
857.58,859.02, a default to
863.61,864.99, let
866.97,868.26, right here it is
868.92,873.87, well just hold a first all old 
880.59,882.18, to a desk
884.04,886.17, and when still mounted
886.53,889.35, so one raw
894.51,897.66, but sir this the two civil
898.92,902.22, see here father victor
902.85,904.65, i 
904.89,909.51, in entire
912.69,918.03, there now we can read too much of things but
918.33,920.37, construct this new
922.2,923.82, the
924.84,926.52, for
927.3,928.2, very
929.34,931.05, so you have
931.47,934.89, there
937.2,940.23, but in the right color space whatever you like
940.35,943.8, and wilbour films as the
945.99,948.42, these
948.9,949.74, and
949.89,953.7, i see this program doing very well as you can export 
953.85,955.68, as to 
955.74,959.31, to wide gamut with the twenty twenty rockface
959.67,965.34, and you get a lot we follow the work with in a compressed form if you wish
966.06,968.64, the evening
968.64,969.78, et cetera
969.9,973.14, i usually leave it 
975.09,976.56, adjustment
979.68,982.38, then came correction
984.78,990.27, temperature or preserve lights out white temper
991.56,992.61, but 
1002.66,1007.16, so it really rivals the 
1007.67,1008.63, just
1008.72,1011.54, really gives you full
1012.17,1013.37, with
1014.03,1015.86, with the raw
1016.64,1018.05, now
1018.08,1020.48, that a celebrated monitor but
1030.17,1033.47, it up and then cartoonist ground there
1035.66,1038.72, so now you get some filters
1039.05,1041.51, so you got some noise reduction
1043.52,1046.25, so this is where
1046.25,1047.6, people need
1049.16,1050.18, there
1050.51,1053.57, to get good noise reduction is a 
1053.9,1057.83, an after effect sir otho
1058.25,1061.16, to obey i guess
1062.69,1065.36, the resolve which has
1065.42,1068.48, and so now
1068.48,1071.3, there is a part for
1071.45,1074.96, i don't retreat
1077.66,1078.74, in
1079.79,1082.43, i outwear
1097.13,1099.32, catherine same time so
1100.31,1103.43, the course you have curves to also
1103.85,1105.47, his real
1106.4,1107.63, video
1110.93,1112.1, to
1112.61,1114.32, to get all the bugs out of it
1115.25,1118.82, i believe there's a new version coming out here rates
1120.98,1122.54, and
1124.43,1126.32, it'll be 
1128.39,1129.53, now
1130.82,1137.33, i thought and of course with the auto that the idea ardea
1137.66,1139.22, then you have your
1141.26,1142.22, like
1142.34,1144.98, different exports
1145.4,1148.43, this is all
1148.49,1149.78, and 
1151.31,1155.15, progress for for for if the magnetism
1155.24,1158.48, if it's the apple one it would be 
1160.97,1163.01, our raw
1163.16,1166.58, the frog or deflated so with compressed
1167.6,1172.4, he came a bit
1172.7,1175.55, and interested
1175.67,1177.14, deflated
1177.8,1180.53, so you know i take that
1180.65,1181.88, a
1183.98,1185.21, that
1185.66,1188.84, image and continue on you mary
1189.8,1191.66, make a compressed file
1193.79,1196.7, this nation
1197.63,1199.1, crease hopefully
1201.38,1203.66, a ete
1204.62,1205.79, and
1205.79,1210.11, can explore this all yourself to so i disparage you aware of everything
