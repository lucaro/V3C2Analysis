346.53,347.55, he
360.39,363.75, around two hours of walking through the wilderness
364.17,367.29, finally reaches his destination
376.14,379.38, while cooking the familiar waters and landscape
379.53,382.29, in his preparations to fish
384.63,435.51, the animate pulls out a handmaid twenty foot long tapered line out of his bag 
435.69,447.57, a typical tin gadara is around two and a half feet long then that's a bartholemy rod i'm using to day is
447.69,464.07, i say the taper of the rod i using the day is pretty standard for modern tangaras not sure if every one would understand what i mean by a six to four action
464.07,468.18, it's the but to dip racial
468.21,474.9, the line i use i make them myself i make them out of aniline
474.96,480.03, i twist lines with varying diameters together to create a taper
480.12,489.39, the line itself is actually pretty heavy the line i will use to day is about twenty feet long
489.63,500.79, i started by twisting two sets of fur a line together each said this one thick line furled together with three thinner lines
501.18,507.66, so the but section of the taper starts with eight lines
507.81,510.69, i make my line
510.84,525.24, as for my fly the din for this fly is the fur of a furrow between calls my in japan the hackle is from a peasant i personally don't use many patterns
525.27,536.07, these are the only patterns i carry with me i have one with a black body i have some with a florescent hornby
536.67,551.97, these have a fluorescent yellow body i only use these four patterns besides the sin my kitty cimetiere other patterns
555.21,559.92, but it seemed my leader is about twenty seven inches long
560.16,563.1, i think that's about all along it is
564.45,646.98, is it a small river so even if i using a long line i'll keep the leader short for better control smothering has begun statistics
646.98,659.55, eetionia is a small one up
660.09,699.63, these hardy fish thrive even in these mountains that see the heaviest snow fall in japan
702.93,710.31, we wondered when did use it at the wise man of the mountain come to begin the cura
712.92,725.73, to gwen did i began dematous it all started when i moved from tokyo to anomia for work
726.06,731.94, it was a re location for my job that had me move there 
732.0,734.13, was there and wooden
734.19,757.32, i met this successor of the neat hostile encore grandfather of this man was a master at ten careni have been to witness him fishing they were fishing for yaaaih the locals would refer to as hero
757.89,763.86, everyone called the yam and i was told there were a lot of them in those parts
764.4,772.71, ask them if they could take me fishing for them and they took me siccative fish that day
772.71,784.62, there were lots of yama a back then they were all pretty big too we didn't have a nice fire pit like this
784.71,788.07, and a fire in the half of an oil drum
788.88,792.63, in the vision the fire and roasted them
794.22,797.31, we were talking around the camp fire
797.58,800.85, where the subject of grace
802.02,804.81, told me that caraway
805.32,808.77, said you just swing a rod to catch a fish
809.01,812.79, so i thought i should try it if it's that easy
813.33,823.02, that was when ten car began for me i'd say that was really the first step on this path of life
823.02,833.37, that's how it started for me it's already been fifty some years since then
835.62,854.37, i say the reason i've been doing it so long is because it's fun there are many reasons that i find it fun as you know damaris a traditional method of fishing in japan where we use a fly called the cabot
854.46,863.67, it's a traditional method but i came up with my own ideas through trial and there and added them to my technique
864.12,886.5, along the line i was somehow recognized as a true tintagel by the successor of the nicole i can still clearer my first fish in truth i had caught fish several times by chance i had caught fish before but it was in my second season i didn't through skill
886.53,892.47, it was not until my second year after taking up an cara
892.47,904.89, i still remember my excitement when i hooked that fish my encounter with that yama remained with me as a vivid memory
905.16,911.1, it was thanks to that fish 
911.34,919.68, i i can't bear it has already been almost fifty five years since that day
919.74,929.01, even after that many years have not grown tired of it and have yet to scamp a single season and a sense
929.25,932.55, a life changing experience for me
934.56,940.53, so far civitas had only one catch
940.77,943.83, fish are not keen on taking his fly today
944.97,946.17, regardless
946.32,949.56, continues making his way up the river
965.04,968.43, the fish don't seem to be out to the
969.0,975.96, as the day reaches in civita decides to sit down and have lunch
975.96,981.99, he
982.26,991.83, his lunch is some home made rice balls with a few indices
992.4,996.12, quenches thirst he drinks from the river
998.67,1011.21, aforrado mesa with me to dip cucumbers and pickles in the mesa is here with me in my bag
1011.93,1016.73, seems argot to pack the cucumbers and pickles themselves
1019.22,1022.7, he can't complain when you're hungry
1022.88,1028.4, how's the case may i am hungry
1028.43,1031.73, anything taste good when you're hungry
1031.73,1034.94, i will make it back on an empty stomach
1035.42,1040.19, oh well
1041.87,1043.82, he
1046.76,1049.67, he
1056.03,1058.07, he
1061.01,1063.77, the
1084.29,1102.98, he oenothera beautiful yanatas come to meet seated
1106.97,1119.51, semites love for the rivers and nature found here in the adumbration of louise runs deeply
1120.26,1133.85, this region called adam is especial place to be the divarsion is particularly remarkable even within fuschia
1134.06,1138.95, the old go in a glisten deep in its true to the name
1139.49,1142.58, place is very deep in the mountains
1143.6,1148.52, the west there is also the ancient gold mountains
1148.82,1159.41, the rivers that run from there are wonderful the first time i experienced this place was back in nineteen sixty one
1159.65,1163.19, i was years old
1163.73,1167.24, when i first said foot in isis
1168.47,1172.13, almost seems like yesterday
1172.19,1183.47, in a wink of an eye over fifty four years have passed since then what i really enjoy about the admiration is the rich nature found here
1183.47,1197.87, there is an abundance of wild mehetable and several species and that there are also lots of mushrooms here i don't think there is a single native species of mushroom can find here
1198.35,1215.99, think you can find every kind of wild vegetables and murther the course even if they are abundant and never take more than for one meal i only take enough for myself well
1215.99,1222.44, i may take a bit more when i have friends come to visit me but i turn okee it only what i need
1223.76,1254.36, i hope to continue doing this until the end of my days but one can only wish as we all know it is something that we cannot escape i just had a recent incident where i broke my hip and it has become weak it prevents me from moving around as actively as i was able to can't cover as much ground my food any more
1254.66,1267.17, i do find it a bit unfortunate because i can't be out in the mountains as long as he used to but these things are inevitable
1267.38,1304.58, yes these are things that come with age but i don't let my mind dwell on such things because that would make me to breast i tried to stay in a place like this or its relatively easy for me to go out i make sure that i don't lose that opportunity i don't know how much longer i'll be able to do it either way going out into the wilderness as for i just like to enjoy it for as long as i can
