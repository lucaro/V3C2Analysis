3.06,6.21, avoiding moments winter a moment
8.19,11.79, i would expect to start work on
12.99,22.62, i've been working on this project for almost a year now and it's been full time and it's been so funded from savings
22.65,26.07, i didn't imagine when i started that it was going to be
26.37,28.32, a year long project
29.07,32.4, before that year i was free lancing
34.35,41.61, but i'm working on his cold pickett's a kind of book reader
41.82,48.87, books there is an awkward thing about setting it up and my experience in roman
49.08,54.9, running some workshops was that it's really beneficial if i help people
54.93,71.76, a handhold them through the process of getting up and running with the sufferer of developed so the idea was that i would be physically available in berlin to meet belisarius and get a few of them
72.03,74.67, and running with the soft way
77.46,88.47, as a very small bag i make that a boat to travel with and i have
88.56,93.12, it is aboard which allows me to
93.72,97.41, some flexibility in choosing good posture
99.45,102.15, while miss
104.04,109.83, i started at my place so i was working on the couch at home for about an hour
112.65,117.69, he had borne to a low care for another hour
119.88,126.42, feel to be uncomfortable in cafes if i'm there for more than an hour or an 
128.52,169.68, i know i've got my lap open dark unify it even just go to the toilet at the packed all up and i don't drink more than one cup of coffee a day sir can i do feel like i can sit there and subsist for two long hooting cup of coffee but i also like to get up and walk around about every hour sassinate that it's good if i can get up and move at something that i know is palomita part of my process when i'm at home and i'm stuck on something to go for a walk is very helpful
182.73,191.28, so then after the caecam here and it was another hour and then there was some lunch so as another opportunity for a break
195.48,219.18, someone will come around and say so or milor something an it's just the opportunity to chat about other things and i guess cause when i come in in the morning it doesn't seem appropriate to interrupting us work and have a conversation with some so lunch time is the opportunity to do that
221.55,234.33, this project is that because i've a sort of ranged across a bunch of different suffered apologies and his project some haring tomatter in a way that i
234.9,236.37, i think
236.76,238.98, probably a unusual
239.82,249.18, mostly those i choose to the work that that feels the most interesting to me 
249.42,251.13, tends to be
251.34,259.5, but the projects that have come up that i chose to work on a
259.65,268.68, me to learn you take ologies i think i was on the eve ostentation to put all his paces together because i was exposed to
268.71,270.87, such a broad range of
271.14,274.74, things in recent craters
