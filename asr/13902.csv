51.09,57.6, using the cane fed mark too but this information is good for other cameras as well first you'll want to change the mode of shooting
57.6,68.07, you don't want your aperture changing during the shot you want to with your camera to em or manuel mode and the previous version of the trial i said it was a v but has pointed out manuel is the best choice
68.13,100.68, reason we switched to manuel mode is to keep the death of field consistent throughout the entire shoe or else her photos won't march as well if at all during the her process since the death of field would change in every shot which is a very bad thing by switching the manual mode the bracing system were going to use will only change the shutter speed of the camera leaving aperture alone to whatever we set it that which so exactly will we want next to one as at the camera tricotine shooting is tombent another camera so do what ye need to do in your camera to get it to shoot continuously on the top writer the canon by the elstree you'll see a button mark a drive
100.89,107.19, internal large wheel on the back of the camera in spectators like three raking in their boxes stuck on to each other
107.55,121.62, take multiple photos in a row with just one click pershing to click each individual photo the reason we do this is because he fotis need to be a back to back succession of photos or else should be left licentiates that change why you were clicking away
122.22,124.53, also necessary for me time
124.74,128.55, come to the most important part to sitting at the camera the bracketing
128.79,136.53, and not to put a fiscal bracketing button on their lower imposture cameras you have to go into the menu system and changing activate this setting
136.89,138.81, press the man blood
139.95,172.68, then using the top colwell worked away or the lion with a camera two squares and a red background is the second one from the left next using the big wheel in the back scolloped and selected using the centre button a large wheel the city automatic exposure bracing system whether in the menu system using the top row wheel click over one notch to enable bracketing interessante line of bracketing intervals of pierotto ones as well as your exposure numbers jumping from negative to plus two to negative for
173.01,180.54, if ahriman to remember that you need at least three photos to make an h composition you could use two but i probably wouldn't turn out so well
180.72,184.08, rarely going to be shooting three frames for our sequence
184.2,189.75, negative to one zero and on a plus to the skinning us a wide and anagram for shooting
189.75,193.44, shooting something incredibly brighter day may want to slide the bracing system
193.68,199.77, to the left of the right using the big wheel after rotated the top at least once to reveal the bracing intervals
200.16,205.65, he in turn the wheel five times to the right said the exposure at negative to zero and plus to
205.8,212.4, that's too much for what you're shooting can't the appropriate stoppage perhaps you'll need negative one or plunderers
212.4,215.79, it's going to vary depending on what your subject is and how it's 
215.94,233.58, after with that make sure you press the center or a button on the back big wheel to accept the setting if you don't do this the camera won't bracket which totally defeat of purpose of what we're trying to do it's also important to know that once you with your camera of the sitting is going to be removed from memory and have to say that all over again on your camera is back on
233.67,239.76, to set your wife balance to whatever situation your sting abashing outdoors all choose the outdoor sunsetting
239.76,246.21, important not to use the auto white balance because this can change your composition as well as that flicker of your time was
246.21,274.5, once you said the white balance your cameras ready to go i will go ahead and move on to setting up your remote time so first make sure your time has a delay long an interval setting on it the long and interesting are definitely a must middleton is basically account down for your time when the star buttons pressed is is gielow you to situate your remote an move away from your camera next is the long setting which is the most important setting this is going to set the number of francaria during each interval

279.12,289.65, to set their remote to take three photos by selecting set and moving the letter all the way to the right and slighting the second spot increase the duration to three seconds which will quit the three shots
290.79,294.51, last more than three brackets you can increase the second spot
294.57,297.51, correlating number to achieve those extra brackets
297.96,307.23, after that set me to the interval setting and select the designated time between frames that you want since i'm capturing fairly slow moving clouds also the interval the six seconds
309.78,321.27, next year the option of setting the number of trains we want to capture cochose whichever number you like just remember that thirty frames equal one second of footage if your compositions based on a twenty mile point nine seven framer
322.02,337.98, before you begin shooting make sure you're shooting on the correct quality format for the best age dearest shoot on raw but just remember it's conquer a lot more competing power to put your composition together if you want a good faster way to compile you images should on larger medium a peg
338.01,340.83, definitely be happy when it comes to render time
341.31,345.96, after you've set your intervals and the picture quality your register her time was
348.18,355.35, in part two i'll show you had a merger each dear time left into a work of art using a tarpon and adopter effects
