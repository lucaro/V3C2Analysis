2.46,21.33, i'm dan and i'm doing todcaster balanced body where my studio nor start plates and buffone york and this is nancy and then she's got to be demonstrating for us a fitness or sometimes exercises also known as laggards tempting arts or legs circles some one have nancy laid down on her back
22.68,34.62, and just as right there from it so when you have your athlete lay on their form or getting into their former kind of you know important you want to make sure they do it safely so i'm going to have an anti just push with her one of her legs it doesn't matter which one
34.68,37.8, going to grab a strap and hook it around the free leg
38.34,44.19, and just holding that leg in place she can take the opposite light off the bar and hook that foot into the trap as well
44.94,52.32, so she is in one piece and everybody safe so the exercise again is called fenestras
52.32,61.5, and sometimes again it's referred to is like art or a leg circles someone have nancy just start by inhaling as she brings her life up to the feeling
62.1,63.93, alan pressing down
64.23,138.33, over looking for here again it's just create a little bit of it mobility so if you have athletes who are pretty muscular and tend to be tight in the hips this is a great exercise is to help loosen up hips looseness and is also nice one a kind of work on some lodestone sort of the wanness of where the knees and feet and relation to the hips so what we're looking for here is a nice smooth steady movement and i just want to make sure that the person is aware of their dominos and coarse ability as well so as the lights press down we want an exhale with a nice abdominal contraction to keep the riphaean pelicon then in halfont hips a come back up so this is the basic exercise flection extension of the hip and we can go into different variations as well so nanette your hips out into external rotation and prostrate up annowre so again just maintaining that same connection of inertia or we just externally rotate the hips to create a little bit more openness to the hips so with athletes again they need to have a combination of movements available to them at their hips so sometimes flexion extension with rotation or flection tension with rotation external or ittin internal so i should rotate and to internal rotation for men
138.33,140.37, press up and down for me here
140.94,146.16, so just looking again for nice balanced movement speed up and down
146.37,153.09, then making sure that the admiral the stable and that had taken shoulder the nice and soft on the carriage
153.75,164.91, another variation to work on a little bit more hit mobility is quite the top for me and we're going to go in circles so keep the feet in parallel the whole time and you going to press down and circle around to the top
165.33,177.03, this just again broadens the amount of range emotion you get at the head and some are more flexible another so you can start for the smaller circle and then work wider as the athlete becomes more comfortable with their hypenation
177.36,196.26, i shoot you take a nice wide circle from his white as your hips feel comfortable going good and you can see you can go pretty wide depending on the range of motion of the individual you're working with so this is a great exercise for a gymnast exercise for dancers as well as those of athletes that you're working with and just reverse direction for me
198.54,223.17, and there are a multitude of variations you can do at this particular exercise a single a variations you can go with increased spring decrease bring tension depending on what you're aiming for with the particular exercise good to spend both knees for me now and let's rotate hips eating toes out heels staithe good snowcrust going with a slight diamond or frog position of the legs and which is going to examine the legs nice along
223.29,236.64, keeping that turn out ben the need and come back in so just a simple life press in extenuation or fraud press just again working on hypenation lord tremaine and coarse ability on the same exercise
238.11,240.45, one more one more repetition there
240.96,242.58, and press
242.82,250.92, and paul's there now coming out of their former same way so ben both nestor me won't you take your right leg out a loop and is put that foot on the bar
253.32,270.87, and then just lawyers self on the barotse that knee and take that foot out a loop and come on down good and that's a fenestras hamstring arts on the reformer with some variations i hope you enjoyed and hankowitches
