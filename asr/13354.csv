528.81,538.41, a huge privilege to share the stage over the weekend with some amazing human rights activist from around the world including of course a number of my own colleagues
538.47,544.02, it's great to see friends and supporters of human rights were from here and uncertain in the audience
544.83,553.92, i do all know the fame of this human rights we can is the idea of close to home stories and topics in europe
553.92,555.54, close to our boys
556.02,569.16, as a european living in new york city i loved to tell my american friends just how much more sophisticated we europeans are when it comes to so many critical issues a human rights importance
569.55,571.38, gun control
571.47,573.93, the use of the death penalty
574.05,575.91, to health care
576.0,577.59, a sex marriage
578.01,588.18, but the reality is that we are in a human rights which are kept in fact very busy working on human rights issues here in various parts of europe
588.96,599.34, as you saw in the film russia is experiencing the worst crack down on human rights since the end of the soviet union more than twenty years ago
599.7,605.43, hundreds of non governmental organizations face hostile government scrutiny
606.0,612.36, is adopted laws restricting typewrites and freedom of expression
612.45,614.52, fringing the right to privacy
615.09,621.96, and even the release of high profile prisoners such as michelet rosky and the members of pursuit
622.35,626.22, not significantly indeed at all like the crack down
627.51,640.05, it deeply disappointing to human rights watch struck the netherlands will be represented at the opening of the social mixin russia next week with its high level delegation ever
640.5,641.61, king
641.64,642.69, queen
642.84,644.1, prime minister
644.49,656.76, the opening cerinthe olympics is a big deal for president put and the attendance of dutch pipes symbolizes indorsement of rushes oppressive policies
656.76,659.37, including oppression about people
659.55,665.67, we urged the prime minister to speak out against government repression in russia
665.88,669.96, well as about russia's hugely damaging role in syria
670.11,672.03, some outcome to in the few minutes
673.17,687.09, still in europe just to day new crane we spoke out against police beatings of and shootings at does of journalists and medical workers while they were trying to disperse protests in kiev
687.66,695.7, in many of these cases the police deliberately targeted journalists and medics who were not participating in the protests
696.69,703.17, even close to home here in western europe we've seen the rise of extremest parties in several countries
703.44,711.72, which use strong anti immigrant rhetoric to promote intolerance and even violence in discrimination against minorities
712.02,717.0, grant refugees muslims roma and jews
717.39,724.32, in grace human rights watches documented races vigilance attacks against migrants and refugees
724.89,728.55, rovere expelled from france last year
728.91,732.84, and in hungary we've seen growing authoritarianism
733.05,735.0, utility
737.37,741.96, yet perhaps the biggest stain on the conscience of europe
742.11,744.0, simplices
744.33,749.88, we've documented policies that directly contribute to death at sea
749.94,757.17, thousands of desperate people fleeing poverty and violence in africa the middle eastern elsewhere
757.23,759.6, seek safety and security
759.81,761.58, a sense of home
761.79,763.53, here within our borders
763.8,771.69, just ten days ago twelve women and children refugees from violence and the pression in syria and afghanistan
771.72,777.63, drown when the boat was forcibly pushed back by the greek coast guard
778.26,797.91, we've also found terrible detention conditions for refugees migrants the sylum seeks in bulgaria ukraine greece turkey and malta as victims of violence and repression from syria libya we lanahan istan and other countries in safety and security
798.69,801.45, and here in the netherlands
801.66,810.45, we wrote in our world report which we released just last week concerns about immigration and asylum policy persist
810.78,819.06, in june the un committee against torture express concerns about immigration detention the treatment of unaccompanied children
819.09,821.79, conditions and treatment in detention
823.02,828.33, but as i think about the work of human rights watching ninety countries around the world
828.39,848.28, and the challenges and the issues that drive our four hundred staff day in and day out to document and bring attention to human rights violations and to seek justice for those violations i'm struck ever more by the fact that our notion and orontes anding of close to home
848.34,849.42, involving
849.93,851.28, once i mean
851.43,854.25, twenty years ago this month
854.46,859.89, jane romola who was the head of the new peace keeping operation in ronda
859.92,864.66, send a now famous facts to you and headquarters in new york
865.41,871.2, that fact he wants that that was a potential genocide brewing in and
871.62,875.7, and as we all know now his warning was not heeded
876.0,879.75, international response was too late too late
879.87,882.99, and people died as a result
883.38,888.75, wanda was just too small and too insignificant a country
889.26,890.97, too far from home
891.84,907.8, people to mobilize the necessary response and as hard as we and many others tried we didn't have the instant images nor the mobilizing capacity that technology to day now provides to galvanize the necessary response to save lives
909.06,919.32, to day we live in an interconnected world where even the farthest country and the smallest country and the most politically insignificant country
919.56,922.92, a sweet or a mouse click away
923.28,927.66, we can no longer claim that we don't know what is happening
927.66,932.76, no home can be abeam or paris or geneva or athens
932.79,934.29, the borders of your
934.68,947.61, but close to home can also reflect the capacity of journalists and human rights activists and humanitarian organizations to make us all aware of humanitarian human suffering
947.76,949.47, in togoland
949.62,954.18, and to remind us all of our obligations as global citizens
955.26,960.33, he and write what is currently focused on two major crises in africa
960.72,972.3, essential republic and sound sudan both very poor countries devastated by political crises master trustees ethnic violence
972.42,974.67, massive humanitarian need
975.18,979.05, these are countries that could not be further from home
979.11,986.7, graphically economically culturally socially politically for us as we sit here a night in this beautiful setting
987.03,996.12, but by bringing the situation these countries to international attention and by urging it a national support to protect life and new suffering
996.15,1005.96, we all help to strengthen the idea the closest home is not just a physical concept but one that goes to the essence of bishamon
1006.86,1012.53, i understanding of inter connectedness and bringing human rights issues close to home is not
1012.65,1016.28, limited to our work on conflict in mass atrocities
1016.73,1030.02, human rights thirstingly focuses on poverty and economic development and the way in which human rights protections are central to just and sustainable economic development and efforts to address poverty
1030.14,1042.29, in the film you saw my colleague ethereal about the world that we did in mozambique to address the behavior of multinational corporations working there who were violating the rights of some of the most
1042.5,1048.59, the osnomians in resettlement programs in the context of coal mining
1048.92,1069.95, to morrow for those of you here in our panellings will be looking at the conduct of international corporations in different parts of the world producing goods for citizens and yet different countries we will i am sure talk about the obligations of companies and governments but also about our obligations as consumers
1070.19,1071.18, here
1071.3,1072.68, the
1072.71,1075.14, do what we can and we must
1075.17,1078.47, for more ethical action and human rights protection
1079.37,1084.26, of course the extraordinary technological advances
1084.26,1091.13, the human rights at and many others to bring close to home stories around the world
1091.58,1096.59, technological advances which enabled activists who drove the arab spring
1096.8,1100.1, advances also have their dark side
1100.22,1108.65, thanks to edward snowdon we learned this year the ways in which technology has enabled unfettered surveillance worldwide
1108.83,1111.65, shipping what's peleg protection exists
1111.95,1118.46, we learned that george a well be brother a stand by a totalitarian regime
1118.67,1121.16, i also operating in washington d c
1121.4,1129.5, national security agency is watching and gathering data from millions of us americans and not americans are like
1129.59,1133.88, most of us as totally inadequate oversight
1134.06,1135.92, broader survey
1136.1,1138.86, proved in secrets of courts
1139.37,1151.31, clare that privacy laws passed before the internet before mobile phones existence provide very dubious and inadequate protection in twenty thirteen
1151.64,1156.95, government obviously have a duty to protect national security and to prevent crime
1157.01,1163.07, that does not give them a free pass to monitor the communications of millions of people
1163.13,1164.93, and no suspicion
1165.92,1169.49, the national security agency all the mass
1169.52,1174.53, prothoe but in that case it's a trend we have to resist
1175.64,1178.85, i want to and talking about syria
1179.18,1184.85, as the most critical and challenging human rights and humanitarian crisis
1184.94,1194.9, the world to day in a few minutes you'll see a short stem about our work there you'll have an opportunity to hear from our amazing series archeleuta
1195.08,1199.4, but i we just say a few words about just how vast
1199.43,1202.88, human rights and humanitarian crisis syria is today
1202.91,1205.37, i must materials
1206.3,1215.24, i staggering well over a hundred thousand people killed nearly two and a half million refugees who have left the country
1215.36,1219.23, six million or so this place within the borders of syria
1219.32,1224.96, the cording to the un nearly million people in need of humanitarian assistance
1226.13,1231.11, human rights at home documented deliberate attacks on civilians
1231.14,1242.63, of indiscriminate weapons as you saw in the film including of course chemical weapons torture executions disappearances rape detentions on the vast scale
1243.14,1248.09, governments and rebel forces have been guilty of gruesome adjusts
1248.84,1254.96, and yet despite serious deliberate policy of waging war by killing civilians
1255.26,1258.29, as well as increasing abuses by rebel groups
1259.58,1263.81, the international response has not been as strong as it should be
1264.38,1271.28, not being nearly enough pressure from world leaders to end the trustees or hold perpetrators to account
1272.54,1282.2, what does that mean a closet a home well two thoughts tessie need more intensive engaged pressure from european governments on syria
1282.32,1283.7, russia
1283.79,1285.29, chief in abram
1285.8,1293.9, we've seen too little action to unlock humanitarian assistance which has been denied to hundreds of thousands of people
1294.56,1306.23, seen no arms in bargains the syrian government and we've seen no repeal of the situation to the international criminal court so that those responsible for a chance can begin to face justice
1306.92,1310.91, he talks in geneva where not even able to agree
1310.97,1316.43, allowing soon through to the starving children of your book in the south of the masks
1317.42,1327.23, after the awful chemical weapons attack in august of last year and got which killed well a resounding civilians many of them child and silenter pajamas
1327.32,1335.0, as an international revulsion which created an agreement to destroy syria's chemical weapons
1335.36,1342.65, but the more conventional weapons which have killed far far far more civilians than that
1342.86,1344.06, not being stopped
1345.62,1348.35, and they look at the refugee situation
1348.47,1354.65, those desperate sons some sort of home even temporary where they can live in peace and security
1355.1,1360.08, i already spoke of seven women and children who drowned off the greek coast last week
1361.07,1368.57, and he half million seven refugees at present mostly in the neighboring countries of lebanon iraq jordan and turkey
1369.95,1373.37, how many of these refugees have been accepted in europe
1374.36,1376.85, in fact the incitement
1377.15,1379.37, thirty in spain
1379.82,1381.47, in france
1381.74,1383.81, in germany
1384.44,1387.65, just here in the atlas
1388.28,1389.81, a million
1389.93,1405.98, as you watched the short but very powerful son about human rights what is work in syria which will come up now a cimitry to show how we uncover atrocities and tell the story of admissions caught up in this dreadful conflict
1406.28,1411.2, think about what it means to bring human rights close to home
1411.5,1414.44, the responsibility to each and every one of us
1414.56,1418.16, citizens in this global and into connected world
1418.28,1420.74, to make the dream a reality
1420.8,1429.38, eaton
1442.19,1818.66, nonancourt watch interviewed people who had been detained during the recent protests some of them at sixteen and seventeen described to the group which syrian security forces did to the electrocution with with with cattle boosting be hung right horseback on papers read lines and hospitals in the north of the country and to walk inseverable to document adduces the opposition and we have first only condemned as abuses engineering temptations sharpshooters in the amelioration retaliations of the village potentates the government forces on the program militaer husband and two sons and execute them meaning was extremely barfordshire haartebeestefontein telephoned assentingly what she had seen that day allowed us to reconstruct many many details that otherwise would not have been documented that one anatole us that the soldiers will entered her own had a sooperior on their arm and this information is confirmed by video footage film by t v stations close to the syrian government that were on the outskirts of idea that interviewed the regular soldiers as well as members identified themselves as national defense forces our role is to cut through the fog of war and to say these are the perpetrators it takes time in the case of my diet to us two and a half months to find enough witnesses from enough neighborhoods to be able to say we have enough pieces of the puzzle that we are certain of the information we have and then had once justice she wanted her story to be told and by telling their story by telling it in a way that the facts are not disputed you shift the burden on the perpetrators there's one thing is clear people will remember by the now
1818.99,2262.24, i want to ask you some questions about the attack on your house realisation openheartedness violently different magnitudes hebenstreit rothieden manual so we contacted the activist insight syria and we asked them to take fotografia fallow the different components of this bar meeting posted them on a specialized network we have developed consisting of military experts and weapons identification experts from around the world to ask them to help us identify the weapons identifying and reconstructing the weapons ostentation mental importance because these are very large rocket systems they have never been seen in the hands of opposition biters and they will be very difficult to hide our investigation and the kids that but the one forty millimetres and the three hundred and thirty millimeter rockets used in the attack were in the stock piles of the syrian regime we have to transfer records to prove them and we also have videos of them being fired by syrian soldiers during this conflict carry out this horrific attack the un weapons inspectors already in damascus ought surely to be well placed to find out but maybe not their mandate is to establish if chemical attacks have taken place not to name the guilty uninvestigated were not allowed to sign responsibility for the attack but they left important clues and the report they were able to look at the rockets on the ground and established the trajectory the direction from which the rocket came to enumerate watched to the trajectories and mapped them out we were able to establish that they were fired from government controlled as appointed another finger of responsibility directly to the sarrasin feminine for syrian government forces were almost certainly responsible for the vagueness and that the weapons great nerve agent was delivered during their tactical designed rocket delivery systems hoosemaid watches too is not only to name and shame the abuses but also to name and shame the supporters of the abuses we need to put maximum pressure on the backs of the syrian regime to end the abuses security think about me are you going to indiscriminating civilians in eleanor's to the international criminal court yet you know of course you know what you trust the security council the stage because of the russian veterinary to support the version of events of the syrian regime we immediately responded with an article pointing out the misinformation that put in was paddling the lies and half drew it was one of the most reprinted papeterie were as ever written even if russia wanted to continue to deny that syria was responsible the fact were now established enemies on friday the fifteen members accurate counsel tediously on the deal put forward by the us and russia the passing of this resolution breaks at two and a half year dead log at the noisy where least hundred thousand people have been killed wasson for the comical person cut it helped changed to international momentum towards holding a sadly countable and for the first time a sad was forced to take action but taking one estimable on the ground establishing those responsible for these atrocities and ultimately building the momentum with need to stop the killing and syria
2268.15,2309.4, yes women he pressed movie good evening for all you again when i was excrutiating i saw this moving now for the fourth time or so and i'm it seems every time or more you get even more impressed by the work of human apocant the huge problem you for helping to save a mayoralty was this was your face wasn't it slopes agave her hand because she saw in the movie seizing the wonderful work and as the syrian living in research and he in peasant cause i have some
2310.09,2313.48, questions about your speech to now
2313.48,2344.74, about minutes or so to go through the sugar work and it's far too short of course just so let's to insects just to get an impression as i said i'm a journalist and we need these facts there stores you could say and i can also limonite movie strutting through the forest and the 
2346.66,2367.81, so what does my daily job like so much of the day is spent so were based in ver most of the serial work is happening from our buried office and being based in which is hostile syrian figuration we get a lot of people that come by the office
2367.9,2385.09, refugees the have relatives that are detained inside syria or having problems settling into lebanon there looking for some one who will hear their case document these that have been perpetrated against them
2385.15,2389.41, sometimes just listen to what they're dealing with
2389.83,2392.86, and of course we spent a lot of time in the field
2393.13,2409.3, going to the areas where refugees live and all of the neighboring countries to document abuses perpetrated against them inside syria by both sides of the conflict as well as to hear from them their protection the
2409.3,2420.37, and then of course we traveled syria and you know why would someone you know take the risks that we take when we go to syria
2420.76,2428.56, in the video you see i with my college where in a home in the takane's an air strike you can hear it
2428.65,2444.85, side to see to see what's happening that same day we went to a small village in attacking collegian we were there documenting aerial attacks and specifically the use of cluster munitions by the syrian government
2445.09,2457.45, and a cluster strike had just happened earlier in the day so we were there to see the munitions to take photos in to to speak to witnesses and while we were there the helicopter came back
2457.78,2461.47, and you have
2461.5,2484.15, for the people that are living there and instantaneous reaction you know you want to seek cover but you know really there's nowhere that you can go that you are going to be safe and so we went into this half constructed home and sort of pause together me my colleague the geographer that was with us and children from from the neighborhood
2484.39,2493.3, this moment of anticipation what's going to happen and there's a complete sense of helplessness
2493.3,2502.78, your waiting for this helicopter to drop a bomb it made you may be lucky or you may not be lucky and there is nothing we could do
2505.75,2527.74, the bomb dropped and it actually fell near to us but it didn't explode and afterwards we finished conducting our investigation on the questions and we left the area but for me the significance of that day was despite feeling that helplessness the people that we spoke to
2527.83,2530.62, a sense of hope in that
2530.92,2539.8, they were delivering a message to us that we would then deliver to the united nations to the russians to people that actually could do something
2540.1,2561.52, help them so i think those are the moments that motivate me to do the work but we do and you say you're taking one case at a time is ontogenesis of the puzzle together how do you know the sources you're talking to are the ones you
2562.42,2600.22, so our methodology requires that we always go back to the witness the victim began first hand information about attacks that have happened about violations that have occurred and then we build a picture of abuse so we don't just rely on one person statement about an execution or about a chemical weapons attack we look at video evidence photographic evidence sacraments by other people that were present to try to fill the picture actors
2600.52,2601.93, how do you know the
2601.99,2608.23, were you whether you're safe on a surprise that you were suddenly in a very unsafe
2608.53,2612.1, an when the helicoptic
2612.25,2627.94, so we do take very serious security precautions before we conduct trips into syria and we did know that we were operating in an area where there were real attacks the attacks or happening
2628.51,2645.19, at a frequency with which we felt you know we could manage the risk and we could take concrete steps to minimize our risk in terms of what time of day we were traveling to areas how much time we spent in areas making sure we checked
2645.64,2662.05, we know that there is a risk and we take measured risks when we believe that the information we are going to gather we need it to present a case for an egregious right of use that is happening on the ground
2662.17,2670.36, and you called syria that most critical humanitarian prices to day
2670.6,2684.43, how difficult is it to keep to keep it on the agenda the insolent like today we saw well pursuits are coming to holland everyone here outside in a couple of minutes or maybe even now to see the movie
2684.64,2707.89, so then the lines are on russia again how what your strategy to keep syria on the agenda especially as the solution that we want international is not coming as quickly as we want it's a good question and it's a huge challenge i mean love described our role very well just now when she talked about
2707.95,2729.61, conversations with the people on the ground who are coming and seeing our sis people who can take their stories to the attention of some of the most powerful and influential people in the world to track to try and do something and not you know clearly as what would look to do in syria and southern
2729.91,2733.72, very fleeting attention span
2734.17,2783.67, even a more information is out there people's ability to focus on one issue is often very very short there's a sense of helplessness and timandra have to work hard to keep syria on the public and international and pracontal information to reminding people that this is not something to be forgotten just because you haven't heard about it for a week but everything
