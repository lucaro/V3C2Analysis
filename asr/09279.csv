1.92,3.96, so this is 
4.17,18.24, i forgot my mom which was actually an idea of this to me by my man who is like you know just to comment on them to how they was years ago how how you know is going down hill but this is probably the most untamable
18.24,23.55, that we had a lot of people who are in the show and any other place 
23.55,40.47, artistic and indentured hostages one of the shortest
42.66,50.7, in the haste joke that makes this whole show thee this all like minute worthwhile as functionaries face
51.21,62.4, and i would love to obviously see a show called imitator shows my momentary would have to be set reflective enough to be worth the watch i guess
62.55,69.54, he actually lost all the pottage of that so that's pretty much the wrong cut and i just added title that i like that was the regret much you just saw
69.69,73.5, for the final only had the rough side and head
73.77,79.29, my bedroom at the time and this 
80.46,91.53, i don't know i just now i guess he just you know it's like someone was making a like my dad dad joe or whatever and i just thought it was kind of ified
92.04,95.64, maybe it was like right next to himself who your dad 
95.88,99.36, whatever but anyways i kind of put it together and i thought it would be funny and
100.95,105.18, quick this is like one of the quick little i call this a transition sketch is like
105.39,108.57, maybe seconds max
109.41,116.31, the whole or bompart like was not written by me someone else suggested that and i decided that you know
116.4,119.1, a lot of humorous it is
119.19,121.38, worth while especially in a comedy
122.43,125.73, here comes the producer again
126.15,128.1, general statement on
128.67,132.57, hollywood in general and missus kind of what you see
132.69,136.77, hollywood he is because the
137.58,141.0, the as you're going to see one that
141.0,145.47, so intricate and has so many times thought into it that it couldn't
145.56,151.38, it would be like like spider man three with all its villas and stuff it was just by too much
151.44,154.26, for a sketch and the sketch that
154.29,158.64, and i wanted it to be like her they're going to try to catch the indo
158.91,166.92, they're going to get to a point where it's going to not make sense instead of not make sense so much that they just cut back to the acting iterating what is going on
167.22,170.37, the whole sketch pretty much and it doesn't make sense
170.46,174.99, it doesn't really resolve and then you cut back and drops it
175.02,176.4, for the rest of the show
176.49,191.61, and then your life essentially without a finality even though this was the following to play with the premise a little bit and actually make a sketch that fit with the promise that i i think i did it all right but this sketch was the night mare
192.27,194.34, i guess for the first part i'll just
194.4,197.7, on explaining the whole
198.15,200.76, story and then for the second part of the
202.2,203.94, the nightmare was
205.2,211.02, i love this movie but this movement through so many
211.23,212.7, changes
212.7,215.82, it and just one
217.05,219.51, just terrible but all got too that after this 
221.22,222.99, so here's andy again
223.05,225.3, she's great she's as some
226.47,242.22, basically this is filled in my friend bailey's room and really quickly and this is just the into that kind of is like giving them the prelude to other samantha was not put there by me that was just but thereby i think the 
242.49,244.98, when they were moving in
245.64,252.75, basically so what you're hearing here is that the whole campus is dry and
253.83,259.5, that no one has read and that they don't know it's going on and they are not going to happen
259.5,263.76, from here we're going to go to the town seen that was
263.85,267.72, do that by mattie who directed this whole
268.02,273.12, this is the big one at like the man she also did our entity which i did not mention
273.12,275.28, very first sketch but
275.31,277.98, the very first one and essentially the very last one
279.93,284.28, the polygon to realize that he has the main dealer of
285.81,290.55, as has this new type of weed called superpower coach that gives you superpowers
291.0,294.93, so so we have solicitors and so obvious or because of the
295.17,298.86, lack of what every one is turned in his overstocking for me
299.04,305.61, the heat supercargo here's the town they have this new type of lethaliter couch
305.79,309.93, there get a smoke the super power couch and turn and go into
311.88,323.4, you know it's going to be this like musical number basically right after that they get attacked by jones people looking for weed and then we split off not in the godwinsson and followed
324.33,334.74, pairs of characters through the whole story of the of the film up until the very pole so basically you go from point like from that getting chased
336.36,345.33, almost dead and in go all the way evidently follow say michael kept and michael certiorate first and you're going to see that one in this part
346.14,349.62, and then after that instinct all the way back to the attack
349.65,351.57, so it followed
351.6,352.8, and
354.03,366.12, do and stony island and then you're going to go all the way to the climax and then you're going to jump back again and follow garter and he and his twin tales
366.6,367.95, the whole plot
368.25,380.55, the one they all beat up there going to have the final so that i mean that's kind of essentially happening and i think that that reads at least but there are definitely some plot to take and
380.55,388.02, but what we went through i mean there had to be put to states like i'm surprised that any form of film was able to come out of this
388.32,397.35, with how much she deliathis is another song written its odd this is actually just only that tenderfut it was made for a enone
399.27,410.49, at all these bands are sober studio that i've mentioned pretty much all of them anything that to do it that i know are slavery studios which is the fire
410.97,412.2, so
412.77,415.11, the laboratory
416.31,419.28, just start the story now because i guess
419.58,421.05, big might
421.32,423.96, michael curtis in the red buoy
424.29,456.54, one of the nicest people i ever met but in between this so this whole sequence was filled this opening outside sequence was filmed in the first semester that we were filling the sketch show and all of the rest of it everything that ottilie after this to play our wistful the following semester and in between these semesters michael curtis for no reason i'm not getting for no reason and no evidence of any reason to manifest he got fame from campus
456.66,465.6, i mean that i could not fill to him if the location that i was meant to so so oh a lot of this
465.84,467.31, that were filling
467.46,493.83, right here so he was not allowed to be here he was not allowed to be here and a lot of this was filled when security was monologising so we had to light at their retirement hide him in a room with low him in a room and just pretend like he wasn't in there he would just be in there alone and we would be filling bolshie nothing because we couldn't progress as we needed him but he couldn't be seen by security because of besahi
493.92,495.12, in
495.24,497.79, a formal the police
499.23,516.48, no reason because other than that he is a big black guy i guess it he was no threat to any one i am a bigger threat to people that had so there were times when we are filling that and we have watch but age of certain things because we had to keep tillinghast going
516.54,529.68, security you know they're bored it's like a small art school is not so happening is not violent people are stored in you know whatever but that it had so they would homethrust watch us and we could not fill with big might while they were there
530.19,533.94, what happened was that the end of his production
534.54,537.48, a shooting this night shooting rather
537.48,542.37, the end what real rapping they came in and they stuck it sir
543.18,547.47, this was the first of the reach of the second
547.83,551.13, erotion after we've shot all the outside stuff that
551.16,553.68, prior this was the first day
554.52,557.19, there was still footnoted with it
557.22,560.01, and basically they caught me
560.16,567.27, called this terrible person who let me think what eliot's name was peter remain
568.5,573.36, terrible person to a horrible horrible man and he really was upset
574.38,579.18, very very very hot it was bad it was really bad
580.98,586.74, i resume talk a little bit more of the themes and this reliefe get on to that so basically there like
587.01,590.13, the super powers are very ironic so
590.19,597.81, for example the twins they close their dacenter each other but they cannot tell afore anything else about their clothes
597.84,604.2, that doesn't read very well the movie obviously michael peps extra mission dorking with his glasses
604.29,606.63, the explained pretty well and that
606.69,609.66, he can read minds but it's in french
609.87,621.75, so basically all of these super powers always superpowers don't work except for leaneth only one that couldn't make sense to work because it's photosynthesis
622.14,632.4, so this is the end of this is about to be the climax right as they start running down the hall and that is the end of the first part of this sketch and the fourth part of
632.43,634.38, come come get
634.47,634.98, back
