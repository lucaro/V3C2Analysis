0.15,15.69, teetered on the canienga senorita on companies for the last few years to try and improve the online sales
15.75,20.13, the biggest chance i've had all this time it's just how much choice these guys offer
20.25,29.07, initially started working with them i said gus there's too much choice here does just too many products he got to read this book by barry shorts the paradox of choice
29.1,33.75, sure loads of you familiar with it all for those who aren't let me just give you a high level
34.05,40.02, i say is that if you ask any one if choice is a good thing you invariably get upon of the response
40.26,45.99, all these ideas of freedom of control and autonomy wrapped up in them and everybody wants that
46.32,51.0, the reality of choice is actually something different were bombarded with the constantly
51.21,64.17, go down to my local taste store and that's why i'm bisonette's probably for sixty different types of butter and with that much choice i can't choose i can't make a decision with that most choice people actually walk away and they don't buy
64.53,67.14, this is the power of the book
67.38,74.82, say they want choice they say choice is great and yet in reality the behavior says something else
75.18,83.04, like the research proves that to the last choice offered the more yourself and this just feels like such a relevant learning for telephone companies
83.04,89.97, on the other store that was full of one it was so full of thorns there was different ones for fashion yes for us dialectics
90.0,96.84, the difference between the seat the idea is just too much choice there
96.93,99.15, response to that we've built a pass like this
99.39,104.61, the home page click on bones you see the foremost popular phones would be by no boots
104.64,108.33, rejoice in feeling so the sails are going to come in
108.48,111.39, in reality this page utterly fails
111.45,121.77, people care about this page is this all phones putting down at the bottom they're gone to buy one these ponds later because they are the most foremost popular phones but at this point they won't make that decision
122.25,127.71, we spend ages trying to figure out why this page failed and the reasons it's failed is fundamentally due to trust
128.1,137.37, no one actually trusts the company to show them the form of popular ones so that pays by their just make them feel limited and controlled and
137.49,144.12, people might surge a too much choice if they feel like choices being aristotle that not interested
144.33,173.19, trusting actually isn't just for elecampane it's pretty much for all big business i tried to think of a big irish company when he was come in here that of that i would say i trust you so much you make the decision for me and i couldn't think of any man going to do in the example from small business this time this guy is calling harman he is to time irish briston to time forth in the world brisacier of three ecossaise but when you go into consolato see actually is quite a limited manu
173.22,190.8, only get three options here and yet this time the imitation in choice doesn't feel bad that first like a good thing this man feels curate particularly for you and so it's like brings up all these things because of the trust that you haven't colonisation you happy to go with that
191.13,216.3, this brings up the ideas of trust and control in the relationship between them we've seen from the examples that when you have no trust trying to reduce choice just as a work and that's the position that a lot of our businesses are in not a big businesses just can't would use just a conchie because the locust criticas just would be such a mass of effort so what do they do they see choice to the customer allowed them to control and when you get here is this
216.63,223.5, real the real real sort of cotton we know that more choice reduces sales
223.56,229.8, for big business all time that's all i can do and for us is designers we got a live with it
229.8,232.35, there's a lot of choice there we've got to deal with it
232.77,238.83, the real world for big companies like this he walk into one of their stores and you see a human being
238.86,244.11, understand what you're asking for they can reduce to a choice to a level for you can actually make a decision
244.41,256.2, from one don't have that human contact so here's three real quick learning for what we found for a lot of choice one get people to the product listing page that's where they footoor able that's where they'll buy from
256.35,261.51, the filtering this page is really important that's the way they're going to narrow the choice to make a decision
261.78,275.37, the trying be an open and as a your designs as possible this is signed that we did all about recommending products but the beauty of it is that it sets in the paralysing page so when you get a recommendation i can compare it against all the others
276.15,287.82, to be honest i think on lines got to help a lot of work to do if i mind was a sales guy i think he looked like one of these duets here on lines got to do way more helping the customer to manage this level of trust
288.36,292.23, and choices and going anywhere we got a live
292.68,304.35, this is the challenge in the town they put to all designers here we got to find better ways to manage this level of trust to find designs that work well and regards to be moral eat more clever and more trusty
304.38,315.96, by reason
