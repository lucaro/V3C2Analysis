0.0,10.2, welcome to the global health and nutrition network innovation spotlight series part of the supply side global experience program
10.62,179.19, in this episode we traveled to bangor india visiting farms labs and factories to document how subvention in similes are applying a farm definite ingredient process to bring innovative ingredients to market joneses we travel about five hours south of bangalore to explore the field of salem in experience of a gathering of more than two hundred farmers fighting against synthetic kuruman we will also sit down with one of our industries pioneers and see first hand the riband manufacturing process and action rosolama and spices facilities to day were at submission but also one of the great innovators in our industry first i wanted to start at the beginning or doctor mohammed mignon the importance of working with the farmers who are responsible for growing the crops that enables seventeen the highest quality naturally greens to the market herefordshire the watering together never going to get less than that absolute market goes up they share in the day have third compelling for us to learn directly from doctor machine how seventeen samians had built these guarantees in for the farmers this is something new to us and seems to be a big differentiator for the farmer and doctor virgins business as relearned about this and more in articus one or the canon the road and see some of these farms for ourselves so we got in the car and made a five hour journey to the south and what we saw left a humbled and inspired so hereaway to sailing a couple of hours ago and were on our way to go see the goerner the kuruman comes from the terrified wretches we arrived in sailing were surprised to find the so called small gathering of farmers

444.84,916.62, curious to get deeper on this so i asked treatise a few more minutes with me discussing how this ingredient is impacting the market so shockingly for callythorpe of force cinch is your brand an ingredient for slain not the primary benefit the primary people reason that people use it is for lenorman which i think is interesting because in the industry weight losses been a huge sunario long time the most weight loss though we see rearsight heavy stimulants out there forelooker the true benefit of foreloupers its almost antedate type of stimulate is no superiority but you can still get a kick and get the lean body messines it's wait manistique the totally different kinds of weight mantras all from right here in the field right natural grown right here in salem here in india a indianapolis of people to bring what the us market wants which is a way to get landmannschaft but right here in the fields that year with me today he had all started hernersfiord the end of the bay we end up for the great product on the market that not only is a marked success but a telligence way as they search for these weight management solution attracts in the forms that you went on to day heathenish formula that contains foremost now do so as we consider this spectrum that she and mentions it made me want to learn more about the orindges and the manufacturing process of gossoons on this topic and also had a chance to twosome of these working areas in both the radiant in the manufacturing facilities godmanchester of any such a fossilised to no comparison satinalia you can survive for a few years but banderillo at it it is indeed punished and not a man and continuous must penetrate element but is what apaian again say that i have made malachite astonished and i continued to see in the forsyte that we will bring him bannerdale the market from all ornamented to day jan the part might be brought atoned weibertreue down the line on the oath last by years is now going to pleading into the market a short in the continues it is situated a orosin composition a mere no substitute for it threw out the tournament i got the chance to speak with a number of petty scientists who are responsible for applying their intelligence the innovation coming out of the last this is no small feat as hundreds of doctors collaborate together the estate of the yard technology to test and define and redefine the finished ingredients that impact the health and well ness of the world i wanted to get doctor meditating about investment here as well especially looking at the equipment that you have in the einstein solicitant haven't seen in it a lot of other places and that a major investment as how onaparte the nuclear magnetic residence which he manasarowar too to have a against very common in the industry and investment onomasticon that the become mainmortable you that boston we need to know if the speyside all her interests if they used it easily in the limits so that is unlimited lately the last couple of years calaboose must be guarding with the planters we need to know what kind of comminuting attendant is there with her manufactories but none in the norrises as we look at hollis investments or being put to work for salads and to ventilate a trip to elemental to get an over view of the fermentation process for growing the actor robotic ingredients and also dispense in time in the biotech nolo centered learning about supercritical carbon dioxide extraction as we continue our journey here in india to day whereat the simulate centre where we have two facilities to operations right here on these beautiful grounds at first wigginton process that produces the lactarian has brought to market and second rate herons for going to tour the super critical so extraction facility where the doing cutting edge extracts of botanical slatina we can learn loathsomeness nature will be learning the cuttenclips as soon super critical fluid extraction is the production of standardized extracts from medicinal herbs by super critical carbon dioxid extraction a very clean and green process where the carbonades that is used is recycled forres and contained in a closed lutist this is a huge investment from samanean eventide built this level of technology and automation in interesting to see the investments doctor mainspring to light through this innovative facility
916.8,986.22, joined the team in the control room to learn more basically this is michigan trolleycar often of operations and the elaeothesium all veneering and loading of the material as well really need the physical alderson to commemorate that completely automated completely inclosed in all run for river as we continued our tour of this fascinating facility we were able to see the results of the extraction process whatever expression arearea in satis is footpaths supercritical stepaside consecrated to venture hectorspruit is notorious like a plant in the field restoration to the final stop on our journey we had to the same ancient blusterin and coleman facility
