6.99,58.38, people ask me why i started the divorce her and i have to say there wasn't one catalytic event that brought me here yes i was about to go through a divorce so i will say that the idea of a business around a borough despite the fact that i was getting to horse was not something i really ever imagined it truly walked into the bank one day and saw my girlfriend who had already been through a divorce trying to get her life organized so that she could run the administrative side of her life herself and she was in the bank at that moment trying to open a bank account and get a credit card and unfortunately she was so scared and emotionally overwhelmed that she had the banker call her ex husband on the phone to help the process
58.83,90.66, she you know the woman very capable successful small business owner was unable to open a bank account and it really at home for me because i could not imagine ever being in that situation so i helped her you know helped her with her administrative side i helped her you know getting her only banking set up by helped her something so simple a cur internet wasn't working and she hadn't didn't have
90.69,111.66, you know think about how to get that fix so we worked on simple things like that getting her husband order and eventually they became things that she figured out how to do now after this one event i started to go through my own divorce but i had come up with this idea i thought i minister this business and as all of you know
111.72,113.76, everybody's divorce is different
113.85,122.58, different personalities different people different family structures different assets doctors but the one thing i will tell you that regardless
122.58,129.51, the structure of the family with the personalities divorce
129.54,146.43, cause overwhelming emotions and unless it's a really short marriage with no children no assets maybe you can kind of move on as if it were just another relationship that didn't work out but anything that really involves more than that
146.55,152.64, it just becomes bigger than simply a piece of paper that needs to be signed and
152.79,158.04, on one hand it a business transaction because you really are dividing up
158.07,174.27, our debating a home or dividing the furniture your dividing up a bank account but on the other hand you're also dividing lives through dividing children's lives for defining extended family lives in some cases here to be riding up friends and 
174.45,189.54, that we can ever imagine what that feels like until we are in it and so what my business is is trying to help with through all of those different components with you
189.63,214.11, whether it i'm not sure if i want to get to force helping think about what are the consequences of getting to force what are the consequences of staying together understanding what the process of divorces in before you make the decision understanding that it can be a very long and difficult process understanding what the impact is going to be on your family understanding your finances i mean
214.14,241.23, not going to help you invest your money but we might be able to sit down and say this is what i've got this is what i need to live on this is where i think we can negotiate helping you think about the children what's the best place for them how can we minimize the impact on the children there are so many decisions and they're all coming at you and if you're also holding down a job trying to go into work every day
241.35,275.52, feeling brand new and ready to conquer the world is really hard so having that sounding word next to having somebody that you can call having somebody to answer too that's the kind of thing that i can help you with i can help you get organized i can help you with your finances i can help you to be someone to bounce ideas of of and i can just be there as well as your confidant so there's no one perfect answer to what is the divorce her wide i start the divorce her but the end of the day
