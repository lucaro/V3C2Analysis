0.51,29.16, and everybody seemed to easewood and thanks so much for showing up on a saturday morning to day we'll go together to tour of her universe and explored together the most violent explosions of massive stars and the two main things are like to get away from it would like you to get away from this talk is that these explosions are very vital for lives without them
29.19,30.72, wouldn't be here
30.72,50.04, but also they have a flip side they could be very dangerous for lives but as a show you the most we send sensitive titians have shown that they might act not be very dangerous near our earth so we can relax and go happily so
50.04,58.77, well now that if you want to know what something is supernormal just goglets what do you do what do you find when you go go supreme
59.01,64.02, these are the things that found their tracks they called super never
64.14,74.52, is actually bad counter and there was also a music show that had a big fight about which band or movie show should be called super nova
74.94,77.31, what these things really
77.61,82.62, what does this just before we talk about suavitatis our son
83.31,89.01, or send us a very normal stock by definition its mass is one sole mass
89.88,109.77, a lot you was when you look up at the inmost some night you see a band of stars with a black patches that is that dust and that her own militarists of billions of stars attended a line a star in onoway
110.31,136.74, if you were able to get up from your seats and fly with me above the earth above her so acute and kedging you will see our only from above and it would look like him like something like this and will look like a pancake you have different things you know the strongest are very inventive they caught they have different names for different things as the glacial to interpret arms by all arms and a sinister of her own mutya
137.13,144.06, of course that's really hard to do to fly from our seats but we can look at the
144.72,150.21, we like galaxies and see what their structures are and if we do that
150.42,154.53, gaspar away we see a super nova
154.89,165.33, this i have a space telescope image of the super noiterin the galley billion or millions like her away and
165.45,174.3, this one star that aid and of at the end of its life is as luminous as tending stars combined
174.63,185.43, quite amazing that one star self can outshine a whole galaxy and therefore can become a big for us for astronomers to see a cross universe
187.68,199.77, so how do we know that it was a star and exploded well for some cases in our nearby neighborhood this case and the large man analog we saw the star before exploded
199.89,208.26, this is some image of the field there and you see this one star it doesn't look very different from the rest of it and this you know very busy field but then
208.32,215.01, later on a week later than the supernal went off and he sees something that wasn't there before much much brighter
215.1,227.88, this is near by case and this had been over what the tertian eighty seven nineteen eighty seven and therefore the name of the superbest seven eight because it was the first one of that year
228.24,242.7, this kind of investigation will you have the image of the star before explode a really powerful to willie out what star exploded and gave rise to this magnificent explosion every large firework
243.3,245.46, now like
245.97,249.48, man and human stars
249.54,261.03, life and then they die so this is just a cartoon of the life cycle of the mass of star when i see master i mean pen times the mass of her own son
261.24,268.17, so stars are formed and what they call me lagoon through very stages purposes
268.32,283.92, the star face then they spent most of their lifetime in what we call the main sequence were they happily these hangin into helium and that's how they produce the energy we see as light example for a son
284.25,288.18, he spent a lot of time on the main sequence are 
288.33,304.62, starr own son spend nine villiers one maniquet and then masters can them to some theater or some become larger they become radiant super giants and when they have exhausted the fuel
304.74,312.15, various amounts of elements that diffusing to heavy elements to produce light they explode
312.21,315.39, most of the stars that we know of
315.45,321.72, that are a rotten mess than a cat explode as loyalty to spend
322.41,327.78, stars live much faster and i much younger than her own son
327.9,335.91, only astronomical turns ten billion years at ten million years for a twenty salamander
336.33,342.0, this equite quick compared to the rest of the time skill in astronomy
343.11,367.98, so just to give a basic eye i know people have various background here just want to make sure we understand when i talk about visible life and other kinds of relation from other parts of the electing expect rum slights only their specific part of the full release sensitivities spectrum where we have it on the rainbow and tramps of the different ways langfeldt
368.13,377.91, but the electric is with broader the range of will also concentrate to day's gamestress energies
378.0,394.92, lonsdale the highest energies from in the whole range and of course the other ranges from everybody has heard of the radio wave flings then at the make way in fred we continually see the infrared omission but 
395.1,417.75, more in terms of heat there the overland then x rays and the sad the lowest energy photons packages so to speak and he said the highest energy once so i will concentrate to day on the visible range of water ice can see but also talk about garies that are omitted from these really violent explosion
417.99,419.61, erfurt
420.63,429.18, so why are superior and while we study them why do we care about them while sophomorical for own life
429.51,442.86, produce a lot of the elements we consist of so this is an image of a superior exploded in our once that was observed in sixteen o four by kepler himself actually
443.01,449.73, and the images collected by the emission from various kinds of elements
449.88,470.85, this is cleopatra bones in the green stuff is iron that submitting so that's really important in a blood and an oxygen of course really vital for an weigheth in in bloom and that has led the number of people in caliginosa we are made of star dust
470.85,498.66, we made up of elements that were expelled and partly also produced during the explosion of a massive star so i think that's real beautiful image that actually drew me initially to this field of supernature a very cataclysmic event very more with event death of a star at the same time gives rise to something vital which is all these various elements that make up our own body
499.53,544.47, now they also separate by the because the trigger the formation of other stars so this is an image again from the hall space telescope and the ablest of is really important important palace for astronomers because it's above the atmosphere and so it has very very good resolution it has a very good special the capability to really resolve things of very small special case where we can really closely look at his amazing astronomical events and objects so this is an image from the hospice telescope showing the orion nebula where a lot of stars are forming and there emission is hitting up the nebular round them that is admitting at various wales
545.49,572.85, and so never really cool they leave behind very extreme objects i'm sure you've heard about black holes outran tars paladins forth so this is an image taken foothold and chandra and the third telescope that's another space called the piementelle scope and it's a composite of this supernatural exploded in a onoro five hundred years ago
572.97,602.46, and so loathsome as years ago and when you zom into this spot here in the center you see the actual object that was left behind so this is a chandranath as the central object which is a pulse so it's a star in translated over very dense so the mass of it is round one soames for the mass of the sun but its concentrated on a very small volume
603.3,615.78, the size of new york and imagined pushed putting the whole sun into a very small space size of new york and that's what you get and it has really strong admission at the pools
616.38,626.43, and that's what chantraine ex ways and also how invisible and if you take a number of images as a french of time you see that its changing
626.73,632.43, now i'm going to try to show a movie and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
634.65,680.97, yes so you see says he i just taking over a couple of two weeks oh over the term of two weeks and you see that a lot of things are happening there subject coming out its emitting a number of high energy electrons than admitting in the extras realme structure against the strangers are like to give names to everything in detail to this is the torturous a wisp and so forth and people can really student using those images how exactly the pulses moving he rapidly it spinning and what kind of environment and has around it so this amazing explosions left behind his related objects black holes that we don't see but then other kinds etretat politicans
682.17,719.61, and suneva tell us about universe so not the kind of sublimated and talking about to day which are due to masters with other kinds in any case those explosions of one specific star and as a set because they're so luminous compared to ten to deny so billion sons they can be seen over large distances throughout universe and that tell us about universe held universe expanded over the last thirteen billion years and that led to an amazing discovery in ninety eight which was that of the accelerating universe
719.79,735.33, we always thought that university expanding and perhaps expansion slowing down because of the force of gravity but the surprising result and there you see this cartoon of isadore surprised to see that universe a universe is actually accelerating
735.42,740.1, and this he said discovery that was
740.28,759.36, made by a number of people including alex hoping who you might have heard earlier this this year a number of other people his gratitude and another go up the hill and about discovery was voted the best of the society of europe of ninety eight and since
760.08,767.16, to this end a really great tools too because they're so luminous and canvasing across large distances
768.63,781.11, so how does the star look like before it explodes while we think that during the life time of the star it undergoes various degrees of nuclear burning where it
781.17,803.19, as hydrogen first into helium and then held him when the sun was in hydrogen it perihelium into oxygen and therefore goes down the chain has her parable so this is dissent of her star so that at twenty five solmes's this little simple here the solar symbol
803.31,806.1, and the center of the stooks like an onion
806.46,812.67, it has various layers made of different amounts of elements and in the centre is made of iron
813.0,824.34, somehow when a mass of star reaches its iron core it no longer can run i ran into something heavier and still gained energy
825.36,832.41, so what happens then is it reaches rely the fatal part of its life no longer can
832.44,838.38, extract and ay and the court self imposed it starts to contract
838.89,845.46, when it reaches a rare certain density nuclear benstein the centre it becomes really stiff
845.94,848.34, and the parts
848.49,861.57, don't know about the fact that it's become really stiff the clash on it and this crash leads to shock was a short way that her travels again outward soon the star and explodes the star itself
862.02,900.75, said mat sound a little bit counted too on the fact that the first have an inclusion and somehow that leads to explosion but they think that's what's happening we have a number of his of evidence that that support that and i had intentions to bring out a very sophisticated model that explains it but because as you know the unbudded and so forth i couldn't quite do that so i use a low budget action so i'm finishing something added supposed to jest again visualize the basic concept of the explosion itself of course in some societies i have to wear these
900.78,908.52, glasses without them so missing my lab coat but then there would be a deal to the main point is what i'm going to do
909.0,914.4, i'm going to have this now gadget hit the
914.4,928.77, and that's supposed to show you what happens when a certain amount of mass is reaching a certain point where become stiff and this little piece is going to be the outlayers of the star
929.13,935.43, and we'll see what happens to this red little piece and fortunately is quite small and that everybody might see it
935.43,938.82, but that's a minor slept
941.34,945.78, a point that should be in the center here okay
946.29,963.66, i have another one cetacean seem the singing to try to throw it and is it if anybody is able to catch a please hold on to it and return it later on again but its yoke
964.95,975.99, with some fine like at last as one so then so what is happening well what's happening is that
976.38,1005.87, these are balls somuch heavier much have much more mass than this little red one are importing momentum to the red little ball that is much less massive and that leads to the fact that this red ball is really shooting off and going into another direction very similar basically or simply speaking to the outliers of the star that is first imploring and then exploding last one for the eminent able to do this very straight
1007.73,1014.24, the bois wasn't a semitic explosion that he went this way
1015.08,1038.51, so this is the basic idea how an inclosing can lead to the explosion of a star and a lot of people in astronomy pestiferous have been trying for the last thirty years to simulate this event in the computers and fortunately in its execute embarrassing they haven't been able to do that in detail because the physics is really detailed and very messy
1038.87,1057.05, but that's one of the frontiers and super nova physics and supernaturally figure out the details of how it exactly happens however nature of course knows he how to do it and we see these kinds of explosions are many times in various kinds of galaxies
1057.41,1068.66, give you a sense of it the rat said the insurance rate of supines one supernumerary years paramilitary galaxy
1069.14,1084.56, those things are quite common relatively speaking hundred years is very societies amy and so in our milkwood expect that one went off every hundred years and i will talk about galaktionov in the second
1085.31,1105.74, okay so we astronomers we have telescopes across the globe a discover little bit of a field for it so or earth and the here we have so new and specifically california has a number of great telescopes there some here in hawaii
1105.77,1144.41, we have to go to hawaii and portly for work then we have he chiltern of telescopes in chile and we would like to have telescopes at places that a very high up he don't have the atmosphere much of the atmosphere between you ethelind tresset because the atmosphere leads to twinkling her after after tsessebe the lightest mudberry bounces around in the atmosphere so dearly would like to go in space but if he can't be still try to build telescopes on high mountains
1145.01,1161.3, all want to be somewhere that's dry because a lot of the gathering and happens to two and absorption had happened to to water in the atmosphere so we want to go to place at that overdrive such as chilly for example that has the atacama as one of the
1161.39,1168.26, a desert in the world or in the ambition the number of telescopes are there
1168.5,1173.21, you have telescopes here in australia you have some and the canary islands
1173.75,1185.78, off the coast of africa and again the european astronomers that that operate those tells always complain why they have to go to the canary islands that have also nice letters
1185.81,1206.96, this is a really worries and specifically setting supervisory international effort because superna they become luminous but then they fade with an a couple of days or weeks and therefore you have to observe right away with whatever telescopes you have to rely track their life output as a function of time very closely
1208.22,1268.37, who are the supraners the number of them one very prolific supervise is that locally here in california by perpetual philip pango and we only doorway and the apparitional observatory supervise nearer in some hosannas among hamilton and there incredibly prolific they signed up to hundred hundred fifty supernatural actually as an undergrad myself when i was here a fusible i helped his group in supervisor as a freshman i would look so various images and try to find this new objects is now exploding stars and as alexandre built your character to look through all these leaden we detect automated the enamel a second how how it happened and how we do now days how we conduct the search for superb
1268.43,1301.43, of course actually a number of amateurs are also really active in a contributing to the super nooning game one of the most prolific ones impact shown him felt of his telescope and actually certain percent of all near by superabound by amateurs and they just have the money and education to get a telescope to buy a camera not very unsimilar to our decandra actually and equipoise and look at galaxies every night to find the new exploding stars
1301.82,1324.02, the youngest supervene actually is a year old girl who was featured the most recently and was then invited to go deep awhile house when prison boma had a night of astronomy where they had telescopes out on the lawn and various people middle school children will looking through and she was featured as the youngest
1324.23,1326.54, in the world
1328.37,1346.46, then we have to superpowers so speak those people to astronomers mostly who don't find suneva but then follow them up to understand them in detail and there the stars before they exploded and what how much energy the releasing what kind of elements the releasing and so forth
1346.64,1365.36, this is a picture of a telescope in arizona which i used to go to as a graduate student the diameter of this telescope is six point five meters so metronomes usually give that give indicate the diameter of the telescope and the bigger the better
1365.81,1387.65, it has a long light gathering power and of course when we do start observing return of the light in the dome so this is just for you now press release and barristers and indifferency like me sometimes said with snow and the downward present i couldn't observe so you would just get an image of the close of course treated so makes sense
1387.89,1411.38, the telescope is mentioned we go to and i do tempest at telescopes and hawaii so this is an image of the two twin telescopes the top at four thousand meters of hawaii and can be cold even in the summer and he can be snow on the ground while other people at the beach down are enjoying themselves
1411.47,1415.28, those are some foreloper that
1415.37,1426.11, then we have other conciliation the and steadiness and at me a couple of years ago while i was observing at the summit there
1426.77,1460.46, so these are the tools and the poise of the spectre have to observe these exploding stars so this is a gallery of various supernatant host galaxies so the galaxies that surround them such a one occasion supervenit nine in this galaxy with the carrying name and you see one six three seven and and this is separated actually was found by kate and this is the supernal
1460.52,1464.09, again keep in mind one star
1464.09,1470.78, that became luminous and really outshone one billion other neighbouring stars
1471.35,1477.35, now this is another image and who can guess we can muster superfather
1477.41,1484.28, this is one the one is obvious now however on this one word spinther
1484.52,1485.84, guess
1486.35,1493.04, these ones are beatrice in this case it's this one here this is the
1493.67,1497.51, that wasn't there before exploding star
1497.96,1540.14, do we find these things as i said sometimes it's obvious to see in a way but at the time in a patrick because you have a lot of substructure in your galaxy looking at so what we do is we subtract images and images that have been taken over a large time range or arrange offertories you have at one apportion galaxy in them incumbent three weeks later in observe same field the same fields and you look at it again and that in iyotanka a boy doesn't move very different however if you do a subtraction where you subtract a one
1540.14,1542.96, see something that wasn't there before
1543.02,1551.66, everything else that state constance in terms of its life out but is gone because he distracted it and as you know easily gotten back that thing that
1551.66,1554.33, exploded and new is still there
1554.87,1580.22, and we can do that now for the last ten years a certain years now since we have the title cameras that he can use that have really revolutionized astronomy before that people were observing using plates and then you conscious easily subtract however with literal images like you know the camera to have with fictitious those are really powerful because you can manipulate those images in detail
1581.99,1613.16, so being a super nova stronger is really exciting you never know what happens you can usually not tell in advance if you look at the start he is going to go supererogate to be really older and that happen in two thousand eight where a very interesting object was captured between now called to thousand eight inches and what happened there was it's actually a really really great story because it shows you how important her indifferent is
1613.31,1615.92, astronomy discoveries
1616.49,1622.91, so in two thousand eight number two strangers from princeton were looking at
1623.06,1638.39, from the masses salkeld swift that observes and express and they were actual looking at the supernatant seven wi that had gone off in that one galaxy and they were following it up for their own studies
1638.93,1647.12, happened was on general nine when they looked at the same frame again they saw a new much writer object
1647.36,1683.75, you object that hadn't been there before and first we weren't sure what it was the optical images of ultimates of the same galaxies idea now this whole galloped now inclined at shoutit of new stuff but we were really excited and untoward exactly was now held in a second what would what it could be but we had different amounts of guesses we sat i could be some kind of an reverse liltak about those in the second but in order to really tell what kind of object it is to need spectre
1684.05,1691.88, spectra are tools to split up the life as a function of wales
1692.21,1696.86, see how much letters as a function of what length and that like a thing of trent
1696.92,1704.15, surbase a shower kind of elements that are the givers to mission or absorption of that light
1704.15,1706.88, the astronomers
1707.15,1728.96, send out a circular across the globe saying look we found this releasing object when she wore it is it's in time by galaxy only nineteen million live here away it's one would have been if it had been a camberwell a cameriere observed ever and so a lot of astronomical the world tranter calicoes
1729.23,1748.76, to this object including ourselves however we also had observed in same galaxy with the super nova before and we were lucky because we were having these images taken with telescope in arizona in the enthralled parte
1749.27,1755.63, we have images of the same galaxy was the supine to three hours before the ex ray detection
1755.87,1762.17, and then we observed the nightly and you know the next night and we saw well this is an object this was to 
1762.38,1793.85, he continued observing the same galaxy and we could make fancy plots of this as ever technical sitalces for that but the main point was he could observe this object very early on we got data in the limner of filters we got spectres of the other things i mentioned where we saw that it had certain elements that give rise to absorption in the spectrum specifically helium and we could study the supervention signed out that i didn't have hidden
1793.85,1800.78, spectrum therefore the outermost layer of hydrogen was no longer there but you could see the next inner one
1800.81,1802.04, appeal
1802.91,1846.77, and he took meditations later and saw that a certain lines had very specific shade shape and from that he could deduce the geometry of the explosion to be found that it actually wasn't around explosion as he might perhaps guess but it was a circle the shape of it was more like a tourist like donut then sphere and said that was real exciting that led he had pressed release and a number of people in the audience actually hear helped deformed and others contributed their efforts to this really great story and when when i had a discussion or interview with porter were really amazed to think of her of her toes
1846.8,1857.6, a shape for the superman the person who interviewed said well looks like a dome like oh i guess yeh that's the shape of the door so he was quite impressed about that
1858.23,1875.36, so now you might wonder well their explosions that happen in other galaxies i mentioned the one i should rooshan in a galaxy that is emilio light years away which means that the light took ninety mile years to reach us
1875.45,1878.48, the actual event that go back to that
1879.62,1892.07, nineteen molinero when dinosaurs were roaming bursts that actually quite amazing to think to think of that but because of the vast distances in universe and the fact that light
1892.1,1902.15, travel at a constant speed we have this time delay where we read what we know about events and universe much much later
1902.96,1911.99, so for astronomy this was as the quite close only nineteen like tearaway okay so you might wonder
1912.5,1939.35, which explosion happened in her own malay and we have historic record of those well we do there for we know of in terms of the recent history so to thousands the the explosions of penitent was detected to the six by number of astronomers across the globe a chinese airiness and an explosion that was visible was the naked eye actually
1939.83,1943.94, and that was visible for mister mac editors years
1944.18,1989.0, we have historical record of those then there's another one as some fifty four then more recent ones too super nova in fifteen seventy two and the capitulation of four and we can still see the substance remnants of those explosions because the matter that was expelled is moving outwards and interacting with the medium that is between the star and other stars giving by aloof omission to be constrained or telescopes in this case the tender exotic and out a space to observe these would recall supereminent and still see a lot of interesting structure of the material that is moving outward contracting with the circumstantial
1989.33,2002.77, of course the next the question is when is the next superior going to happen here on old as he said the usual rate is one per henders promote we haven't had one in four hundred years so we really open you for superno
2002.77,2007.39, the kinds of candidates we have but who can recognize this constellation
2007.9,2031.96, arrian exactly since actually up also now at rominten so forth peacock at you look up the setting feature ainsell and a number of other stars and actually distorter but orionis actually are next candidate because it is a star that this undergoing the last phases of its life
2032.56,2034.9, and
2034.96,2039.73, as far as we can as far as reno could explode to any second
2039.91,2047.53, so we don't use actually really large star that thousand times the size of her son so he were to put little justin her own
2047.53,2057.34, some system it would swallow the interplanet including earth and just be out on close to ire satirises acting really really big star
2057.94,2060.01, a red giant
2060.49,2067.6, another candid we have it granny watched meenits
2067.63,2079.06, presentation a couple of months ago he works on those this specific start self in again this is a very very mastering round hundred soames's that could explode any second
2079.81,2090.76, so we astronomically do have proposals of what to do exactly if the next galactic super nova happens and if it's close by it would be really really bright
2090.79,2121.39, so bright that might be even being a drink the day and perhaps so bright that even our own telescopes which are used to very faint objects would be saturated completely if this election happens however we have a lot of dust in our own milky way so a lot of the like might give absorbed so might not be albright as we think or argue so we not sure yet but if you hear next time dinewandoo that what is whether
2121.87,2132.82, well with her and talk about gambrel the monster explosions of universe and the story again as a very interesting story of how disordered in the first place
2132.82,2166.57, in the american president there signed a partial nuclear test entreaty to make sure that they're no nucleated specifically and russia and stay started to have versifies gambara satellite that were orbiting the earth to check that no test nucleated those kinds of nephites would admit cameras and in the second i thessalia sadie where at an space and the detective gambler emission
2166.63,2177.79, ever that generation didn't come from earth it came from all other directions except her and so had led to to the cover of the camera burst
2177.91,2180.46, i mentioned cameriste most energetic
2180.52,2184.6, and so the objects that produced
2184.6,2190.33, did a lot of these high energy radiation and that includes a lot of high energies
2191.23,2202.81, so the sad was discovered by belinda's intensities a big mistletoe was well what does the distance where did they come from
2202.87,2217.24, they come from ornate local or other catolica do they come from very far away galaxies and if they came from very far away alexomenos the intrinsic energy that the mittemeyer really large
2217.57,2233.26, the test for that one of the sethites called baby well the instruments called bats the commonplace observed a number two thousand have hand within four gamebirds and saw that
2233.32,2250.54, were actually across the whole sky so this actually projection of the whole sky in all directions the now if you were able to look so dear and so forth and look around you the system view you would have in certain new projection
2250.54,2256.45, maps and the portentous all his points were deserters
2256.72,2279.37, the whole sky however if he were to be confined to just mould expect there would be in the plane of the mole where we see a lot of the other objects no not so this was very strong clue that he were cosmologically events that i came from other galaxies that had distributed around us and not from what once
2279.82,2286.39, and mine is seven people got what he called the first wretches to really pink quite the distance
2286.54,2304.18, that amory burst in the show that was a cosmological burst and so for with had a number of other verstorbenen the distance and then not in our own neewa so this cameraman the outside to whom universe in a few seconds and gamaliel
2304.81,2316.39, and we think now that they're due to death a very massive stars and so this is a cartoon and animation than with massa that shows how
2316.42,2328.93, again illustrates how a star is emitting what the cadets that is again that those are again the objects then then in the canaries
2329.17,2331.42, and this is a movie
2332.23,2351.22, you see here he said really narrow yet said or able to drill themselves through the star to the sissoo for your thirty so amatory and over time is emitting a very quickly sustainable just within couple of second sexually so the animation takes longer than the real thing
2351.43,2358.24, and then at the end he what you left behind is the central dance objected rising is a black hole
2358.39,2369.04, self and that she left behind but the caricature of the stammerer of his really narrow jest that the midlothian radiation
2369.91,2397.42, so what we think are the stars said implore as canarybird well if you look at them start at the monasteries in the tenants then as i mentioned it has the orient structure where you have the hydrogen layer at the very outermost layer then the next inner one is helmsworth to go down the elements of the predicable and anyhow a very enthusiast
2397.84,2405.73, if this if this star explodes it will give rise to a normal a regular super nova
2406.12,2422.74, however if you have stars whose out and blows have been stripped so who are so be more naked and that sense don't have the hydrogen or the hill lay at the outermost layer and those ten explodes
2422.83,2445.75, the present store of these games and we still don't full income exactly they make the jets during the actual corlisses and a lot of people working on that but from the superduper we see in the game but a receipt they have no trace of hydrogen or helium that to be dismally highly stripped stars before they explode
2446.71,2473.29, and again these explosions are beckons to the highest wretchedest isabel was protected and two thousand nine in april to sent third of april this is its called jernington three and it made a worldwide news that it was the most distant object observed after people were able to get to get an estimate of its wretched of its distance
2473.41,2489.61, this game burst is at the distance of potentilla light hers so that's only six hundred forty million years after the big banks every early on in the infant universe and it is really the record for the highest
2489.82,2492.22, largest distance explosion
2492.34,2495.73, so the powerful powerful means
2495.82,2525.58, you had another again robert that was observed with the nassaline swift and so the the express optical or which was actually a naked eye gammers so gamburdo give rise to only generation but they also give rise to a lot of other mission including that that can be seen with our own eyes in the visible life in exact and the mission for a few seconds was so bright that if you had been able to look at it he would have seen it with your own eyes
2525.76,2530.77, but that only lasted for a couple of seconds that memorable afterglow faded very quickly
2531.34,2550.75, this is an artist conception of what you saw there where you saw again his jest but in this case might have had two kinds of jests at one it was had a wider angle said that was you know shown here with niello and then you had a much narrower jet in the centre here
2550.81,2565.03, had much higher energies which we then saw because we were in the beam of the step so techniques in you might ask as well what happens if a gabion her once
2565.27,2593.95, we have to be in again exactly the color these very energetic jets so people strangers who looked the look at that and the impact of high agitation on our own earth found that actually could be quite the tremenda a deepeneth could destroy one half of her son layer it could triglia change course at the details you know are still debated and could even cause mass estacion to those could be really really dangerous
2595.39,2614.89, were they were to go off on our own you hear now that's very you know important question to consider and look where yearbook of environment no jereed so i let the project to look in detail at some of these gebusted
2614.98,2626.77, happened in a local universe and i'm sorry to again a very technical plot but the main point is where a plaintiveness and so neither is and found that their unspecific
2626.95,2631.78, of the diagram in comparison though the mice is up here
2631.87,2640.06, it is in this range for what we call lucienne intrinsic one of the intrinsic characteristic features
2640.09,2650.23, but milosch further out where all the other thereupon or on her so a compulsion was the actual democracy and likely
2650.47,2669.07, cost a grease it does not contain such low much lists as this other galaxies and rhimeson taine and said very unlikely again and here for comparison exactly as were some and the mocha a spread of these features of lists
2669.19,2684.19, and so we concluded and the number of other people standing at all protection six that actually rest is very safe from ceres the chances that one happens to annotate very small less anoint one per cent or so
2684.19,2691.75, you can relax you can go to day and say well probably no superabit happen and now on mikawaya not
2692.59,2718.03, so this is the concluding slide i hope i give you to her for amazing universe including these cosmic fireworks that are both very vital for life but also pullingers but again you can relax to day thank you very much for your pension
