0.09,31.44, my name is margaret in the academical for the national clabbered for average mahaut collaborating centre that supported the demoleon of this new book and we were really excited to do that to my teachers my elder teachers have often talked about nor you've been margo
32.01,36.18, where your family has been so you can learn from that
36.48,41.58, move forward into the future stately bearing that you take the strength
41.94,43.71, those things
43.74,47.7, a lot of the teachings through are threaded through time
47.79,53.67, there anchored in your family and your kinship relationships but they threaded through time
53.79,56.64, each generation learn the
56.64,62.76, each generation teaches these and so they really are our strings so
62.97,72.27, back to see what was i taught what are those values that that i've been taught the willamet to live in harmony and balance
72.33,78.84, so that i'm just not looking forward in the world with nothing with no
78.84,93.66, it's like supports behind me are knowledge behind me but i have a whole wealth of history and knowledge and family behind me that i take with me and bring to the future now i live that reality
93.84,108.42, so may not look the way my mother odorante loved it but the fundamental teaching of that are there but they will look different and contemporary reality so i reach my hand back
108.66,113.76, those teachings learning and bring them forward because they're going to help me
113.82,118.65, to go that my current realities and evadna good way
119.04,120.48, what i mean by that
120.99,133.11, and in i think i wrote about it in the chapter he used to always see to me because i would ask him he went to residential schools and you know all of the stories that her patricia schools he experienced
133.35,137.25, i said how can you do this day be such in about catholic
138.63,140.1, what possible
140.64,149.46, you were over years somehoo so that ever going home and as when he said to me marie said i take with good
149.79,151.71, the rest behind
152.85,156.09, so he took what was good in his days
156.33,158.55, took it good in his own
158.88,163.41, world culture the way was raised and knowledge
163.41,165.21, and i put the two together
166.62,172.92, and i would be surprised if a lot of people are doing that code shifting all the time
173.28,200.94, because we don't live in the past the way we used to look different but what are those values that we carry with us and how we express these things in these different worlds and how do we be mindful and self reflective a man means the we need to be really solid about who we are so that we can move back an forth and just flow easily back and forth without moving
201.63,204.78, there the richness of those environment
205.41,207.33, that's what i think though
207.54,215.22, i remember once one of my teachers are really told her teacher had told me the story once and she said
215.43,218.97, a little boy he was four and a half maybe five
219.51,224.07, and every time his grandma came to the pre school
224.4,230.04, and they would be having lunch you know special events right and grandma would come
230.58,232.47, and
232.71,234.96, every time gracchan
235.47,237.03, he would feed him
237.69,238.77, all
241.23,244.8, food and always the
244.98,253.08, shy is he doing that you know and the thought has just been mazeres this areyou know
253.14,259.17, and then finally i think she said that one of the carvers sat
259.98,262.92, come you do that when you're groaned
263.19,265.11, let him do that
265.89,275.01, you know how to use their night in the fort coniston because he was you know spoke kindergarten age i said i do hate because it makes my grandma happy
277.02,282.54, i think that's a powerful powerful story in the
283.17,286.86, when i reflect on that the absolute
287.28,290.19, thoughtful as some relate of that child
290.85,293.04, he knew exactly what he was to 
293.49,295.92, do you know exactly why i was doing it
296.4,299.31, i think we need to
299.34,311.19, allow tilden to do things to code switch to be who they are and not judge them and give them those give them opportunities
312.0,318.03, then we learn from the men and a beautiful paulo
318.51,319.98, his grandmother
321.12,326.61, i mean just amazing and as an all i wouldn't do that
327.36,331.32, please her heart
331.83,334.02, important i think
