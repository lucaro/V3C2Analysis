432.21,436.32, to hispanic audiences because they are affected more than most
436.62,464.07, an interesting thing would happen when i give a speech i go out to my car afterwards to get in and without fail there would be a young person usually a young woman i might add waiting to see me in the darkness and shadows around my car and she would look both ways and say senator i'm one of those dreamers but i swore to my mamma dead i would never say that to anybody because they're afraid i'm going to get deported that was the state of play fifteen years ago
464.52,465.87, changed
465.87,478.86, usually does when young people are warned not to say things over and over eventually they not only say it but start saying them loudly and dreamers said them loudly they stood up spoke up
478.95,562.5, and gave me their stories i've been to the floor of the senate i think a hundred times with the stories of individual dreamers color photographs which i bring them for to tell the story without fail i can tell you because i do this for a living people listen because i love stories number one and number two these are real stories of some amazing young people who just need a chance to become part of america's future officially so i will tell you that the dreamers themselves have become great establishment forestalled me were now up to netherwoods but as long as regenerating watchfulness
562.5,579.27, football games across america and the general population mark in the th anniversary of i'm sure every one here remembers in some way another what they were doing that day i was in the capital and a meeting with the senate democratic leadership with the majority later tom dash
579.54,587.52, calling us together at nine o'clock as we got on the elevator to come to the meeting we heard a plane had struck the world trade center
587.67,601.65, sounded so unusual but then as we walked into the room turned on the t v and saw the second plan strike the other tower were realized this was no aviation accident this was an attack on the united states
601.77,645.45, a lot of talk about what we were going to do and then someone looked down the mall from the capital and saw the black smoke billowing you cross the potomac in the mall from the plain that crashed into the pentagon with amenity called on us to evacuate the capital at which it was the first time that it ever occurred in time that i've been around and every one stood out on the grass not sheratt do tourist and staff and members of congress and we heard what we thought at first were bombs they were silicones as they were scrambling fighters over the capital for fear that the plan that was eventually brought down in pennsylvania was coming here to strike the capital or the white house as its next target
645.84,651.36, well that was a scene in a moment in american history that we can never forget
651.63,659.25, next day september had scheduled the first ever congressional hearing on the dream act
659.58,662.13, it was canceled for obvious reasons
662.13,666.36, determined to include the dream act in a comprehensive immigration reform bill
666.63,669.63, an what have included a path to citizenship
669.96,678.12, a blue sky morning years and one day go it seemed entirely possible even likely that such a plan was within reach
678.6,679.86, the plane hit
680.25,683.07, innocent americans died
683.43,686.7, immigration debate turned into a security debate
687.18,690.33, wasn't until years later
690.42,693.36, the senate finally held the first hearing in the dream act
693.75,700.29, a moving forward on comprehensive immigration reform after congress turned its attention to security
700.53,704.16, ned up non immigrant visus for students and visitors
704.19,717.9, sort of thesis that terrorists had abused we established new restrictions and enhance security measures for us citizens we spent hundreds of billions of dollars and literally changed our life style when it came to catching an airplane
718.11,732.24, repeated efforts by some of us in congress to pass caprification reform for the last ten years changes in our immigration law policies of focused overwhelmingly on keeping dangerous people out of america
732.54,736.26, unresolved or other questions urgently important
736.35,740.04, we fix our system to let the right people in
740.04,747.21, let them stay if they're already here how do we aligned america's immigration policies with the real needs of our future
747.39,772.14, instead of forcing millions of documented workers to live fearfully in the shadows in poverty or near poverty a number of events since have made passing comrades of immigration reform even more challenging let me tell you three first the global economic melt down of two thousand eight two thousand nine cotillions of americans their jobs when the president was sworn in his first day
772.47,776.01, in a month here we lost euramerican jobs
776.4,778.2, i were disappearing
778.29,785.01, the americans still felt economically bettered and vulnerable as a result of that cataclysm but who could blame him
785.37,791.31, some fear that emigrants might take their jobs or they might be a costly drain on public budgets
791.37,794.37, a comprehensive immigration reform harder
795.54,801.57, a refugee crisis is causing anxiety america and much of the rest of the world
801.81,803.25, specially europe
803.34,805.41, he and the breath
805.53,811.08, forces and succeeded partly by deminishing immigrants and refugees
811.08,814.56, terrorists criminals addicts are welfare cheeks
814.65,820.41, persuaded a bare majority that the only way to save great britain was to wall it off from the rest of europe
820.89,824.25, former british foreign secretary william hague
824.52,831.9, believe campaign is really the trump campaign with better hair and britain is alone
831.9,838.02, a german chancellor englemere announced that her nation would take as many as a million refugees
838.02,840.39, violence in syria and elsewhere
840.39,843.39, it was a stunning act of statement statesmanship
843.57,854.64, what happened last week the backlash chancellor merkel sent a right christian democratic union party finished a dismal third place in regional election in her home constituency
855.0,861.78, place went to a three year old hard line anti anti immigrant party alternative for decent
862.05,866.22, at parties and politicians are gaining new supporters and france
866.28,869.64, boston greece poland and hungary
870.03,874.2, nations long considered bastions of tolerance attitudes are hardening
874.62,889.26, immigrant any refuge sentiment in europe is even harsher than in the us it is fed not only by economic anxiety but also by fear and anger in the wet in the wake of unconscionable terrace attacks in paris brussels teanaustaye
889.8,896.55, a third factor that makes many in congress hesitant to take up comprehensive immigration reform is frankly
897.0,900.33, bloviation of donald trump and a follower
900.48,902.25, what's next
902.82,908.55, the chance that we could finally see progress in the next congress on matters affecting immigrants and refugees
908.67,911.19, return to that larger debate
911.31,915.0, the ugly anti immigrant rather edric that we hear
915.03,918.0, in the presidential campaign poisoned the debate
918.03,920.85, we remain stuck in stalemate
921.18,922.98, there is a reason to be hopeful
923.4,928.8, i have seen a simple that was released last week and let me caution you in advance
928.92,936.27, never use a power point so you're about to see the only power point i have ever used in a herd
936.63,947.55, people were asked thinking about the way the u s government deals with the issue of illegal immigration which the following policy goals should be the government's top priority if you read from right to left
947.85,958.2, starting early the november than september percent of respondents now say
958.32,983.52, the top priority of american immigration laws and policy should be developing a plan to allow those in the us illegally we have jobs become residents a pathway legal status fifty one per cent that's a five per cent from a year ago another interesting point look at the percentage of respondence who said that america's top immigration priority should be deporting immigrants who are already in the country illegally
983.61,990.24, go percent rank that as a top immigration priority to day eleven per cent
990.78,996.48, the possible priorities deporting documented immigrants comes in a distant third
996.63,1005.63, instead of poisoning well perhaps mister trunk trumps or ugly rhetoric could actually help the bill momentum for balanced immigration reform
1006.08,1017.99, i was part of the gang as dean trainer mentioned the tried to put together a comprehensive bill a bill which ended up passing the senate sixty eight thirty two with fourteen republicans on board
1018.17,1020.09, over three years ago
1020.3,1025.31, republican leaders had allowed the bill to come to the house for it would be the law of the land to day
1025.82,1028.82, more than enough votes in the house on both sides the aisle
1028.91,1033.62, happen they held it off and they wouldn't let any immigration bill come to the floor
1033.98,1035.36, he was tough
1035.42,1044.81, publicans gain control of the senate and republican leaders threatened for months to shut down the department of homeland security unless the senate voted to deport dreamers
1045.05,1046.34, making that up
1046.55,1052.04, democrats refused in the end we won the stand off with the president support
1052.1,1063.74, i am ready for the gang of eight to suit up again and get ready in the next session of congress two of the four republican gang of mate members or still publicly supporting our work the other two
1063.74,1085.82, an action but the two who were supporting or lindsay graham and chelae who i want to say i admire much for standing up for this concept of a bipartisan approach to comprehensive immigration reform i hope to join them in the next congress to make another effort i think the majority americans are going to reject donald trump's immigrant fashion
1085.88,1108.05, the election results in numbers like those in the new and then paul will persuade more of our friends across the aisle to join us if they want to be a presidential party it has to be an expanding party reaching out to new populations when president obaa was reelected in highest
1108.08,1110.15, from african americans
1110.21,1113.06, the highest hispanic americans
1113.09,1121.22, second his asian americans why asian americans they heard every word that was said between romney
1121.28,1133.88, an election campaign about immigration and though they are by nature more conservative in their thinking in their background and their families when it came to the issue of immigration they knew where the party stood
1133.97,1145.58, now there were times when john mc cain and others would stand up and say if our party has a future we have got to be an expanding party open to new populations well they've taken a reversal this time with their current nominee
1145.61,1167.18, whether or not the any immigrant hard lines continued to block copperas of immigration reform in the next congress are next president needs to be prepared from day one to use her legal authority to make our immigration system far and more rational now i've heard the tityre argument that president obama's poisoned the well with his executive orders on immigration
1167.18,1175.76, the president was using his well established legal authority to set immigration priorities congress certainly had its chance to lead
1175.79,1190.22, i mentioned three important steps the new president should take one the president should authorize all qualified dreamers to serve in america's armed forces immigrants have fought and died to defend america's freedom since the revolutionary war
1190.64,1192.62, no i am come
1192.71,1204.41, parents spoke so eloquently at the democratic convention is part of that old tradition well it was a week ago almost ten days the islamic foundation had its national convention in chicago
1204.44,1207.68, and it didn't work in my schedule but then i heard
1207.74,1213.53, stand his wife were going to be there manderson of democratic invention
1213.71,1219.95, my schedule and said i have to mate and i did set down with his gracious man tis well

1237.5,1240.56, gives a copy of the constitution to each of them
1240.65,1247.13, remember at the convention when he held up his copy the constitution i thought to myself what do i need from this man
1247.22,1252.08, what i need i needed to sign my copy of my constitution which he did
1252.83,1262.25, marine lands corporal whose dates permanent resident for the us foreign aguadilla the first american service member killed in the war in iraq
1263.15,1265.07, as citizenship
1265.07,1271.28, there are so many dreamers young men and women who want the opportunity to defend america
1271.31,1274.91, like captain con lance corporal ceteris
1276.44,1281.0, i heard held a hearing on dreamers serving in the military
1281.15,1289.28, is clear the president can do this i have been begging this president whom i dearly love but can't quite get across the finish line
1289.55,1290.96, the current law
1291.2,1297.35, a president can make the decision that vital to national interests they would accept dreamers in the armed forces
1297.35,1302.87, owing them to enlist would give us a new pool of educated motivated home grown talent
1302.96,1313.43, military more diverse and inclusive and i tell you i've met young men and women who are anxious to serve they have been in orators they want to serve
1313.43,1320.51, he should be given the chance the second action the next president thank you second accident next president could take to break the stalemate
1320.51,1330.83, immigration refugees she could dramatically increase the number of refugees america except to two hundred thousand a year including a hundred thousand from syria
1331.28,1339.38, go amadis ration met the president's goal for this fiscal year of accepting ten thousand syrian refugees
1339.53,1342.47, administration hailed it as a major achievement
1342.65,1343.82, it is
1343.94,1349.55, considering the unease many americans feel about welcoming refugees i understand its controversial
1349.94,1355.37, that stirred up intentionally or not by people who wrongly complate refugees with terrorist
1356.81,1360.47, we have the ability and the moral responsibility to do better
1360.77,1364.1, a million refugees in the world today
1364.43,1367.43, just refugee crisis in recorded history
1367.79,1372.14, driven from home and syria arac afghanistan far beyond
1372.26,1376.79, erasmi by wars terrorism famine and drought
1377.03,1380.21, flood to neighboring countries which are now overwhelmed
1380.39,1384.53, lebanon cost over a million syrian refugees
1384.74,1392.63, that in perspective that would be the equivalent of america taking in sixty four million syrian refugees
1392.93,1397.19, another sort of so called front line countries are equally overwhelmed
1397.49,1398.96, a number to think about
1399.35,1401.18, our nations
1401.24,1406.79, averaged per capita of about three thousand dollars
1407.0,1410.39, posting percent of the world's refugees
1410.51,1414.86, by comparison thirty four thousand six hundred
1414.95,1417.59, ten times canada
1418.16,1424.31, now accepted more than syrian refugees in the past months pledged to accept even more
1424.67,1432.8, i support creating safe sons in syria i hope this effort at the militarizing or bringing peace to syria prevails
1433.07,1435.38, we need to protect the victims of war
1435.53,1436.76, country
1436.79,1439.97, so there the burden on front lane nations
1440.6,1444.2, the third action a president can take on her own
1444.2,1447.14, break america's immigration reform stalemate
1447.14,1451.4, to help ease a desperate refuge crisis in our own hemisphere
1451.73,1459.41, tens of thousands of children and families fleeing widespread horrific violence and salvador honduras and guatemala
1459.59,1467.72, northern triangle has some of the highest homicide rates highest child murder ate highest female homicide rates and the world
1468.02,1470.78, gangs and drug cartels dominate
1471.05,1477.38, strongly opposed to immigration raids targeting mothers and children who left everything behind

1494.78,1500.84, don't deter terrified mothers and children from fleeing life threatening violence in their homeland
1501.11,1502.7, that some people
1502.85,1507.23, forcibly returned to the northern triangle from the united states have been killed
1507.38,1509.93, just days after their deportations
1510.14,1519.62, recently let a letter to the president from democratic senators asking the administration to stop deportations a vulnerable persons from northern triangle
1519.62,1523.67, they have no criminal record and if they were not represented by counsel
1523.91,1532.19, next president should use her clear statutory authority to bring a temporary protected status to recent arrivals from the northern triangle
1532.37,1544.94, protected status tops would protect children and adults from being returned to dangerous conditions at even life threatening situations how can we ask our allies in the middle east in europe
1545.0,1552.53, keep their borders open to syrian refugees if we return desperate children and parents and our own lawyers
1552.56,1554.93, and lethal violence
1555.17,1563.06, from the next administration guaranteeing refugees from the northern tringle refuge from harm and fair representation in court

2066.67,2081.76, egerton regional reporter for the hispanic outlook when he to ask you about the dreamers to that also include the children of temporary visa holders or is it only for the children who are here illegally
2083.8,2115.84, you know the answer to that door i tried i don't know then joe were eaten a year asking about the tackles ation you're i'm treated that dreamers in your dream i just like enclosed also children who are here under temporary visas whom who may graduate is valid victorian but they don't get a pathway to citizenship with someone who's here leather

2125.98,2130.3, part of the dreamer's program i'm kind of the university 
2130.33,2137.26, children a part of the dreamer's program of universities and institutions are they
2137.38,2143.41, the opportunity to attend on and many of these universities don't publicize it
2143.59,2146.53, they give example
2146.71,2151.15, the stretch college of medicine lowliest in chicago
2151.3,2156.55, to allow dreamers to compete for admission
2156.79,2158.11, the medical school
2158.41,2161.2, many of them this is the first opening ever
2161.29,2163.12, for them to compete
2163.42,2167.71, them are now dreamers or now in the medical school
2167.74,2171.19, don't they don't get any help from the government being un documented
2171.19,2221.62, but they have a program that if they will pledge a year of service to illinois after the graduated from medical school they'll forgive the expenses for a year and eventually further entire education i've called other universities in my state harmamithres to intellectual freshening now and in the ascent but i could not afford to go there but my parents police officers and the new york police department my mom's going back to work so she can afford to put me now through public college a very nominal to a sincere
2221.68,2237.52, some of the places i was accepted into and when we were talking on the panels before about why immigration has become such a hot topic in this election and why donald trump spread eric is resonating which so many americans
2237.55,2245.08, for me it's not a question i mean i grew up in a very middle class neighborhood where
2245.47,2254.02, we were poor enough to get full tuition to the universities of subsiding but we were by no means
2254.02,2268.45, richard to be able to afford the one on so when we're wondering why there is such senate does running through our nation for me i'm not someone who supports donald trump
2268.69,2274.66, saying that i agree with his policies whatsoever but it's not a question for me
2274.66,2275.62, because
2275.65,2287.95, one of the other patrols who sang as well how in middle america you know there's this view that immigrants are coming into our nation and taking our jobs so i didn't know if you had any response to that
2287.98,2352.09, if you for what you said because i really think to put the finger on it a base on your family and life experience the uncertainty about your future for your going to be going to school and i'm sure your parents are sharing it with you because they want you to succeed and they listen to the politicians they might listen my speech and said wait a minute what about my daughter you know she's not here legally she's here legally why wouldn't she get the first chance i don't think it is a matter of choice here between fairness to the dreamers and fairness to you as well we really lost our side as a nation if we reach that point the number of people were talking about here relatively small percentagewise in terms of the impact on higher education i think they are specially morvale and will be very successful in school and in life are viewed
2352.21,2400.48, the first one if you're admitted and you just mentioned new york university and the challenge a face it's really shortsighted as a nation to think that this is a static pool of opportunity i think it's an expanding poor and should be to include you as well as those who are withersteen you to quickly state their pointer their question quickly and then if you have a moment one responded
2400.48,2439.12, my name is no crawford i'm business owner from state in a christian early learning center for the last years i served about an regalis from wanda brunegghorn the next four days onomatopoeia
2439.51,2449.59, what if there is anything that you might suggest that i could utilize as a resource so that i when i go into this hearing can approach it from
2449.83,2456.43, this perspective because i served the whole community but my largest
2457.03,2462.16, immigrants do you think most of the immigrant families are documented
2462.16,2479.77, no they are actually come through catholic social services i'm partners with them in my state and we are the primary for my community they come through my early learning center before they are moved outward for early learning caroche i would say if i were in your shoes if the choice is to
2479.89,2486.28, someone who is legally in america and can work but needs a safe they are
2486.28,2496.39, as for their children during the day if the choice is so whether they should work or stay home we want to work right and to help our country and to pay taxes and to be part of it
2496.45,2503.38, making sure the kids have a safe place to stay and should be part of the equation that to me just makes eminent sense
2503.53,2505.78, good luck thanks for on
2507.94,2527.8, thank you so much for being here in all your work in behalf of emigration reform do you have any suggestions for us advocates who want immigration reform to work with people who are on the other side and he convince the especially your colleagues in congress
2527.95,2544.54, best arguments be and how can we best address the blockages as constituent as people care thank you very much thank you there was fellowcitizens was around washington for a long time and he worked for president lindens
2544.54,2556.42, eventually became the lobbyist for the motion picture association he was a pretty big deal and a very interesting guy and he is to say every speech should include six words
2556.78,2557.98, six words
2558.46,2562.69, tell you a story okay
2563.26,2584.83, the reason that he said that was that people hate speeches but they like stories okay in what i have found when i was arguing for the affordable care act against tea party folks standing in front of my office in the street with television cameras going i would just say well what about the sounds upon lincoln in here miles away you know what happened to her
2584.95,2593.98, finally reach a point ten minutes into this where they started saying stop telling stories we don't want to hear any more stories i tell stories about dreamers
2594.07,2600.58, the floor until stories about dreamers cable hutcheson a very conservative texas republican senator
2600.67,2604.78, to me one day out of the blue and said i want to talk to you about how we're going to pass the dream act
2604.93,2617.41, of it well they could vote for it and so we went through all the different things that were on her mind and her staff or she would turn to every once in a while and say o would that take care of maria
2618.07,2665.32, she had met a dreamer who made an impression on her the point i may continue in this this issue as much if not more than any other issue is a very personal issue an issue of stories i tell him on the senate floor you need to tell them to people as well why do you think that we have marriage equality in this country it's because more and more young people got to know people who were lesbian gay transcend and others and said why do we want to deny them this opportunity this exposure to real life people realize stories can bring even the hardest hearts around and i think that ultimately the beverages to tell thanks george
