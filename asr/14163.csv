0.03,62.13, the stars at night they shine so bright i everybody jeremy her coming to you from san angelo texas and matthew airport i realize that it's been over a month since i've shot an episode and so hopefully i'll i'll get back to to doing these things on a semi weekly basis cameras obligations
62.25,124.11, more for a college based audience and this audience definitely skewed older than college and so you know my section of the presentation here i give advice and the things i've learned in my career and that kind of stuff not exactly sure how relevant that was but as i think it was pretty well thinned wittgenstein
124.14,134.85, hash tag at the beginning i had a hash tag at the beginning of my presentation where i said you know if you want to participate in the back channel
135.0,138.57, during the presentation you can pass he a
138.6,155.76, during the presentation well i don't think that there were enough people who actually were on twitter or actually actively used twitter to really have any sort of dialogue so as an experiment there was kind of a noise it really never started
155.82,187.77, it was an idea it seemed pretty natural to me but i just hadn't hadn't reached any sort of saturation here that would make it meaningful you know as far as a lot of the mobile things that i talked about all that afterwards i had people coming up to me and were saying you know we knew about all these things but we would never really put it all together that you could put these things there they of fashions and
187.83,233.25, and of course the big thing that they said then was well but you know an angel is he such a smaller town you know we're not a big city like camstane don't have these big clients and so what what is this for you what does this mean for us and so really the first thing aikeambenanos they could go their clients plan for you egotistically
233.85,262.38, may not ever benefit from a social for a social media platform but there are brands and there are clients here in this part of texas and all over the nation and the world that may not today need these types of things as they beethoven
264.6,280.83, another interesting thing the kind of came out of today was one of my slides in my presentation i talk about cinches a japanese word which roughly means continuous improvement
280.83,304.65, an english and my point is it's during my it during my advice portion for for college students that i don't necessarily know flew over so well but it talks about always really trying to continuously improve an idea not resting on your laurels you know ongoloo
304.71,487.53, and the way you keep these things from expiring is continuously improving ideas continuously finding new ideas and so there was i was talking about that so something interesting that i learned was yesterday when i was traveling in tow there was a college guy and he was flying to try to become a intransigente was showing me that you were trying to get the ashavahista half mile away you know it's just one of those things knowingness and millions of dollars no househunting piece of treason the first place that three to four hundred thousand dollars to trot a plane with these gestures over the wings the air wants to kind of flow over the wing tips in this direction and if you add the ingathering drag therefore reducing fuel consumption therefore reducing possible and so they that this three hertfordshire lineaments
