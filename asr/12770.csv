5.73,13.11, weekly date from the christianity to day some years back i subscribe to that thought on his kind like a
13.11,28.14, with what was in the news from a christian standpoint christian perspective this week it was an interesting article that caught my eye they posted or article on line about the fifty countries in which it is most difficult to be a christian
28.53,39.0, i owe look around the world today and we think about how difficult it is to take the name of christ and claim to be a follower of his
39.15,44.94, all of us could lift off probably a handful of country where we would automatically think
45.0,46.89, to be on that list of 
47.13,62.4, it's becoming more and more difficult it was reporting on actually they were reporting in the article on the fact that open doors were leased their latest world watch list on wednesday of this week and they said that two thousand fourteen has been the worst
63.39,66.21, of christians in the modern era
66.72,79.8, how they define the modern era i don't know if that goes back to horse buggy days of the automobile or or how far back they go but in the modern era they said it two thousand fourteen was the worst year ever
80.28,101.67, it was not all because the violence against christians and churches certainly there's been a lot of that a lot of christians of the killed a lot of churches have been burned that doesn't mean there is no violence in fact world watch monitors researchers calculated there were i think it was i have the number here for and christians killed last year
101.88,104.67, faith based reasons
104.82,108.75, a double the amount in thirteen
108.75,112.59, more than triple the amount from 
112.86,115.83, so it has escalated incredibly
116.52,122.28, it's easy to understand why the list is topped by countries like north korea
122.7,123.81, a
124.65,125.67, i
126.06,142.89, syria and afghanistan and that order is pretty easy to understand why those are there three of those are middle eastern countries which open doors as christians have fled from its result of isis in fact there are only a very small remnant of christians left in any of those countries
143.13,151.23, iran pakistan and ideals made the top ten what was a little surprising to the analyst at nigeria population
151.5,153.6, about percent christian
154.32,166.74, for them to say that this is one of the top countries where it was most dangerous or you are most persecuted for being a christian seemed a little difficult for them to fathom and figure out
167.64,176.28, i read as i read though the article was finally concluded that it was the brutal attacks by bokhara that pushed it up into the top ten
176.55,180.99, then of other difficulty in nigeria as well
181.14,189.48, also seemed surprised a writer for christianity the is a conclusion from open doors that cultural marginal ization
190.35,226.5, but cultural margin ization being marginalis mainly because of the culture that that was a main factor in the increase of persecution of christians in two thousand and fourteen let me share two short paragraphs with their article and will wet on with hangers requote says when it wasn't increased violence that primarily drove persecution to record levels into thousand fourteen but rather increased cultural marazion according to open doors in other words the more subtle squeeze dimensions of persecution that make daily life harder and harder for christians
226.86,239.01, a study by the pew research center found that nearly percent of the world's population now lives in countries with high levels of social hostility involving religion
239.76,244.62, even christian majority states are experiencing unprecedented levels
244.62,250.65, exclusion discrimination and violence that david curry president in cope doors he 
250.74,256.86, the two thousand fifteen world watch list reveals that his sagging number of christians are becoming victims
256.86,259.17, intolerance and violence
259.17,260.82, because of their faith
261.09,265.44, being forced to be more secretive about their faith
267.24,269.46, thinking
269.58,275.19, the last couple of weeks about m frank bestud had winter family weekend
275.37,277.83, titled the destruction of godliness
278.46,299.01, if i don't do no one friday night during one family weekend for that ere and watch the reply it's posted i posted it this week along with mister cardlestone sermon page of the member in sight this week and mister franks mentioned it in his letter but i found it very very interesting and thought provoking for me
299.31,312.24, but the destruction of godliness in our society how it is becoming more and more common for people to integrate anything that has to do with godliness
313.08,325.74, something that we as christians face in watching what's happening in our own nation i would contend that cultural marginal ization as open doors calls it is happening to us right here
325.89,327.06, country
327.33,328.83, the united states
329.28,331.95, nation on an unprecedented scale
333.15,336.3, it's very very much alive
336.42,339.51, things we see as in direct
340.68,347.01, things that we see as god's direct revelation in the bible are being ignored at an increasing rate
347.88,357.48, more people are ignoring that and those who are trying to follow a biblical guidance or increasingly ridicule labeled as haters and carrying and bigots
357.81,362.46, and that doesn't just include us i realize there are other lads there are some other
362.46,368.73, conservative christian groups who share our views at least in part in order experiencing that same large all ization
369.21,375.6, throwing me to john fifteen because jesus warned that we really shouldn't be surprised at this
381.63,391.47, of course this was near the time of crucifixion jesus knew his time was limited and john chapter fifteen
391.83,394.59, some of the final words that he
395.28,398.4, smoke or taught to his disciples
398.46,406.11, they get up there john fifteen a burthen if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you
406.59,413.88, if you were of the world the world would love its own yet because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you
414.87,418.41, the world hates you now remember the word in greek
418.44,419.76, word for hate
420.06,432.6, miss or miss it's the same one that used in luke chapter fourteen of us twenty six i'm not going to turn there but it's where jesus christ said if you want to be a follower if you want to be a disciple of mine
432.75,436.95, to have your father mother brother sister wife
438.09,439.53, your own life
439.83,441.87, you can't be my disciple
442.14,468.24, we've always explained that by saying this greek word mesel really is a comparative word it means love less by comparison doesn't mean we actively have hatred or feelings of ill will toward those people that he listed in the name of in that list but that by comparison we love them less than we love god we put god first in our life he said unless you do that you can't be my disciple
468.24,474.93, no one since saying the same thing here are the world loves us less very much less
475.41,479.67, not the world's best friends when we believe the bible
480.27,486.03, we follow the bible when we tried to live by the bible when we look to the bible for guidance and direction
487.08,493.2, we believe it over the railing the prevailing sentiments of our society were not the world best friend
494.16,508.05, we live in one sense a very blessed part of the country because in the bible belt as they called the southern part of the country we find there are higher percentage of people who have a little bit more affinity for the bible
508.8,513.03, and we find that our community around this part of the
513.3,516.87, at that there's a bit of conservatism
517.2,519.69, and in this part of the country
520.26,528.66, was continuing says in verse one remember the words that i said to you a servant is not greater than his master if they persecuted me though also persecute you
529.2,534.99, he kept my word they will keep yours also but all these things i will do to you for my namesake
535.23,538.02, cause he not know him who sent me
540.3,545.34, know him who sent me jesus prophesied that his followers would
545.34,546.81, experience
549.9,553.83, we continue with this a little bit further i guess i'll read as far as worse 
554.31,562.47, says i i comment if i had not come and spoken to them they would have no sin but now they have no excuse for their son he who hates me as my father also
563.22,571.11, not done among them the works and no one else did they would have no sin but now they have seen and also hated both me and my father
571.26,572.52, love less
575.55,576.87, less
577.68,587.37, jesus prophesied persecution the term cultural marginal ization is just a fancy way to describe in the twenty first century of being loved less
588.0,589.92, the persecution
591.18,593.07, not looking to us
594.69,601.62, being a part of society moralizing us if we accept the bible as god's enduring were
601.92,605.01, why is that because they don't know the father
605.88,616.26, they don't know the father they don't understand that it's a whole separate subject but it's a crucial part of the truth that jesus taught most of the religious world even though it really just world that calls itself by
616.41,621.63, i am don't really understand the father they all your sand the father and the son
622.68,630.42, confused about who god the father is and therefore their deceived about him jesus christ is because he said he and father unified there there one
632.76,644.28, the essence of what jesus said to philip and john fourteenth chapter earlier where he said how can you say shows the father if you see me you see the father and answer the same
644.85,652.98, the father and the old testament in me in the new testament it is with the moaner most world doesn't understand that even the christian era
653.16,661.8, what to talk to day about the bible if you're wondering where this is going to talk about the bible and why our approach to the bible
661.89,667.35, why excepting what god's word says and living our life
667.62,676.29, forming our opinions forming our world view based on god's word is emportant at so crucial
676.95,679.2, a very important
680.58,688.53, i said we live in a bible belt and because of that i think it's easy sometimes for us to can ourselves about what's really happening in the rest of the country
688.92,693.39, the country as a whole because they will be doesn't control the country
694.77,695.91, really doesn't
697.41,704.94, i believe we need to be reminded occasionally about how precious the written word of god is and how little is appreciated in our country
705.24,711.63, book the god preserve for us and he performs some incredible miracles over the centuries to preserve it
712.5,716.01, convinced that he was involved in the preservation of it
716.73,717.72, the
717.78,722.97, all the people that help preserve it recalled a salvation at this point
722.97,729.99, like there's any evidence of that the god uses all kinds of tools at different times to accomplish his will
730.2,737.43, and all kinds of lives i mean intervened in the life of navigation the case on never can answer was ever going to be converted
737.76,739.14, that life
741.21,743.49, directly involved in self and
743.55,745.86, razorlike
746.7,756.09, so let's look at this today why it's so important why would i say we as true christians a christ or being margined when we live in what is still considered a largely christian
757.11,768.24, but largely christian at least i am well the number of reasons if you follow national des its pretties to recognize some of them i'll start with one of the hot topics of our country today
768.57,769.92, things like marriage
770.34,779.61, that's a surprise to anybody that i would bring that topic up because it's been in the news and continues to be in the news there has been a constant
779.67,780.84, she
781.14,799.8, the gay lesbian trans gender all that is the good get all the acronym exupere has been a constant push toward legalizing same sex marriage and this week florida became the thirty six state in the us along with the district of columbia
800.28,804.75, they are legal things that marriage is not legal in the state of florida
805.17,816.12, yesterday i was looking at the news a little bit yesterday there are also reports about a federal appeals cord in new orleans deepened in the bible belt he was considering
816.24,818.73, arguments about
818.79,822.75, overturning the bands on same sex marriage in texas
823.02,825.09, in the pacific
825.81,829.71, a very deep liable bill says
830.61,837.96, the federal court is looking at overturning those bands at least hearing the arguments there is not a guarantee that overturn
838.89,840.96, quite possible 
844.29,850.26, the idea that deep in the bible belt marriage between a man and a woman that's been the foundation
850.26,856.8, heart of society has been seen as a foundational part of the city that the idea that it could be undermined is really shocking
856.92,862.92, yesterday is supreme court decided to take no action on five pending cases from other areas
863.43,867.48, i mean they still won't hear them during their current term they could
868.32,874.47, the rule like many other federal courts have done good possible in states being able to determine
875.01,881.01, they want to define as marriage supreme court could possibly do that
881.58,885.51, proponents of sane sex marriage they will is to fundamental right
885.78,887.31, individual
887.88,890.4, they deserve
890.46,895.23, be able to make up their minds what they want to do what they want to call a marriage
895.32,899.37, and the country has to accept it
899.37,902.25, tired of hearing deserve
902.31,903.33, it
905.58,913.5, many times those ideas of rights and what we deserve go contrary to the bible and certainly it does in this situation as well
914.22,927.96, upon us of an arguing that society has a vested interest marriage it has a vested interest at all as a whole than they have an interest in a being defined and how its defined since before the founding of our nation that's the way had been
927.99,929.91, one man and one woman
930.45,936.96, and they call all kinds of statistics about how much better off children are within intact nuclear family with a father and a mother
937.68,938.97, that doesn't
940.47,942.03, right
942.24,943.68, that you can't
943.71,945.09, discriminate
945.57,960.09, become something very different than what i believe our founding fathers felt those terms and those concepts were all about the most important word is god say about it since many don't want except the words of the old testament
960.57,973.8, the words of jesus christ before he came he became the soft god before he became the messiah a stage look at the new testament statement was to get something he said in matthew apparition and his is review for us i realized but
973.95,982.65, just shows how very different our perspective is if we focus our perspective and we live by what
982.86,987.75, bible says and we allow that to frame and shape our opinions
987.96,990.3, society how different we are
990.78,992.49, from society as a whole
993.0,1006.89, parminter tore the persica to investing him saying is it lawful for a man to the horse's wife for just any reason and he answered me said have you not read that he who made them at the beginning
1007.13,1009.98, made them male and female
1011.12,1026.48, a loaded question about the dissolution of marriage jesus christ of them back to the beginning to come back to the old testament said amen you read that i mean your teachers of the law as far sistered that's the way god made it from the very start
1028.55,1031.04, god's intent from the very beginning
1031.97,1033.98, made the male and female
1034.01,1039.59, for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife
1040.01,1043.04, the two shall become one flesh
1043.91,1046.16, then they are no longer to
1046.37,1052.13, one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
1052.46,1060.86, from the very beginning jesus is saying go back to the start starting point what was god's and dead from the very beginning it was man and
1060.86,1062.96, man and woman
1064.01,1068.51, a man and a woman a man to leave his father and mother not believe as to mothers
1068.6,1070.55, two fathers
1073.28,1078.98, pretty clear he molester and mother and be joined to his wife
1080.48,1083.36, it seems so obvious to us
1083.69,1086.33, if it's a woman
1086.9,1090.5, doesn't he want to look at christ statements for guidance on the topic
1092.15,1095.93, read statements like this and say well that was first century
1096.14,1102.26, that you know they didn't they didn't have all the sexual they didn't have some six concepts by them and we said
1103.07,1105.35, very much alive in the roman empire
1107.0,1108.5, very much alive
1109.34,1117.26, and those who have tried to bring the biblical view into the discussion and our country are dismissed as irrelevant that the matter
1117.26,1122.54, with the bible says that has no bearing on life in the twenty first century
1123.95,1127.16, brother for us a better i have therein on life
1127.46,1129.92, bearing on every part of our life
1130.1,1136.31, we boys said that this interaction was between men and and jesus the parsees not between women
1136.37,1144.05, asking to put away they're saying sex why something that's very clear anthropos men anthropos in one sense i can you look at
1144.08,1147.44, they say that word anthropos can mean
1147.44,1157.67, again being a gambling man can woman but you look at any of the other forms in the interlinear even say it's the masculine form for man
1158.18,1159.74, the feminine
1160.37,1163.49, a means a woman especially away
1164.69,1169.37, the interlinear are very clear that he is speaking about man
1169.37,1171.41, a female wife
1172.46,1183.02, actuality as i said was common in the roman world in the first century and certainly possible well aware of what was going on in society around them
1184.01,1187.46, specifically did not endorse it
1187.7,1195.2, in fact paul if we go to first corinthians chapter x we see that paul very very soundly
1195.98,1197.15, condemns it
1207.11,1214.34, was writing to the church at corinth and they were a part of the roman empire they were short they were of
1214.88,1225.17, none for all kinds of sexual immorality and their society was a part of their life that people there had grown up with and had witnessed
1226.1,1235.37, we find the first mention chapter six fort nine as paul right to him is he says do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god
1235.61,1237.05, it
1237.26,1240.44, well you know maybe god will
1241.1,1247.04, their heart and say well the heart good they really were faithful to whoever they
1247.25,1252.32, living with no eust very adamant very direct very state
1252.38,1256.88, very flat statement they will not inherit the kingdom of god
1257.96,1260.45, to see neither fornicators
1260.54,1271.88, no ulterior homosexuals nor sodomites nor these nor contessina drunkards the revilers nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of god
1272.63,1276.23, simply are not going to enter the kingdom
1277.34,1280.58, and when he sees a term homosexual
1281.51,1283.04, some
1284.18,1292.82, too graphic in this but he is really talking about both aspects of a male homosexual relationship the more passive one
1293.09,1294.5, the more aggressive one
1294.83,1296.81, terms up in
1296.96,1298.7, i
1298.82,1300.95, margin even makes that
1301.88,1303.2, you know a
1303.38,1308.72, very specific terms about homosexual relations
1308.75,1312.95, and he says very specifically they will not inherit
1314.03,1322.1, if someone what paul wrote and romans when he condemned those in society in the first century who ignored god ignored his instructions and
1322.16,1325.88, do they would decide for themselves what was right
1326.15,1327.83, they were wise
1328.04,1333.83, i mentioned women and women burning and sexual desire for one another and doing what he called shameful
1335.63,1337.4, this is god's perspective
1338.18,1340.61, what god has to say on the topic
1341.39,1343.55, now i will point out
1344.0,1348.02, the next verse shows the god forgives
1348.14,1351.56, people come to understand this is wrong
1351.59,1352.85, is not
1353.18,1354.23, right
1354.68,1356.3, the change
1357.05,1358.52, forgive
1359.21,1360.71, whether you're a thief
1361.43,1363.38, i didn't list
1363.65,1366.71, sexual sense as worse than any of the rest
1367.73,1375.26, they will keep the art of the king or god but if you repaired god forgives and you can be in god's kingdom
1375.86,1389.15, very clear because he says in verse eleven that such were some of you but your wash you were sanctified you are justified in the name lord jesus and by the spirit of our god so forgiveness is possible if you repent if you change
1391.1,1392.84, nor any
1392.99,1396.62, more evil in that sense than other sands
1398.06,1405.59, terms of life or death or being in god's kingdom or not being forgiven that can forgive any sent for gave
1406.07,1408.17, and with as
1408.77,1411.35, the murder for gave the adultery
1412.4,1414.35, so david repentance
1416.9,1418.94, we have to repent and change
1419.57,1427.16, so far as of to day it is still legal in this country to read these verses and teach the mean what they say
1427.19,1433.73, this is what god says this is what god's word says and if we want to let god's words
1433.91,1438.11, bible god instructions frame are thinking
1438.32,1442.61, illegal to say this is what our thinking should be
1442.88,1445.58, we want to have the mind of god
1446.9,1452.93, who say so are becoming more and more generalized and our society and looked on negatively
1453.8,1457.31, i realize again there are people
1457.46,1462.2, who are in that kind of life style who can be very nice people
1462.77,1466.16, steingall evil and horrible people
1466.79,1471.05, what god just like thieves those who are drunkards
1471.47,1476.84, those who are in any of these other things that he mentions god wants them to repent and change
1476.87,1479.12, give them life and his family
1480.83,1497.99, only one topic there are some others were a couple of others in this week's christianity today electronic news letter this was one that another one that caught my eye another way in which christians are being marginalis this one the title is bible citation cost at lantimeche his job
1498.53,1510.71, i won't read all the details of it it was a rather involved article but in two thousand thirteen just to give you the cliff note version atlantis fire she self published a christian book
1511.55,1527.78, now he is a deacon in one of the manacures i think is a baptist make a church and he mentioned it was a book aimed at men and he mentioned in the book that it was his belief that sex was designed by god for a man and a woman i just read the matter nineteen
1528.14,1533.93, a fire chief of the year veteran of many fire departments
1534.38,1542.18, and as i said a deacon in a negatron baptist manacure he was suspended for thirty days and then that week he was fired
1542.6,1544.91, mayor and talking about his
1545.75,1555.44, fachinetti the far chief book he said well you know his views or his belief on homes homosexuality or inconsistent with the work of the city
1556.1,1558.08, they don't fit in with
1558.35,1559.52, at
1560.45,1561.98, and wants
1561.98,1565.79, do according to the christianity to day article
1566.57,1567.86, and these are
1568.46,1570.65, century examples
1570.86,1572.06, how
1572.24,1581.54, don't fit in if you follow god's word were becoming or in more marginalis french people
1581.57,1583.82, lines of society
1584.06,1589.25, for going to see godliness as mister frank described his bible study
1589.34,1596.36, oh as to be a compromise cannot be i mean a compromise it has to be based on the word of god not a compromise of it
1597.2,1598.82, to be based on that
1600.95,1607.64, we look around and say well we're better than the world around us we don't look as bad as them that's not doesn't say anything
1607.64,1619.46, we look like god we look like what god is telling us to do or reisach that way here's another article almost spent a lot of time on this one but this article i says why you don't need to read the whole bible
1620.09,1621.23, you know i
1623.84,1631.4, little the lady she has some ideas about this that she said you know it's beginning of the year and many people make this
1632.57,1652.43, resolution that one of the very real bible too and then they get to the book of leviticus and they fall off the wagon that it's hard to read and so her i mean her approach any reading of the bible is good i'll give her that if you can get people to read the book of salvage a rathole
1652.7,1653.9, that's good
1654.14,1662.72, in the church of god we would disagree with that we would say no all of god's word he turned the first semitic three
1662.81,1667.64, say we don't want to just read parts of the bible we want to read all of the bible
1668.36,1671.03, just parts that are inspired by god
1675.32,1679.76, because some books or maybe a little more difficult to understand
1680.18,1683.42, prophetic books of the fact prophetic statements
1683.51,1689.75, the beats and in those are awfully boring but there there for a reason god
1689.99,1696.74, and his blood for a reason and they can help us track and trace a people and nations and groups of people
1697.31,1707.48, we don't want to do things just because they are a little difficult to understand why because of what we find in second timothy chapter three for sixteen says all scripture not part
1707.57,1713.81, most but ninety per cent but all all scripture is given by inspiration of god
1713.87,1720.29, flor doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete
1721.46,1727.61, not in complaint because we only are parts of the bible but complete that we can be the complete package
1728.72,1732.41, can be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work
1733.04,1742.43, most of us who were adults in the church have this passage committed to memory because we recognize this as a very important package that tell our or passage that tells us
1742.43,1745.64, or that all of god's word is inspired
1746.9,1749.51, this inspired book
1751.01,1758.39, and if we don't understand it if there's something we don't understand them we ought to have the attitude of the the opening of unicorn with me to a chapter
1758.9,1767.9, you might remember this passage probably will when i turned there and read a little bit and but philip had been ordained a deacon several
1768.11,1773.24, prior to this and philip went and began preaching different areas about
1773.39,1775.76, jesus christ being the messiah
1776.42,1780.8, was explaining to many of the jews at that first century that
1781.13,1787.4, jesus was the one that they had been looking for and that they had killed him that they had crucified the masai
1787.58,1796.79, and as he went from jerusalem he was going to some the villages of the samaria it says in verse twenty five
1796.88,1806.24, an angel of the lord spoke to him and told him go down toward gaza its desert down there and he went he saw this man from ethiopia
1806.36,1808.31, as he was
1808.73,1811.94, a man of great authority for says
1812.3,1815.63, he was sitting in his chariot and he was reading i 
1815.63,1824.24, i said to philip and burst twenty nine go near overtake the chariot philip ran to him and he heard him reading and the profit i say and he said you understand what you're reading
1825.59,1844.67, the bees know the sand or whatever passage it was that he was reading actually is an eisenstadt many say well how can i unless someone guidman asked philip to come up and sit with him look i don't understand this if you understand it yes i'm sure help me with this i want to know what this means
1845.96,1850.13, he approached and if it's hard to understand we want to get help
1850.25,1855.92, understand what this part of gods were means but what it mean for me how do i apply this to my life
1855.92,1860.66, learn from this invited philip into his chariot to learn
1860.9,1868.61, will turned chapter seventeen but the britons are praised there called more noble for searching the scriptures daily to understand
1868.64,1870.5, what the impossibles taught
1873.05,1878.72, again there are many other examples we could bring we can talk about but the different ways in which we
1878.78,1884.54, believe in the bible and who look to the bible for our direction for our guidance in our every day life
1884.6,1893.24, more and more agonized or go back to second timothy chapter three listing low closer look at this passage paul was writing to timothy
1893.72,1898.28, but carter and how important scripture is he was writing to timothy
1898.31,1901.79, talked about the in times being a perilous time
1902.21,1910.13, and for come i won't read all of the details that he mentions in the first part of the chapter about perilous times at the end
1910.19,1912.77, he mentions those specifics
1913.82,1920.0, people in general would be like he turns to warning timothy about false teachers
1920.03,1923.84, the going to be all kinds of false teachers in the time as well
1924.59,1926.87, they're going to be very prolific
1926.87,1928.91, they may have all kinds of knowledge
1929.33,1935.27, ever learning as he says in one passage and never coming to the truth
1935.81,1940.13, always learning lots of knowledge that there espousing
1940.55,1945.11, really isn't true it doesn't bring you to god's truth
1946.79,1949.76, yes about that in the last days
1950.78,1954.92, think there's any way paul could have anticipated the growth of the internet
1955.25,1960.8, how that would allow anybody to set themselves up and authority on god's word
1961.91,1965.0, just simply was inspired to say this is what's going to happen
1965.39,1967.97, we've seen that happen to day
1968.9,1971.03, exactly what's happened in the approach
1971.06,1977.54, many of these last days and setting drawn away by those individuals who hold themselves out
1977.54,1980.75, a great knowledge here's what paul advised timothy
1980.87,1983.72, the cat up in verse fourteen he says but you
1984.26,1996.92, to be able men they're going to do worse and worse to seeing and being deceived as what you said emerson to that he said don't go that direction but you ersten must continue in the things you have learned and men assured us
1996.98,2006.91, knowing from whom you've learned them in a few verses prior to that he said you followed my life you know what you know what i taught you you know the kind of life i've led you witnessed it
2007.06,2014.92, and you know the problem in all kinds of difficult as a result of living as a follower of jesus christ
2014.92,2017.77, even the first century had difficulty with that
2018.46,2024.13, saying stick with what you know stick with what you have learned from me you trusted
2026.74,2033.46, continue in those things you've learned in miniature of knowing from whom you've learned them and that from childhood you've known the holy scriptures
2033.94,2043.81, able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus allaraine him his mother and his grandmother and he said they they taught you the scriptures
2043.93,2050.86, good examples of looking to god's word for guidance and direction they were good source of godly information
2051.19,2054.67, including himself as a servant of god
2054.7,2056.56, it gospel
2056.83,2059.53, led to a lot of persecution for paul
2060.04,2062.47, a very difficult life
2062.47,2064.96, this dedication the god's truth
2065.74,2069.52, said to stick with that and with the holy scriptures
2070.15,2078.16, needed those for salvation also needed faith in jesus christ as his saviour that he was the promised beside
2078.79,2080.89, and even
2081.19,2093.79, he says all scripture is given by inspiration is profitable for doctrine reproof correction and instruction and right righteousness we read these before now that we have them in contact or tinman a few more minutes here to focus on
2093.85,2095.56, these words mean
2096.34,2106.84, here what are these words literally it this is all scripture is given by inspiration of god literally it means god breathed or breathed an by god and has his market has his imprint
2107.35,2109.42, god word good for
2109.78,2117.58, what do we here we find even the less exciting part peeps or whatever we consider less exciting in the bible
2117.85,2119.5, what's it good for
2119.5,2121.27, benefit
2121.84,2122.74, that
2123.25,2139.78, these are the four things that paul mentions which leads to spiritual maturity in the good works which he mentions the first seventeen the sakoontala try to be relatively quick and covering these all scripture said over sixteen is given inspiration is profitable for first of all doctrine
2141.07,2143.56, profitable for doctrine
2144.43,2147.88, doctrine turn with me to romans chapter torpor
2149.11,2154.69, after inverforth greek word for doctrine simply means teaching
2156.16,2157.6, instruction
2158.02,2160.51, as after fifteen a burst for
2161.29,2170.35, asses for whatever things were written before paul's writing this in the new testament time the old testament and already been preserved
2170.77,2173.74, that was codified it was complete
2174.25,2176.8, things that were written before
2176.83,2179.08, written for our learning
2179.11,2185.2, a word that is sometimes translated as doctrine it for our learning afforestation for our teaching
2185.95,2188.26, the way through
2188.29,2197.65, patience and comfort of the scriptures may have hoped so it is to give us hope as well but it's there for learning is therefore teaching is therefore our instruction
2198.16,2199.99, we're told to learn from that
2200.83,2205.78, not to experiment in life to see what we believe is good and what's bad
2205.96,2212.08, ay too many people done that they lived their life experimenting with everything they can think of
2212.74,2217.96, a lot of horrible things and they pay the consequences of those things that they
2218.2,2220.69, experiment with which are bad
2222.55,2226.75, much better in life to avoid the bad things
2226.81,2229.84, not have to suffer the consequences
2230.86,2233.38, after all
2233.65,2240.64, indicates that we need to stick with sound and teaching not to be swept away with
2240.79,2243.82, clever arguments
2244.84,2248.47, as that part of why god has established
2248.77,2254.68, he has with the new church with a possible profits of angel's pastors teachers derselben
2257.23,2268.63, all of this is for the unifying of the body of christ and bursten that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men and their cunning craftiness
2268.84,2271.36, and this deceitful plotting
2271.66,2276.04, speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things that the wise head christ
2277.09,2279.67, encouraging sticking with sound doctrine
2279.73,2283.0, should be made the basis for everything we believe
2283.63,2284.62, thing
2285.43,2286.84, as anything
2286.84,2288.4, spiritual life
2289.03,2294.97, what god and specifically his word the bible says on a subject is ultimately the only thing that matters
2295.18,2298.51, well i can believe that person doesn't really hurt
2299.02,2300.88, a hurt by that
2301.96,2304.24, i can believe that all i want
2304.69,2310.9, even convince myself it's okay with god call myself a christian but the third commandment tells very clearly
2314.05,2316.03, what god is
2318.4,2322.48, i believe god and let that form and shape
2323.2,2325.27, on my actions
2325.6,2327.28, decide for myself
2328.09,2331.18, that's not gotten mankind very far
2331.99,2339.55, the second one we quickly and second mate but with something there in back and forth the second one that's mentioned
2339.97,2342.67, as for reproof
2343.6,2346.48, he seems a little negative to us doesn't it
2346.48,2348.19, for reproof
2349.03,2350.74, negative and corrective
2352.45,2354.76, translate the greek word
2355.15,2365.14, but it's not the only place or rather it is the only place in peru it's not the only thing that word means in fact it comes from a word that literally means fiction
2365.92,2366.91, fiction
2367.57,2373.54, translation says every writing is god breathed and profitable for teaching and for
2374.5,2376.93, the whole discussion that goes on about
2377.38,2383.05, reference versus the fiction i have a preference for the kind of chocolate i like
2385.45,2389.05, the other kind of chocolate to
2389.35,2396.37, chocolate and assented you do that for well the preference of mine
2396.7,2398.05, not a conviction
2398.23,2403.66, on the other hand i am convicted of things i'm convicted of things i read in the bible sabbath
2403.9,2409.21, god set apart for worship of him from the beginning of creation i convicted of that
2409.72,2411.79, my life based on that
2412.45,2413.62, a conviction
2414.67,2419.62, he both played sports and high school and we were faith with fate with 
2419.68,2422.5, whether we were going to stick with that conviction or not
2423.82,2425.74, something we all have to deal with
2426.64,2430.48, we slip we make mistakes god young god forgives
2431.8,2436.93, we had to decide what we're going to do came to one point when our
2437.08,2438.82, as
2438.88,2448.6, to state championship play off game both with desperately looking for some way that he could get special dispensation for it for that one day just that one at
2448.72,2450.67, doesn't work that way
2452.65,2470.44, conviction is important i really like this quote about conviction of something that's a corbeling we have to be personally convicted of things i like to quote it as a conviction is rooted in the conscience and cannot be changed without changing that which essentially defines the person
2472.48,2475.78, it is so deeply held that it
2475.81,2481.15, define the person that's what a conviction is we got a lot of bible heroes have all kinds of
2481.54,2483.67, examples of that in the bible
2484.42,2487.33, point that is mentioned a second time of the 
2487.84,2490.42, for for correction
2490.45,2496.12, that literally is correct in most of us don't like correction we don't like to be told were wrong we like the
2496.18,2504.31, to right the mollie we like to believe were right and most time we do believe were right whether we are not profit
2506.02,2515.62, correction of something all of us made the greek the word simply means straightening up that we've been a little bit one way or the other and we need to get straightened up
2516.76,2518.71, the word correction means
2519.97,2525.13, glass it's a restoration to an upright or a right state
2525.4,2528.28, proverbs proverbs in a burst
2529.75,2531.7, roberts in numbers
2534.52,2536.83, contrast between
2537.07,2538.63, his person
2539.2,2540.7, some one who's not
2541.09,2542.92, proper niners
2543.13,2545.8, correct the scoffer let's see he
2547.24,2552.28, contrast to that is this statement rebuke a wise man and willowy
2554.26,2561.01, correction to someone who's a scoffer and they're not going to like you very much there they're going to be pretty negative towards you
2561.46,2568.42, esme one whose wife and i'll say oh i didn't realize i was off faster and let lament
2569.11,2570.43, appreciate
2570.58,2572.02, that you gave them
2573.19,2574.36, correction
2574.51,2577.6, sarvent three
2577.93,2579.85, bertie
2582.61,2595.81, in verse says do not speak in the hearing of a fool for he will despise the wisdom of your words the commentaries were saying this has to do with correcting some one that some one who doesn't want the correction
2596.14,2598.42, you stand your work your wasting breath
2599.29,2601.21, if they're not open to it
2601.51,2603.43, not going to help them
2605.11,2607.84, we need to be people who want to be
2607.93,2612.13, given direction and we've got to be open to god's word giving a direction
2612.82,2615.64, at one second timycha er three
2616.0,2620.32, as also for instruction in righteousness
2620.71,2625.78, and righteousness sometimes people think righteousness of boring
2626.5,2630.4, to be godly that's got to be boring
2631.18,2638.68, excitement i want to do sunthin in life well who says being godly can't be fun
2639.94,2642.19, so many people have that perspective
2643.84,2655.84, people see that that's not god's perspective that obeying him doesn't lead to bad things but it leads to good things a couple of quick passages to roomy chapter thirty
2656.44,2672.28, this is one we probably all again are familiar with probably many of us have memorized this but doing onycha ter thirty first nineteen even dealing with ancient israel god made the statement that if you will obey things will be good you'll be blessed
2673.24,2674.74, bring
2674.95,2677.44, be blessed is it i don't think so
2677.59,2680.62, wonderful to be blessed and exciting to be blessed
2681.73,2695.41, and so i call heaven and earth to witness to day against you that i said before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life god not in bible i want you to be blessed i want you to choose life
2696.61,2707.23, you and your descendants may live that you may love the lord your god that you may be his voice that you may cling to him for he is your life and the length of your days
2707.32,2712.93, you may dwell in the land which the lord sware to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob to give to them
2713.53,2716.5, desire is for us to have a good life
2716.83,2719.77, an exciting life
2719.83,2722.65, the life beyond this physical life
2723.07,2732.82, with blessings and ultimately great blessings first simply chapter four in the new testament the first mister franks read
2733.18,2736.36, talking about godliness and his bible study
2738.01,2751.36, a little fun at those of us who don't exercise every day in that game play a alibaba kemball and winter family weekend three days out of the year and really be in great physical shape
2751.36,2753.85, and he's right can't do it just then
2754.24,2762.67, i verses for some of the approvers for bodily exercise profits little a little or some translation say for a little while
2763.48,2770.29, you get off your training routine and you're quite exercising a kind of disappears in a hurry if you're not careful
2770.53,2777.85, the profits for a little while but godliness here in contrast to that godliness is profitable for all things
2778.18,2782.83, i promised for the life that now is and of that which is to come
2783.13,2793.78, it brings blessings now brings peace of mind it brings blessings for knowing that your basing your ideas in your views of life in your world view on god's views
2793.87,2796.42, your coming and think with god's thinking
2797.26,2800.65, there's a tremendous peace that comes from knowing that
2801.73,2805.24, it will be tried tested on that
2805.63,2809.47, great peace and knowing that there the blessing their blessings
2809.77,2813.67, now in this life and ultimately for the life to come eternal life
2814.0,2816.04, that's a blessing beyond
2817.03,2818.68, i understand
2819.28,2821.23, beyond what we can understand
2822.67,2829.33, now i didn't get into the details of how the bible was preserved and that's a whole nother discussion
2829.87,2849.25, he preserved his work he wants this word he wanted it preserved he did not want mankind to be able to stamp it out and i believe he was directly involved in making sure that it wasn't my personal belief if you want some details on how we know the bible is true that whole section on life open truth website if you cared to refuse some of those
2849.49,2852.58, articles are doubled to the curacy of the bible
