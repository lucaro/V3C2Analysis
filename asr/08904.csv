0.03,65.67, hello i'm david like her i am a tilemaker in an active director of photography based here in new york and i'm here in behalf of bench to discuss cannons sentiment is family of cameras were going to do this in five parts the first part will be an introduction where oriel go over each of the cameras the second part will be a look at de capture in recording using the sea one hundred and the sea three hundred the third part will be about four and two cables aged capture in recording using the sea five hundred and the one dechert part will be about centimeters in the fifth part will be about the universe of lenses that are available for these cameras that would be if lenses slane's cannon cineres super thirty five lines now before we get started i'd like to
65.91,87.57, frame this discussion by looking at two legacies that are brought together in this family of cameras one would be motion pictures and the other would be canons on io's technology cinema of course came first motion pictures began with the introduction in eighteen ninety two one in three eight inch motion picture film
87.63,90.45, for her it viameter
90.66,122.37, and with a frame that today we call superduper is a legacy format now in the nineteen eighties coat looked thirty five millimetre to determine how much digital resolution would be necessary to capture everything on a thirty five millimeter color negative to a digital format and they came up with four thousand ninety six pickles and other words four cabesterre forecome from now sentiment is is
122.4,130.77, derivative of so is a retractile system and cannon introduced that in nineteen sixty seven
131.04,152.13, auto focus and millimeters as prior to that lenses had had mechanical linkages to cameras to sellars the system brought electrical contacts which were used instead of mechanical linkages to operate lensless to be smaller and electronically controlled
152.31,215.04, which gave rise to to day's universe of islands which we now can use for acquisition as well as force acquisition so let's review the cinnamon is family of cameras the sea one hundred which is right here the sea three hundred the sea five hundred and the ones there based on two platforms the first is an innovative lightweight camporese using madula design its foot cannon calls there mobile core design and the second platform is a dear platform come back to this in a moment these three cameras are distinguished by system modality for instance this handgrip fits on to both the sea three hundred in the sea one hundred by attaching at this point and it attaches to both of them it's the same handgrip it's an intelligent hand ribas a start stop and button in the front it has an irish control button
215.37,228.96, the index finger it has a joyce taken the back in it has a magnification button to times the sea three hundred and the sea five hundred share a modeler elsie de
228.96,343.5, is an articulated for insects quite large it turns and all kinds of directions it's kind of like a transformer toy it attaches on top and it provides a hundred percent coverage of the image the sea five hundred in the sea the also come in a pale mount version they see one hundred is f mount only the three hundred and five hundred comment et or pale now features common to all three of these cameras include huston decision is a world wide reality far far more programming in the world at shotts days television movies commercial production than in any other format these cameras are also world can and that means that the function quality nine for a super thirty five samos censor with a point to million photos of thirty eight forty by twenty one sixty it's called ultra dthese days but it used to be known as quadroones for no discordant that is to say when you have to none and one blue potash per each pick from one thing there's no dear process you don't have to interpolate any color information secondly when you have two green potosi's peril that equal something that can and call super green and super green is twice the lima signal luminous the detail that we experience when we look at it at a video image it it corresponds to our perception of detail and sharpness well when you have two green pickels twice the green
343.77,380.7, two green houses in every pie you have a very high modulation transfer function very high empty zero leasing and the all important green channel it makes for a very clean image and a very sharp looking image now when you're shooting for there are eight point eight five million otasite available that would be forty ninety six by twenty one sixty in the safe five hundred on top of that the censor in these cameras affords a twelve stop exposure latitude with the use of cannon log
381.0,529.8, consistently and all three of these cameras it provides a wide is a range from three twenty of the twenty thousand in video camera terms that corresponds to gain settings of mine six deb to plus thirty debt now the base sensitivity of the censor is so six forty that equals master gain setting abeout to deliver the best dynamic range using cannon log can recommend the niceties ponds to again level sitting about two point five deepest effectively the full dynamic range when unannounced game including an option of wide dynamic range or canon law game to the versatility of these cannon log video game is an option for he recorded to mix files can log is also automatic when you're in the two caorches ting seaside frinstance all cinemas cameras offer view assist the sisters a function that provides a lot or look up table to the view finder or to the else d while you're shooting and lamos o that the image looks more or less normal to your eyes so that you can make exposure judgments all of these cameras provide standard definition as well they don't record standard diffidence all of them an output for instance from their stipend definition all of them cannot part from their day port but in addition if you need analogue composite standard definition of sea one hundred cannot from its about terminal these three hundred sea five hundred can output standard definition from their sank out terminal and the sea one hundred in addition can perform a really neat hat trick if you've recorded achnatra seine hundred and needest definition version you can put in estadismo of the camera and the camera internally will do a conversion from ashton the first card over to pagosa dard definition on the second card
529.8,607.98, i don't think i've ever seen that before and another camera the these three cameras also provide a full sweep of built in video scope very important i have argued for years that video cameras should contain wave for monitor displays these cameras do that their way four monitors include line blind and spot field or gib and also component whipper in addition they will display a victor scope display althotas not available in the sea one hundred but it is available very much so in the sea three hundred and see five hundred the lasso display an edge monitor displayed is used as an optional focus said and what i mean by that is you see along the bottom of the image a series of waves that when the image shadowed as well each of these cameras provides fifteen assignable buttons virtually every button on these cameras as assignable in addition to that because he's cameras
608.46,675.75, design from a common standpoint the buttons tend to be organized in the same way for instance along the lines here there is the same series of buttons magnification at top peking zebra and wave form so if he used a sea five hundred for instance shopkeeping up see one hundred and pretty much now where the buttons are these cameras also provide two channels of audio compressed or uncompressed the input audio input is flexible they each in the handles which madula and paced to the top of the camera the each provide to excel are in put in addition to which they provide a many one jack on the side for microphones that don't use clarinets and use the minion plug these cameras in addition provide pre recording it's a three second cash that looks video for three seconds until you press the record button at which point it captures the prior three seconds these three cameras also
675.9,685.14, adored to an entire universe of lenses cannon atlantis and that includes helen's
685.32,694.2, for the full format such as the cannon five de matto and mark three a full
694.2,808.32, the answer and the assize sense that for instance the cannon seventy contains these are super thirty five centers there about the same size as a p meaning that both if with the law with its larger coverage and e f s lances are appropriate to use for these cameras that creates over sixty access to over sixty lines now on the side of these cameras there are switches right near the lines that in each case activate and indite in the case of the sea three hundred sea five hundred there the undeserved by a small motor system on the sea one hundred its manual you can may be can heretick and what we have are clear to stops for stops and six stops which is pretty much covers the gamut that you need and these indies are remarkably free of air pollution at bright exposure levels that was demonstrated recently in new york and a comparison cameras were lined up and black was under high tantalizing different types of black materials were exposed and some cameras showed very bad air pollution and the requirements in antedate efficient as far as i are pollution these three cameras come with a three eight inch threaded hole for use with professional tripod adapter plates but cannon very thoughtfully for those of you who use quarterage quartered smaller tripods which are very popular these days cannon provides
808.35,839.46, after plate which is a quarter twenty adapter played in all you need is a screw driver to remove these forest screws and you can convert any of these cameras within a minute to a quarter twenty tripod plate you'll notice that there's a quarter twenty whole in the three eight inch tripod adapter already but that's more for use as a second attachment point when you're using the three tiered to attach to these cameras these cameras also
839.73,904.05, the three used commonly the same canon intelligent battery is a deep nine fifty five intelligent lothian i am battery there very popular there used in canon except canaries they have been around for a while and are easy to obtain malatesta about the cost effect of member of the cinemas family that would be the sea one hundred it's a smaller camera if you look at it compared to the sea three hundred seffeed about eighty five per cent the size it has a smaller view finder it has a slightly smaller elstree disesteem by the way is the only way you can get two times magnification which in this camera only appears here but doesn't appear here in the view finder this is the mount only there's no plot inside is a digression the two slots for the steadiness his camera records as i said holy it's
904.11,1091.64, and as such should only records by a by ethic is favored by broadcaster sometimes there's no by each now there's a removable handle that fetch dead includes the exhilarant two of them on one side over here and the controls over here to control this to the controls line up with the input and so that makes it fairly easy to know where you are you connected to the camera like that by adding a line we very quickly are building a camera that was designed for use by one person when you attach a hand grip you see you're in business a handgrip goes here actually you remove this cap first you're in business very quick very light very mobile in addition this camera has something that the sere hundred sea five hundred don't have it has a stereo mike built into the handle and i found many times that that useful when something you're building your camera something starts to happen really fast you don't have quite time to attach the external mike and this saves the day so this is i think a very useful feature i almost wish the other cameras had it but i'm glad this camera has it there's push out o iris very helpful push out o iris when you're using elancee the lens as can talk to the camera cannonades there's one shot autobus which again requires use of cannon of lances and one shot autous means that it's not continuous out of focus you press this button and the lens will focus once and grab what it thinks the focus is it doesn't change focus throughout the shot you released the button and start at that point now if you want continuous autous at any beecher a form firm where announcement was made there is going to be later the share a firm where upgrade that will allow the use of stanislaus with the same designation on them in atamans for stepper motor and those sons will have with this camera and auto continuous auto focus capability and that something that we look forward to that will be a lot of fun this land by the way that i got on here is an twenty four to one of series on it any bay it was cannon announced that this would do be the kit lansor this camera so this camera in this land compliment each other very nicely now let's talk about the sea three hundred the sea three hundred was the first sinai's camera it appeared in about late twenty eleven and it was introduced as botanica and a television camera and for that reason featured both in amount and appeal montpont being the mountaineers in feature making the
1092.0,1209.6, so inside of this camera is a cannon did the image process or that's the same one that the seas but this camera records not a bed but impact and it records the pig to to to see cards in the back of the camera it records nineteen twenty by ten eighty fourteen forty by ten eighty which broadcasters are fond of and twelve eighty by seven twenty again impedit includes all of the common frame rates including twenty three point nine eight and a true twenty four point oconto point zero zero for filming it outputs and uncompressed eight bit hath signal by hunter but his aitin it created from a much higher bit depth signal that is used in the internal processing of the cameras of very high quality sightseer from san hundred it was so popular with the same one hundred why not so this camera will have that too and also the firm were up dat will bring an additional format which is fourteen forty by ten dianthy five megabates persecution as well as inmates three hundred is and like to see three hundred it comes in both and if not an appeal mouthwash difference the mount
1209.72,1237.74, on both cameras is the same but the amount is different on the sea five hundred the tout comes with a mocking ring it looks exactly like this poulton its slightly smaller and it's an fount the reason that was done was because this is a true connemara and canon anticipated it would be used with cinemas zooms much larger sums i require a more robust
1237.77,1263.03, this camera records he internally just as this camera does and exactly the same formats they are all impact long got nineteen twenty by ten eight fourteen forty by ten eighty twelve eighty by seventeen twenty again the two cameras are identical in that regard where the cameras are different is in the ability of the sea five hundred to output
1263.06,1286.1, four and two for a row i should be specific for a raw for half raw two karg and to kiss and to output those signals via three to their due three gestures that are required to output the larger signals like force then implies
1286.1,1291.77, an external recorder and that would be a third party recorder canon doesn't make
1292.07,1316.31, the recorders necessary to record for and two argantes because there's no compression there's no image noise duke to compression when cannon log is used in general but specifically here were cannon louis automatic to raw output twelve stop exposure latitude is insured rigout
1316.7,1504.29, as a company by internal recording of the excess and exiles to see if cards what that means is that when you're out putting raw from this camera with her to care for kate you can simultaneously be recording on to compact flash cards the impact two files at you might record if you were shooting only a day so that means said whatever you have out put to a third party recorder you have a proxy a copy and identical copy on the cafard in a day in fact if you decide only to use he in the end well that might be your master file it's that good and quality now let's talk about canons one d the one decisions first force this in fact is the world's first forced this is mount only it is a desert is based on a one d x it has the same optical view finder in paterson of a oneidas all of the same still photography capabilities of a windy but with the addition of de recording and force recording it features a duel cannon deceive plus image processor domino of them because for a is a lot of data to push around on the inside of a small camera like this the censors and eighteen point one met magicians frame its basest is is four hundred the isis adjustable from one hundred to fifty one thousand two hundred with some extended settings there's a low extended setting of fifty is witherington of one hundred and two thousand four hundred or two hundred four thousand eight hundred those are so stratospheric it's hard to wrap my mind around what that means but this is a prowler is a result of that even at fifty one thousand two hundred is the images remarkably usable its noisy but the noise has been diminished in extraordinary camera for low light photography now in camera of force is twenty four and twenty five only twenty four and twenty five p it's recorded compressed its motion jective hundred megabytes per second and that's a blazing amount of data to record on to its caruthers pair of cards in here to record that these hundred i mentioned earlier out puts its force its force is raw and uncompressed but to record for internally it's necessary to record to a compressed form so again it's motionless
1504.89,1510.35, full frame censor on this camera can be used to capture and damage
1510.56,1514.49, but if your capturing a forte image
1514.82,1539.6, what this eighteen point one magical censor does is it windows down to an image that's forty four thousand ninety six pickels across which is somewhat smaller than the full sense and that's how forces recorded if you're shooting with a super thirty five lines which has a smaller image circle which is about the same size as well as a pis
1539.66,1550.31, fort used and still cameras if you're using either superior as type of lens then you're working at a much and even smaller
1550.31,1583.04, a circle or or image frame and the one decontaminate that as well it cannot put d at a super thirty five sized frame that it did it crops from its full frame size so each day can be out put one of two ways from the full frame of the full sense or from a crop superfine side portion of the censor meaning that you can use supercherie lenses and if selinunte cannon if mine
1583.04,1588.47, lenses used that are designed for a p cameras
1588.68,1589.79, the
1589.79,1614.3, super frame is the smallest the fore cave window or frames a little bit larger and then you have the full frame when its recording he records it twenty four p twenty five p thirty p fifty and sixty feet that makes it a world can like the other cinemas cameras the h d
1614.96,1620.45, is recorded to the cards as
1621.08,1764.72, eight it for too so again motion sped for four and hottest four eight bit for two o four h d as far as audio goes the one dese has a built in microphone which i find incredibly useful for running and gunning sometimes you want to capture something really quickly and you don't have time to build an audio rig on top you can just grab it fast it's also good for when you're doing double system sound it gives you a reference scratch track that you can use for lining up the higher quality audio recording later now there's atole control of audio there's user manually adjustable audio control there's also a headphone jack to monitor what you're recording now lastly the one dese has no fan so it's perfectly quiet audio recorder cirino when you're using this camera so let's recap the sea one hundred instruere optime for age decatur that's what they do the sea five hundred raises the bar on each equality because of its internal processing at the same time it enables two canorae with the help of a third party external recorder the one dies with its full frame censor is a kind of a swiss nife it's a remarkably version cannon support doesn't end after you purchase one of these cinemas cameras there's a website canon us where you can download manuals free software macapa firm where updates some of the firm were updates from any be that i've i've been mentioning for instance you can download a canon exult for importing accepts you can download lots to convert the canon law game to rex even in or senior why dynamic range you can download a canon except plug in for avitor for final capote if if you don't already have that there's also a cannon twenty four seven hot line eight five five sanies amazingly twenty four seven somebody will pick up the phone and answer your questions about hardware about software inquest you have work flowers
1764.72,1779.03, and we all know that we work through the night at times so in our next segment will focus on he captured recording using the sea one hundred and the sea three hundred in a little bit greater detail than we have stated
