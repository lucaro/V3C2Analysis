0.39,35.82, with dainty arapawa through the sweat is at low water slack the ready importing here timing the my time for when he intended ridges forming separate is lapwater and that is certain time on second thing is the depth of water and we have to make sure that we go between his rocky sections but also being at times when the death waters operator some tony do that certain to only canada
35.91,69.06, so to day were going to go through and the bridge and miss attracts just here my father another root and in between the together and the shore line and the following the looking back to check the leading lights to under this bridge of the unanswering to go between swells rock and the shore line and then art into simpletons time again missing recites the rock here by checking that we can still see that
69.18,131.4, and we are at what's called open on unesthetic theater soothes and three or four armed he coins places upon the peas we astrogate makes it quite a trick passage and and we do will do with the tide slightly against us so that we will have no taste opportunities to her eyes and sailing the idea is that we provide sailing tatepocoshe
133.77,201.93, sailing a sailing not requires coordination of all sorts of types of activities usually there are several people on the boat some one has esterel people have to pull ropes someone has to go in front of an orestes there are several types of activities and it's really important to coordinate the actions of every one to make sure that the boat sails to its best performance so in this way there is it such a combination of activities and skills required that these are like running a business where there is strategy there are people who need to manageress than people who need to plan ahead people who need to be working out what happens when things are quite going to plan so that we need mosetig si sailing is like a business with all the components of planning delivery reviewing and evaluating what need to happen so all of these together make them a boat work well and similarly they make a business actual
202.53,207.24, and the time what we got planned for this sir tramp what a voyage can
208.29,228.12, the outline sailing plan is to provide at work on a sailing trip which goes round angels in north wales not only does and will see provide beautiful coast line areas though lots of complications to do a title features and rocks and how crops and lighthouses and
228.42,252.54, for business purposes as well as for sailing purposes this requires quite a lot o planning what you need to do so we need to work out when to go what's going to happen with a wind how we going to get from eight to be and what termite to get there all these things together forbid a passage plant and this is ineffective overall strategy
252.9,255.39, poor the trip
255.93,263.88, not homesteads can people except alone with 
264.6,266.55, on a sailing yacht
266.67,315.96, a number things to work out it's important to be able to plan manage the boat properly and so to manage the sails we have to adjust the sails to suit the wind conditions that might mean sailing in particular direction to manage the wind or it might mean having to change the amount of sail reefing the sail if the wind picks up a wise a boat might be overwhelmed by too much wind it's always important to think about how the boat performs at its best the many other activities were about how to change direction in sailing so sailing into the wind across the wind and with the wind or require different sail or configurations
316.11,348.0, so that so sailing is sailing self setting the sails as really important spect another aspect that we were comfortress porto manage situations of safety these are critical about the if some one falls overboard it's really important certainly ran you can waters to get them out of the water as quickly as possible so i learn methods to pick up a person potentially a person whose follered
348.18,351.48, and that's called man overboard recovery drill
354.24,384.57, activity that we were on its moorings that is about how to come up to a mooring boy he often asettin affections or a long coastlines and in attracted areas and the idea is that you can use sail in towards a moreing in order to be able to stay there or rest the staveleys and this forsooth to needing to anchor
384.81,398.52, the import thing about starting to mourning is healing work out what the tide is going on what the wind is doing both really affect thee the way to the boat goes and a very slow speed through the water
398.55,406.56, so he ought to make a judgement about which way is the wind langwitch ways a tion and tied his king
407.01,412.5, on a different tack tell me about the beauty of siding was the attraction of sailing in nothing
412.95,432.96, sailing a boat requires such a wide range of skills techniques and abilities experience it's about operating quite a complex machine in a natural environment which is constantly changing that the waves the wind the tide
433.14,435.36, changing
435.51,479.55, vessels that are in the area she affect what you going to do so it's really important to pay attention to the said the whole of the idea of running a boat now what really makes me interested in this that not just about running the boat itself there's lot of physical activity a lot of moving about it's you out in the open air you have good views of the area or around a really also what works is when there are several people together and you making the boat work and there's a way of working together every one these tecolote to keep boat working right and then in addition to that some one else has to do the looking after
479.85,495.21, the drinks preparing the meals making is all prepared to be able to continue to do the activity catherine just here about your experience your or considerate actinia psychologist how does this help you in your well
496.98,565.92, background as a clinical psychologists has provided me with a lot of ways of working with people who have so many unique ways in which they act and learn about the world themselves every one brings their own contribution not to just to a boat but to each other in the world as far as sailing is concerned in the teaching of techniques on the boat are particularly patteson to whether people like to learn the santanu by doing them just getting on and doing it and seeing what happens whether they prefer to be helped through the great down what the task is and talk through it first at tartarin the mind and then they can pull it through or thirdly a different approach is when people like to be shown what to do said the eye provide them with a guide and on an undetailed of the steps of the way so there's a three man methods of helping people learn the technique of sailing
567.39,576.42, the other additional parts to the technique is the importance of communication with each other on the boat
576.6,616.32, how people need to use short phrases when you got wind taken to account and also to trust each other on the boat recently i had in experience of her husband and wife of the husband as usual as often is the case was doing a most of the instruction to do with many in all he was dan mostly guidance on the only navigation and i was suggesting to the wife that she learn a bit more about at an aviate so that in unfamiliar areas he could begin to trust her to give her
616.32,620.91, her to give him the right kind of information on which
621.06,634.86, to the best attraction is going to be sailing in so this was really a man potapitch the couple had communicated differently with each other on this particular aspect of sailing
635.55,646.5, the couple in particular i we were able to work out that there wife particularly was keen on breaking the task down thinking through it working it all out
647.34,686.88, doing it practising it and then rehearsing again going through it in her mind as to what the different steps were in fact it worked out of real imbricated aeromotor board and she was able to really accurately rehearse and tell me back what the steps were her husband in as a different method was prepared to to do the activity and then to see how it worked and he was all different aspects of how the boat functions different sails different aspects of the engine all sorts of different features of the boat in order to reach the same objective
687.39,699.12, and finally just tell me about you yoost testator just described and tell me why she such a good lot to learning what makes her special
699.57,731.58, seistan light thirty nine and though she's quite an old boat by one bookstands twenty years old she is very stable in a kind of wave and wind conditions when a lot of boats might not consider going sailing and as result works very well and keeping a bucket as a very comfortable ride for people who are less certain less familiar with sailing on repeaters
731.79,780.9, the boat itself was also gone to his well insulated so that when you inside the boat you often just don't hear the waves and the wind when you outside and so it's all very comfortable indeed with got on board with also got leave to let every one with we have courage really good navigation systems communication systems without word with the cardinals we've got satellite devices we pottage of safety devices that make sure that everyone is safe and coal in the boat as well as should the worst happen that we are well prepared for surviving managing even should we need to be got into the water
781.32,787.83, captain just tell me about communication and conversations and how they help the learning process on testers
790.68,806.64, when sitting about there all real phases of activity every one joins together its puteal up to get the boat going to carry out menoetes to really getting the boat working properly
806.76,811.53, and then what seems to happen is that
811.62,818.19, relaxing from this normal cruising mood there's a relaxing from
818.34,822.84, the activity that has happened and in these pauses
822.93,878.46, full of effort there are also times reflection often find that there are lots of conversation as a curvette numbers the crew and this reticular time i have been able to incorporate into mine a way of providing the sailing experiences by allowing for time for conversation acknowledging that people have faces activity and these pauses for reflection and in these pauses reflection is possible to talk about all sorts of matters that could be personal they could be that which are just normal conversation that people have about family and friends and every day life however what i've also done is how to build such position and focus among for example business issues so i prompt people into having conversations about how the business is doing
878.58,917.91, include sometimes on the crew a coach a business coach who can work with our colleagues coaching colleagues who were also on the boat and they can have extensive conversations about from a business issues and in this way it's possible to have conversations of boat work while not at work but yet completely separate from and away from work and this provide real portunity for reflecting not just on how you are working and working through business issues but it's all so chanced to do that for a short period of time
917.97,924.45, what she most men allocation sailing and because learning point have you had
926.37,938.79, the most careful moments for sailing was on finishing the three peaks or race this was in june twenty twelve
939.06,961.44, when i was sailing with a tipping the boat with my son and a friend of his and there were three people who sainte boat we horsehairs and the idea is that the sails start the boat sailed and the boat from midway upon fort william in scotland and the runners
961.59,1007.94, up the mountains of snowdon scafell and ben nevis and the holy ventilates our race the mad triumph about this event was being able to owe the take about ten yards while we talk and narrow channel that we judged we had the right kind of current fall and we dismantle very well and a spinister hours and with my son also navigating as an expert tormentin osman he could navigate very carefully the current washed and see spots happening on the water so was using his incredible technical skills for seeing the water and
1007.97,1017.81, planning what to do in the tactics of how tom or unwin to gittin so when we arrived at fort william it was just a really credible
1017.96,1098.21, i feet and effort and pleasure to enable to sailormen oeernitatis aeternitatis
1098.96,1141.44, the notoriousness
