9.99,22.62, making the the film the assault on all capitan it's kind of just exploded a little bit as far as where it's gone it's always been a really
23.94,31.5, a big idea of mine to get to the bottom of the wings of still the bale on i've always
31.89,38.34, i always heard from various people that you know that route this that routes that
39.78,44.7, i've just got to a point where i'm like well i just need to climb it and make up my own decision
46.95,65.43, i approached my body jeff argand was like a afterwards in my dthis is going to make a pretty interesting film i know you're in the film industry and what you think about this is is like a really novara story and safest
65.76,71.64, that up and ran with it and had just amazing how
71.91,74.46, exploded 
74.97,78.21, i didn't see that combination is going to be
78.9,90.63, big as it is yet it's a little weird being the center of attention and the subject of the film that is you know it's really just kind of a story
91.08,95.04, what happened and i think that's kind of the coolest
96.0,99.39, aspect of the film in my opinion is of
99.6,104.94, answer a lot of questions of what did happen back then and
105.42,108.24, people felt the way they did and
108.39,117.72, it answers a lot of questions but then a brings up a lot of questions at the same time going and do and the question and answer
118.44,128.07, what is one of the premier and his kind of getting up on stage and answering questions trying to let people know
128.55,131.31, you know what i found up there and
133.44,138.21, that was kind of the key for me to unlock the
138.69,147.33, the secret of what they really did up there because you know people believe them one hand this and one hand that
147.42,152.7, nobody really knew until i went up there and saw exactly what it was and
153.09,155.82, in the amazing
155.88,160.2, one of a lot of different things of
161.58,162.57, now
162.81,167.43, but what they did and actually learning some of the stuff
167.97,170.67, in the past with they went through
171.96,192.3, so yeah we're all still taller
