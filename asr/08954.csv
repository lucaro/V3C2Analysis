11.82,256.05, in publishing house the not old better show i think we've got a real tree prior to day you're going to hear from her and just the second the herb is hater had a green is a free lance journalist she has written for years for business week and she's just written a wonderful new book to catch a cat how three stray kittens rescued me it is fantastic it is not what you think it is a book about life redemption love and just a story like no other i had a chance to talk to heather in our studio you're going to have a chance to see other i was joined by my wife gretchen vogel's an who's a well known potater we had a great interview please watch the special interview with heather following this and then listened to the audio interview with heather thanks enjoy it my name is hateeta book called the catcat it's a memoir about how a rescuing three kittens in the backyard of my boyfriend then boyfriends bensingers tanto my life and i think i think what the book is about it something that resonant with a lot of people you know i love cats i love animals but the book was more about how this project of rescue a cat to just made me forced me to change my perspective in life and i think we all get into these time periods are rude routines were we just need something that'll shift us to think about things differently uttereth differently and and that's what these kittens did for me and you know having to catch them and figure out how to tame them and take care of him and find homes for them and so you know you'll look at the book in all its sorrows its got this kitten on the front of it but it's really a broader story about finding connection and i found connection through these cats to this community that i didn't really know before because i had been living in manhattan so to take care of the kittens i had to come and stay with my hat my boyfriend and union city and so i was forced to connect the community on the block and then little by little i realized that i need we need a lot of help and so i was forced to connect with this whole group of cat rescuers that little by little i got to know and who i you know sort of joke or there my bowlines know we spent a lot of time together we talked about our jaws we talk about our families we talk about you know all these kittens we have suddenly found and just really rooted to his place and then the kitten restrict also forced me to connect to another person which was my husband and so really it came down to how an unexpected finding you know he reinhard made me reconsider a lot of things in life and made me feel like i finally had a connection where before i really hadn't felt like antisthenes were number three to spot in zero and they were all named their own beautifully cut little white kitten with spots on them and so they were named for their spots are insurable spots and so and so they all had these fine little personalities and number three was really brave to spot was very severe and very sweet and zero wanted nothing to do with us but little by little had got to know is my favorite cat however was toinette mother and i never expected that we would bring her in she was a fair captive outside but one day i just couldn't stand the cold winters in the north east any more and not being able to find her and so i let her into a rougher the triceratops and so now she is my cat and she means the world to me i love her so much and i think that that something that all of us can relate to his how you have this other being in your life who needs you you know responded you so much and who was always there for you and that's how he is to man she jumps up she still siberia but at the end of the day when i get on get into bed she'll really jump up and come in line come and you know want to be petted and that is just the word to me
