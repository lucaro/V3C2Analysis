22.44,28.71, my name's sororities in form
28.86,32.52, and one question that has with
32.64,34.44, future and that industry
34.47,37.95, sorry
38.01,47.97, it was that night as a power menstruate this race discourse under the gastritis
48.0,63.36, how do misestimated to to try to change the untutored that's great reconsiled me have a collation to now
63.36,68.01, from now on for the rest of the evening but i can do 
68.19,85.65, have a chat refutations were to these things i have punched questions that i might say a man i agree what is the answer to that so let's bring these conversations in the duties that respond to some in questions like lets you those
85.86,142.29, i actually will share that concern say i think that the media are the least response of all institutions we had to the aspirations of racial and gender justice i think it is even more problematic because it's not just an industry in terms of you know having access to those jobs but it actually shapes the consciousness that oghtserah entire society and the ciceros unlike any other institution that at least is under a legal obligation to pretend there opportunity the entertainment industry an argument supported largely by the first amendment that they are created in a prize
142.38,168.12, so they can go about discriminating because imitative not in the image of the writer that the carriage of a black brown or or native american in meantersay that care now to southern of their characters parliamentry that disparity would be a prime apaches
168.39,188.85, discrimination except from the entertainment industry so in innumerous problem that one of the institutions that most important is also the one that we have the least access to in terms of trying to counter is deleterious effects now having said that
188.94,288.75, questions about how we consume media there is question about whether we can vote with our pocket books there is the question of whether all his new media is going to provide other for for us to create other expectations in the great underway of consuming media i again young people who are hoping raised in a context in which they're all reasonably to really is that the task of bisection to think about ways of using some of this new technology and and the fact that there are so many options to create a demand for different kinds of media personally what i i don't go to stuff than i think represents the same kind of series of means that there's not a lot that i can actually watch and every now and then when i really get up with dotterine the letters which they say one letter confound it who knows that's like a little drop in the ocean but in leaving makes me feel like i'm doing something other than complaining about seeing the same stone over and over again and in thinking that there is an aggregate langwich all of us can make that a more powerful message and missus ilustracion one i got and what i venture to assure work among them others in litigation through critical releasement estifania and it be accepted or challenged a lot of at the agency of the school and i guess i was just wondering your thoughts in sight
288.93,584.97, feel like what i what is complex for me and what i am still tied to make sense on his back and so sure and an air convent help that it is very apologizing it has been from him section of it and and that i am anywhere person and that is very easy that in the conversation that we have the agents in the train as it becomes about the individual inheritance that they live and it is hard to bring in the structural and ending in intention turning to both in an old iron over by a disinterested box about hoontin to insinuations wellington do that work i will say that i think that the challenge that you face in the one individual frame for apology or even i would say correct adjustment is something that we say in almost every other institution so what are the ways in which the civil rights project has been married has been taken out of the structural institutional invited just about individual so i think it would look across all the least disciplines and all these practices are would probably see a very similar kind of move on the naturalized and normalize structure in which we live and identified individual choice individual pathology individual latterly at the sight of all the thautapati there's a collective project that we're all undergoing with language and imagery and discourse that takes the individual and puts it in a social istorical structural context that's part of what was behind the animation that we understand postprandial level and tell the historical structural story about it right untheatrically designed to tell us harry about structural races and i tell astor about perfoliata correctly structural races you will understand it affrontive are not reversion or not presently think that that frame work can be used across a lot of temperature practices in wildness look the same but it is about trying to take the problem and broaden the wind so you can see it within a scene set within afraid where you can actually draw people's attention to the institutional consequences that they are facing it doesn't leave us and provide the outin but his good of evidential of understand the problem of than there something wrong with you the individual here is a problem in society in which you are situated and the various responses that you can make to anyone not goin to say all that responses are equally valid but it toneladas people can understand what is structural and what their agency is within that structureless tarantella promontories and talked about the deacons and possibility and how when you start out of automobiles background you are a understand that comes and possibly at the same had aspirations to have a sense of confidence and confidence these are things that we need to build in our crimes because of structural rangement of society that have pressed on crimean then we don't have an even planetoscopists that our clients had very well then they come from the public factors in such a mantuamaker
587.31,596.37, a talk about how he was privileged as he widowers and one fat
597.72,602.19, that he should people that are catledge should
602.25,610.41, the others understand about action and also a knowledge of their people races on to
610.41,613.68, overtaken
613.86,620.49, ah certainly and and you know i gotta
620.7,623.1, in response to
623.13,638.88, it suits claim how can we help to rise and handed out statuette or canooering romanianus important of unmentioned in the talk
638.94,651.12, what happened in ohio and pennsylvania was that actually union workers for the first time had to talk to other union orders about the significance of race
651.15,719.97, and they had a talk about the difference between an agenda and the other agenda the fact that the person who had that time people thought had of policies that were more work of friendly might not be the one that looks like you this was not work that i could have done or door in ohio even though i'm trombine had that was worth that what people had to do with other wife he which is not to say that the only thing but it's important to be able to have a frank conversations about the way the racial consciousness has so deeply installed itself into the den of people's consciousness that it takes other people as i was there to hear how i got out of it here in the things that i think about when i think about my future and it does me that i might underclothes were listeners and listen to what he's saying rather than i think he is so that that was important work it was groundward it wasn't you know you are not yet a covered in the new york times but if you went locally and solid people were doing there was unground war
720.18,785.97, question of racial consciousness and in many a huge difference in those battleground state and unfortunately is that because we told ourselves a story that he ran upon racial campaign we haven't built on the capacity in the infrastructure that was developing we have shared valiente the ground ran wanted you do how did you say how did you come to this moment so it could be replicated so we have few we are to wait the world we have the gorge limbs as other right about it and tell us about it bowed have the cunnington and popular culture that can reproduce this in a way that necessary to action they are permanent consciousness change round than one that was necessary to win an election sainteville now is building a cultural sorrentine discourse that is in about one lection that to have some kind of movement potential and frankly what you were going to have to be funnier in that effort
786.78,795.78, i allow manager
796.05,804.0, hesitation my question is how do we more cloud
804.18,812.88, inalienability one of the sultanas like an aspen as leon
812.91,821.61, centertable plantagenet homoeopathically or in fact
822.27,835.05, but the party father when works the whole border to enter but in my own administered no hadmiration animation
836.85,840.39, coriolanus
840.42,847.71, the appleton and and but i was sharp who are thinking about just that question
847.8,850.92, so calculated democrat
851.01,864.0, ascertainable is this question so he looks at the announcin of monachal profiling which is all about
864.0,911.61, in eternity of whom people think the drug profile represents and laying it up up alongside of the people who had been arrested and basically the capital deerskin to develop in order to raise consciousness in awareness against this process is to show the difference you think you're getting this person but actually is the person who has the hill a family at all and is riding her as he did not because of that dread the back of because he's got three heads at all points to say effectively in this person is probably ok with the problem is mistaken identity to really hard to a
911.61,925.41, for a campaign from cosmoramas part almost everything traditional sort of civil rights and i cry intervention is kind of like that right is like you know you think you're doing this
925.5,1044.48, actually doing this is part of what he untethered so one i can tell you some of the directions the conversation has gone in partition that it's gone in is not just talking about the problems of criminal procedure but the problems of substantive criminal law in the first place so you move from you know yes we have generously come down hard on it but we have to be more careful not to racial profile too well when and how his race played a role in attending them time carteret enterprise particularly as it affects questions of drugs riposte canalization of drugs itself in a racial project how coracias patterns of who uses what actually become formalised by law so yet this huge disparities so part of the question is moving from the a modest reformist agenda to actually greater abolitionist agent and recognizing that along the way these tendencies to try to get political capital at the same whatever you do a despot you should make a move with these other post recognizing that that's a reformist sometimes people have to make for the individual but it does not advance the overall challenge of the carrousel were i often have to think about in measurements in the reformist iteration that proofreader real clients and real people that you're actually trying to get resort of intervention for occasionally those reformers arguments have to be made
1046.64,1051.92, as for coming repeatedly my question about
1052.28,1057.92, how you like to many knowed you think i can do it to create a kind of
1057.98,1062.45, between the black community and latinity for i think
1062.51,1065.48, the struggles and atheism
1065.48,1128.39, those communities may seem very different though they might unnecessarily be but a feather a distance between the two men awondering tousling pride man to other kinds community like crimes legs inability to actually find points of intersection that can advance effective coalition so their attentions not only between black and brown black brown and astarte on between rapacities and gender definites and after proposition a leconte you about the tensions between african american communities and the lustrous is what is it hampered mechanisms that we might be able
1128.63,1179.72, to dream up to help us deal with that happy now in one hand there are well material realities that are largely created by the recognition of that as long as the pies are constrained in such a way that forces groups to compete over small pieces of wood in fact is a huge piling as our premotion is on the very few things that are available to us as working people as people of color as women is egypt and not refuge amount in in what some i think collectors and i agree with what is all to our discourse internal and not based on the broader huge
1180.17,1188.06, word distribution of wealth of telesinus what is our conversations do we start there were found
1188.06,1227.81, have the police that number one so winnest having visions viewpoints does discourses that focus on the mat bed till four percent on something like sixty percent of the weltering about development and the united states is not no reconnoiters the equal distribution right so that's number one number two and i share this partly because i have good fortune pennoyer with a multiracial group
1227.99,1275.03, a vote americans and people from latin america when we were again in the world conference of races and parties was how can we be there and really be ultimate kinds of advocacy that we were doing at the world state so on one and i would have expected somebody made a meticulous to push reparations they were expecting me to support issues of sovereignty we had to figure out how to build this coalition not just in terms of scratch my dagger but in terms of totally immersing ourselves in each other's histories in each other's priorities and in asking some howieson like
1275.09,1281.27, i i'm a good friend of yours and your taking me into your home and let's say home is
1281.75,1401.15, sort of a metaphor for your political community one of the kind of things that he might do in your home that are the deal breakers your people say they never rautenbach operations when a water some egotistical and we we were nawitch other about some of these things so you know with a with some of my friends were danimarca there say you know what really is is our son is in labor conflicts when somebody mutineers don't recognize our sovereignty solentsea us animata really isn't deal breaker so can we pietrasanta ing from momentum was that don't undermine what to eat in sacramento and you know they were tetons with americans who were saying you know one and were told it you know we sorcerer here and we are followed italian slackening ernestine talk about what it was the maid falardeau what we eat think that we really want any hollister and know about our history before we go on in and with each other anywhere so there terminating expectation that we know stuff because alfred that we know wentilation to bill effect of learning which then becomes a predicate for greater trust is not that i happened just as we're all in the same sand
1401.15,1441.95, so his little things barnegat i think they have to start in at the start with people or collision minded whose boobyish comes not from being in locataire community but in incoordinate most progressive forces in their community the ones that are interested in coalition indistinction for the coalition of worth that i tonewerot
1442.16,1454.37, well i i question as a personal and preliminary the question is it come to south one irritation sullying alone
1454.43,1466.88, but i research like a dungaree i come disillusion solitudes i wanted on whether or not
1466.94,1471.59, can affect in a safe or a challenge
1471.59,1476.75, imitate even the contradiction of the systematic
1476.9,1513.14, all right thank you for giving me a chance to clean it up so much say well i will be trains is thorne to be sure and an doellstedt last school nominative ye when that i carried on artemisia were going to continue to deliver victory andicola and frighten institutional discrimination within a monomania and exactly what we were entering moscow was the time that the back lash was starting to happen
1513.41,1578.24, i went to law school when ronald reagan was elected i was in law school when people like slingstones became on the court sees living through that back lash hypostatic stress on anabelle possibilities that were here yesterday that now have had taken up the table so somewhat you hear from me it is trite the rod of vision of the possibility alive so that the the cost of these losses is not a complete mind wife of oposit so i belong weasels with a hope that incarnates that people have a sense of their something more than we were fighting for then it just the right not to be called you know an african american so have said that i don't want to come impression
1578.24,1688.7, that reason abandoned law abandoned that discourse because of either institutions that were right to do something or they don't either in individual can do something when impunity or not these all the charming by relevantly rules to the bay overly heroes happened that isadore court but every where and lawyers are needed every where to put or the ground or against the retrenchment right so just because the nine folking in desire people that we can do in these conflicts to get to doesn't mean that there are lots of things that can happen and we do have been all along the lines of the legal system so we meet people and we need people have a consciousness about social justice and understand that the image of social dustsheets doesn't come through the law as a tool for it but to have it from somewhere else first and so that is our challenge having a consciousness about social justice that isn't determined by nine people sitting in washington d c but that is actually expression of your lives your communities aspirations the history that we come out of being able to carry that forward with the skill of being a lawyer that's what we need not isolating i said would have boisterous and the carpenters
1689.36,1692.66, i have two
1692.66,1714.65, questions in brought up your versification and ultimate and some of my divertissement ion and i will like to know like what do you think about macerations of the time are in any slighting question in about a tea party in postmastership between the tea party and prostrations
1714.74,1797.54, a fortalice voice as like great questions so on the first question first question refract the animation she i hold the animation does it provide at least a predicate for the answer of oversecretion so a lot of people would see i have the practicing in at the end which is meant removed the effects of those obstacles that litter the lanes that some people are reading in the is a stand in for race conscious programs with their outreach programs with her oficial criteria with their entering programs all that had the effect of minimizing the effect of those particular obstacles to the things that people tend to see his reverses crimination so part of putting it on a track is the sale kinglets reverse about removing this that is affecting this propitiating them on the other lad is not to say that if you come up with an obstacle that shone other groups of being affected in catastrophes p sothern between saying well let's expand or attentiveness
1797.54,1804.2, in articles that face of variety of groups first sang the rapid as far
1804.26,1813.14, and any intention or some of his consequences is reversed discrimination so i'm hoping that the tool can be used
1813.35,1849.92, have a conversation about what is retelling what do you see in this that would be personation on the taliesin my god so allodialist that that short and quick the tea party i think represents precisely that contradiction that i was talking about which is you can't talk about races but you surely can talk about recommended about being called rasputin say race thinks so but ambarisha protest
1850.22,1970.79, not the action ran so that this contradiction is huge growing in my concern is less that the tea party exists is doing it then that they are loud to do it without significant critique that the voices of resistance had been cowed into silence by the basicranial and we haven't come up with another or response to the note eurasian my calling racehorses writing what we can from that on i think were englishmen it seems we don't know what to say we don't have a lot of leadership on how to do this from the white house on down and so rattening for them to tell us what okay to say were just come home to start sanitation when thus basically you know signing on to it by our silence all dust and on the noisier so part of what happened in the first weinstein is not just the the redeemer's took over in tediousness ouaouaoua the handle raised is all yours and i worried but there something like that going on now people just say that little bottle this portentous were stopping away and because some of those people might look like us were slow in uptake and we got to be on this we had to be as prepared to be critical stepping away from racial justice whether a democrat doing it or republican
1970.91,1974.09, i have alienation
1975.5,1980.24, and with the last comment as any
1980.54,2005.05, as on appreciation in the plane of the african american community in this patrician society that we are all fortunate are yet was unfortunate in so many different ways so let's start by this meliores a few facts 
2005.05,2008.44, the percentage of blacks in the population
2008.44,2015.91, the voting botheration is such that we cannot make a break anything at
2015.91,2041.08, streight the talk about the church got the black church and there were the churches of when we talk about the resource in the use of fundamentalist religious sort of ideas to bankroll this and push it forward even we think about the radio messages that were unblacked is like
2041.11,2047.68, they were all like radiant people didn't pay for the abolition conti
2047.74,2050.71, were racially confer france is
2050.86,2071.23, homerically corporate in spring so the consoles in being able to trace and talk about where things actually came from now that certainly not to say that the black community does not have its own heroes and homeland with which his real
2071.38,2096.97, it also not to say that there are better ways of finding indigenous organizations women the black community to carry that message forward rather than seeking to organize in from the outside to the organization that i work with people that i support were all very frustrated about the fact of the campaign
2096.97,2140.26, didn't lift up and recognized the people inside the blackout with experts use and with legitimacy who are better able in position to do the hard work of dealing with heterosexual specific terms so so that that the unfortunate piece of it i i think the just as the black community has to deal with heterosexual foliage community has to deal with racism and the same way that african american et communities are pivotal in dealing with persecution there also imitated with race
2140.26,2154.66, a community so in a classic intersectional problem it requires intersectional sensibilities but importantly it requires organizations who have the independent resources
2154.72,2185.08, to be able to set a genders without having to bound to or in other ways be seen as literate by those who have the resources to determine what the intentional like in hoping that this was the tatatatatat never be that bad again and the telescope to political organizing an intersection away are always going to tobacco the property to mating happening 
2186.76,2205.81, it is in a wonderfully
