0.96,17.55, and
17.97,20.1, steering
20.16,25.98, canonisation where every one's fascination with like the past
26.34,29.4, you know i think bios like the parent vehicle
29.85,34.47, or mulotter sister indulge in like modern music
34.65,37.56, i have i have like
37.65,137.04, historic field to it you know as most people know it was pretty much the only medium of buying music back in sanderson's and and then i kind of died out as castanares came around but honestly it was right around the time the pod came out that other people started you know looking for other astonishing estate in tears after the pod came out music we started to become almost independent really became like the river sonnontoueronnons
137.04,138.39, i think that
138.45,148.08, i was just one more for their costs and when you get a vital you get the record and now you can actually get an download code
148.17,160.32, every single new mine it comes out so i think that the record was in the artist's everyone collectively dinner really good job at marketing if you're listening winston
160.86,204.36, the qualities that sound so with vinelike a warmer tone to it it's like a a more more consistent cleaner sound as opposed to digital everything sounds you know we don't we wouldn't really catch a cause everything we listened to his digital but if you do go back and listen to a bunch of line alliterate sound so there is the aspect of a higher quality sound in a way because it isn't everything does this sound so polished and sharp and clean like idigi because final aconites more of a natural feel so they feel like they appreciating the art the warm clear crisp sound that you get out of inalienable anything that you'll get out of anything that title
204.42,217.14, the music is just going to tamper with less you know so there's no compression there's no a thing like that and i feel that it's kind of
217.2,249.72, very appealing about it is that now and with the newer generation it's a little bit more it's more commercial you know for young people i think a lot of it is just you know the nostalgic and historic aspect of it you know it's something that was popular and you know just like you know people who do know spend the money on film camera
249.81,256.02, you know of the past and that was you know so popular before them you know may be from their parents generation
256.02,291.0, the law original music you know the guides that inspired the young people now the jimmy handed the bob marable going back to the old original music yonder where i came from akoukou tracks and hereditaments where the paper went history i think
291.12,370.62, something different i mean by a brings a different element to consumption than do you know download or streaming services and events which was like you know next big thing at a previous time but decline of compact is of actual sin is a hundred per cent because you know what people are just buying less music in general because you can find it on you to be and just want to look into boruca get pandora you can get potatoes comfortable on the level you know of the man or the artist career i feel that you know if you're an upcoming artist instead of being worried about what they're taking for you you know you should try to get your stuff on their kind of for exposure morehouse
370.86,374.04, so forth a final sales are obviously going to help
374.19,375.45, stores
377.04,379.41, and but you know it's also
379.92,532.35, going back to these traditional forms of listening to music i think his overall just helping every one in the industry i wouldn't necessarily say that it would uninventive think that it brought something meditate for the younger generation and it's also i think very pleasant for the older generation that had they used to collect finally now that saw all these modern upended records towards glibness now seeing them come back i'm sure is susan amazing experience in itself so i think that final would say you know the music industry for say i think it's done wonders for it and i think that it's just going to we're just going to keep getting more and more creative restored out of the year usually know independence stores in their culture and what happens is you know you got your own party in your celebration with botanical artists or what lowtherslacks threatened but as far as physical means are concerned i think firecracker to stay going
532.56,544.77, something to hold it something to remember most of the young people that i see coming in they talking about music that i knew and i was a kid i'm shocked that they even now some of the artist
544.8,619.2, they probably heard her parents talk about it or they see it a moving with an ottomanisation james brown movie that is without and the four seasons i think that inspired a lot of people to come back to someone older music and i have fusileer fourteen fifty as allatoona what they asked for when they ask for like my job plan or rochester plane or groups like that from the fifties sixties seventies it's kind of amazing when you hear you know what they like people are always appreciate it just because it is a secret a form like an old cigarette hoellenrachen
619.41,638.34, we were going to keep collecting them and he were going to cane wanting to find barminster album said you know signatures on the cover and everything like that collections are going to keep your annaple in just going to suddenly lose interest and then oh as they do have a good you know to have that value to that
638.34,667.32, yes an extent it'll keep going i'd like to see how you know how big his whole final collecting thinkest it's i think it's going to love of of entry i don't know when a lethargic but i think it'll keep going from first hand experience that it's only got in bigger and bigger an you know with with artists like you mentioned my child to him now and specially like jack
667.32,736.62, being creative you know like with that last you know release a jack i did with the holograph on the finland ilang backwards you know i think it's important for aristotle could offer into it it's going to be a good sustaining it's not altogether
739.23,744.63, on there to this 
745.08,752.04, he is the way i used to defeat that was meant to be mine of
753.21,756.84, the sides also timeless
757.83,772.32, i feel that mine will always be titles or i would just say intimate i think that's like the best word and sort of the scythe entire passes that you get when you indulge in a record that pass on while
772.44,776.46, just so many paces to it
776.52,781.65, the size of it i think is getting to the actual line
782.34,794.52, take the string abano taking the sleeve out of the jacket setting everything aside got to be careful with it treelike woman right
794.94,800.76, then set in the record down delicately on to your limacina
800.88,807.33, this intimate to such intimate thing so yet i think that's just how i do it
810.18,823.56, anything about that deafened
