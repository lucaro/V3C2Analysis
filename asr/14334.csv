0.03,20.73, the the thing about the subway there's this wonderful anonymity about it and i say like the vast majority of the people that go by don't really notice at all you know that you are there i definitely observed what's going on around me
20.79,28.11, if you're playing a platform most of the people that you see are going to be standing there for a last minute so they are like a part of your world
28.14,45.51, wild sometimes interesting things happen somebody would be there and they'll run into somebody they haven't seen in a long time or like two people that you didn't think we're together always had a contention like i mean your observing all these strangers in your sort of watching them for some duration of time so like funny stuff happens
50.55,152.82, i shall end i put like either at least some change but you know a couple of dollar bills in the hat that's got to be money in a half from it beginning and i don't feel shy about it the gratulation montrealer worahaimanoo there really to like solicit people's money like a bally onto the subway and my mislike to play what i feel like playing if i place up that i love and like an i'm really enjoying what i'm playing the like at least certain people will pick up on that and i'm not a extorted type so i'm not going to like him adorned play like what everybody wants to hear is that just not who i am if i disconcertment enough people will respond to that that i make like mine and that's cool for me now
156.99,236.04, i consider myself to be more introverted than an average person i can sort of create my own little space in the subway and like people can enter it if they want to but i don't feel like so much like i'm imposing it enough it's in a way it is a less assertive were performing an there's something that i liked about that foretopsail when there's nobody in the resentment and like it dead as like singing in straight into a carpet like it it's crazy hawkstone 
236.1,388.86, i sort of put more focus on my plain what i feel like planning and that is a bit of a field you know that sort of protects me from because like if i can play what i feel like playing and like what i love to play then it doesn't really matter what how people respond you can imagine like ferrying it up you know and trying to anderton audience and they don't give you any money how empty that you're going to feel when that happens you know whereas like if you're just playing stuff that you love and nobody likes his synthesis the sadducees and some it beautiful and sodawater belike i don't know like i have as much right to do what mealtimes anybody else that you know so i think about that probably about twenty five percent of what i play is like original stuff another twenty five per cent is like coverthorne wooing traditions right and left so like if there is a beautiful thing that has really deep roots and like an islet and like all the better i know people are like the like the antithesis
389.07,452.79, vast vast majority of people are never going to know or appreciate the music that i make and that's totally fine with me the point is i try and play some music is true to who i am and i think that some small number some small percentage of people will react to it and that's all eagerness
