702.39,703.59, things that i
703.59,706.68, until now is that
707.37,711.12, much my mom was really there for me
712.53,715.86, she was there throughout the entire sinless men
715.86,717.36, i realize it
717.39,718.59, she was
718.59,721.17, one who is truly there
722.79,723.99, stop
727.05,735.36, all the same that i did to her most hopeful thing remorse
735.36,737.19, only support
737.76,739.59, the land
740.31,742.77, on the right by the case
744.63,748.23, my family healthy man accosting
749.13,751.35, having all the people
752.67,764.76, having people say oh you're so stupid for wanting to do that and people cry understand why i was hurting so bad to want to take my own life or thy understand why i was feeling that way
764.79,769.47, having almost positive people around the exceptionable out of that
769.53,770.76, passion
771.06,776.4, which people often and his people after on the fracas for help
776.79,780.0, i think i just kind of learned different ways to
780.15,784.98, embrace and cope with it if i'm able to just come out and say he
785.16,786.42, but it is
787.11,789.54, i don't think men differently
789.87,793.38, and then just kind of use my data day life to prove to them that i am
793.56,795.6, different from the except
795.81,797.22, be
797.82,799.92, i don't understand
800.55,804.24, ellis turned repoint 
804.6,808.14, back of the curtain or to
808.38,811.56, to that person struggling with that sort of
811.86,813.3, she whether
815.76,820.62, schofield educate it more about men or help
820.92,826.44, i mean the only way that i would have known about this i mean is my family
826.65,831.09, and our count lawyer slashed doctor telling us these things but
831.9,836.82, it was for him i would have no idea of what was happening
838.38,843.45, i think that it's important for people my age to talk about metals because
843.6,851.1, a lot of teams out there who were older than me and one to me that don understand what's happening with them
851.1,853.11, in that they're going crazy
853.14,856.32, people are so getting boy or getting called
856.32,858.78, and like a man
858.9,863.16, in my opinion i think there is the definition of what normal is
863.25,889.05, everybody's wadinoon way and i think that people should just learn how the embrace themselves for whom they are you
890.97,892.5, everybody else
892.89,894.54, like this
894.63,899.28, he is so in the upset world
899.37,900.81, make the
901.5,906.63, it's a lie that you tell yourself hey i'm i'm normal 
906.84,912.78, the master is really you in front of every one and everybody has that mask
913.05,913.86, and
913.86,925.05, today i hope that just
925.38,928.11, i gets out and people
928.35,932.13, learn something from that and that may be still swindle can
932.52,940.17, hope rope that boys are heard and that changed to happen
940.83,942.15, for
943.29,963.15, really the sanity and the sea of everybody's sufferings madness what i hope for is that no people will see this videoing change and that more evenly this happened more discussion
963.15,964.59, about this
964.77,979.53, undergraduate opportunity to be here and to say with folks like this an folks like the guide i hope cuspidors some schools and
979.53,980.94, he
981.18,989.28, in school social
