0.03,9.96, hello my name is alice osborne i am an editor
9.99,11.46, a coach
11.46,20.52, power singer song writer my business write from the inside out is over ten years old and in that time i've taught workshops and fiction
20.55,104.31, in poetry and i love helping writers become published authors if you're looking for a book coach her a few things that i would recommend how diverse in deep is their education and how many clients have they served over the years i would also look at their website i would also look at their log and the writing style i was able to succeed while out of my colleagues were struggling was because of my education i do have a graduate degree in english and rhetoric composition from and state i had to defend a thesis that i wrote all of that is a wonderful beating process because if you do that then you are really on your way to being a professional writing professional not quite because there's still a lot more to go perhaps to learn about being an editor about being a writer but if you've written a fiction it i would say that a really good indicator that your serious and you know what you're talking about when it comes to literature and theory benefits being featured and a local bookstore are three so you get your local fans together and they publicize for you and they yoursal people to you
104.7,201.6, you have the ability to have photos taken and video taken at the event and you can market all of that media at later date and three if you're able to contact online media through newspaper radio t v you can get mediator event and what that means is free publicity they can write your even up in the paper they can write about what you do how you help people and that will generate even more branding more marketing more publicity for you and also sails for you so is a threefold process of getting out there and having a local event a book marketing consultant can help authors get into bookstores by giving them a list of book stores that are willing and able to feature authors they should also have a connection with the book stores themselves not to say oh here's a list they have actually been at that bookstore they've been posted by that book store they can also help you with immediate list so that you don't have to spend the time figuring out who this person is or this person is in the numbers and the mails and the website and that they have also relationships with those folks too perhaps that person is the coach has used that media person so that their client can also use that media person so it's a whole connection the goals that i would recommend an author have before getting a book launch organized would be okay i want to have thirty people calm that's a good amount of phil up the room i want to have maybe
201.75,287.85, fifteen books so sound a little bit low but this event is not just about selling books it's also publicizing for the sales of future books so that would be a very reasonable goal you can also say well i want to have a really good food and to have live entertainment having an organized program and making sure that it had a good time the advice i would give someone who is wanting to have a book launch at a local bookstore would be first be a customer of the bookstore or be a volunteer that book store get to know the book store way before your book is even in procession is talked to them a man author i want to learn as much as i can i don't know but i'm willing to learn kind of attitude and tonewerot that store at ten the events at ten the free events and if you keep showing up as they will that person is really serious and there making an investment in their time and money especially if you are buying books from that local bookstore bookstores are really great for bounces but sometimes there's no traditional space is too i had a friend where she had a book launched the talbots and hellbeam to her because she's a regular shop her there and they had a cake and refreshments and they did all the social media for her it may be a good idea to combine book stores but with another venue to
288.36,309.93, independent publishing is a wonderful avenue for someone who's considering where i should publish my book yes traditional publishing can be more of a betting process with the reviews or if you're looking at being a professor and you need to have that publishing tradition publishing credit that's important to career
309.96,351.87, for all other avenues i would say self publishing is the way to go because you have control over when your book is published you're not at the whims of other books on the publishing house schedule you have say in what your cover looks like and the international publishers they'll say no let's say you're an african american person and they say well you can only write this and say i want to write this and that's not the tell you what your audiences and i've heard this happen and maybe you don't want to be put in a box
