0.39,10.62, teetotalers
12.51,16.17, is only a conspiracy theory until
16.56,65.31, it's this proved and if it's not this proved that it becomes conspiracy fact welcome the sky watched bitterer to ten i dare especial daily updates today as we agustin studio who will be featured on several of coming episodes of the over the air broadcast of scythes the author of a couple of best selling books you've heard of the rebound the sand borers new book it when the lion roars understanding the implications of ancient prophecies for our time we are pleased to welcome castlesteads lie veterans
65.49,72.42, the beginning of the oba administration and then kind of went away and this was the issue of
72.45,94.23, president's birth certificate yea which is a very important issue now to determine if it's a legitimate certificate and thus an identifying document this legitimate then he is legitimate everything about his sitting in the white house as the commander in chief is legitimate yet if it's not legitimate
94.71,115.68, we've got a problem because of its not legitimate that means is fabricated that means several crimes have been committed and i'm not saying by the president himself that saying he fabricated the document but if he did some if somebody did crimes have been committed if you and i fabricate a driver's license right here to day just the fact that we did it
115.83,124.59, crime whether we ever use it if we're caught with a fabricated valid and to crime if i use it it's another crime
124.68,139.83, if i use it to gain gain assets and another crime if i use it to gain an employment that another crime if i got it publicly as my abetter crime so
140.13,182.82, the issue of the birth certificate the long form besetteth the obaa administration posted on the white house website in april is an important thing to look at and i know that it's been maligned by the side operation and everybody collinsia words the washington post in your teamsters and all that conspiracy fearing at that musical had nothing to do with bertha looking at that burst pacificate from a criminal law enforcement forensic investigation had nothing to do with where the present was born it had everything to do with all the crimes i just talked to the authenticity of the docket
183.0,200.61, if it's not then o my gosh not only have a plethora of crimes been committed but then you have to ask the question why why would a sitting president and or his administration around him take the chance of committing those kinds of crimes that want of back up say something interesting to your audience don't forget
200.79,202.47, the person responsible
202.47,210.75, getting that long form both long for both certificate posted on the white house website was a man by the name of donald trump
211.92,213.87, he wasn't running for president
214.08,225.87, he also was concerned as a lot of other business people were he knew people like sheriff jorio was the one investigating who would be the one investigating this thing but
225.99,227.34, but he
227.67,229.41, challenged the present
229.71,299.4, i think it was five million he offered maybe more i don't remember nobody offered him millions of dollars to give to his favorite when he called it a charitable weetamoo give to his favorite charity if he would put some identifying open up his record he didn't ask him to put a bustification although that was the hot point topic but but obaa the first executive order he signed on the very first day he took office you can go to the government website and read it yourself was to lock down all of his identifying records are lot of people out that was in the january thornhirst two thousand nine the day after his inauguration he shuts down the very thing but by two thousand eleven were getting ready to go into the two thousand twelve election there still no that valid identifying document that has ever been released and people are questioning what if the guy's not even from here now that's where the birthrate started originate from here that's another whole argument right but the question became when donald trump stepped forward and started bad during emanating millions of dollars to your favorite charity
300.42,305.28, then april twenty eleven appears this long formed artifice
305.28,366.27, interestingly which some of his spokes people had said previously that hawaii didn't even issue a long form or difficult so you we can't put one up there but all of a sudden one appear this thing that couldn't be done all of a sudden is done which immediately raised people suspicious why should we buy every government narrative say that's what the main stream media wants us to it we say it believe it well i wish we lived in that kind of a world but we don't so you know i come from a law enforcement background just because somebody tells me they didn't commit a crime doellinger you didn't do it katherine around it one of the mean time sheriff gomeril be county he was petitioned by two hundred and something of his constituents he said look what if the certificate is fraudulent that means that document was put up there before the twenty twelve election to prove his identity if its fraudulent we might have been defrauded in
366.33,443.91, had a fraud committed against us in the election america bacon because we ate was on the ballot in continents that's how it all came to the serfs had looked i'll look into it so he commissioned mike zooloo was on the coal case possunt at the time but his investigative experience and back in the east and new jersey new york i think in law enforcement but anyway he was serving with our pipestone to be the chief investigator of this and there stated expressed purpose which is on record in writing an invidious they wanted to clear the document then wanted to exonerate the present neither one of them believed that the thing could be false bottom line let me get to the short story in the bring you up to what we now know which is profound they started investigating the document in august thuvia to press conferences shortly thereafter wherein they said we tried the clear but we can't there some suspicious suspicious things about the document it does not appear to be valiauntly first of all they're all kind of layers and different anomalies of moon looking at all that there annotating that it was layers of an image that the warlike pieces of the image at laborious it was tampering
443.91,457.53, we all just assumed all of us that were connected to law enforcement and now we just assume oh yes this is no brighter at least look at it i mean let congress clear let the bi clear it you know but nobody would touch it
