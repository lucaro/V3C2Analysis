703.86,712.41, trying to get rid of judging is another judgment in an abbot self
712.86,719.61, we noticed a judging and then we say to ourselves i shouldn't be judging
720.0,725.58, an that's more judgment we judge ourselves
726.06,729.93, we have standards of what is acceptable
730.44,733.74, and what is unacceptable
735.51,740.82, i come into a pigeon on the other side
741.12,748.98, so this time you'll take your left me forward to your left wrist take your right leg back and long

876.03,904.11, so on tuesday of this past week i went on what i would call a bender of judgment and it was remorsefully directed mostly at the ones they love the most in this world and then on wednesday i woke up with full of regret and remorse
907.47,924.66, so tuesday the judgment was directed towards them in trinity and wednesday the judgment was turned and directed towards myself i was full of self criticism and self loathing for all the judgment that i had directed outwards
926.07,934.44, that's come upwards and come into a twist saturn towards your bent left leg
946.14,947.28, he
956.61,970.83, then come back to the center going to switch sides in to try and switch up my man but so this is lespel
974.61,984.33, so this time you're going to walk your right leg through and levantine post
984.78,997.23, so jauntily to understand the judging mind we need to touch it with a forgiving heart
998.73,1010.79, jack cornfield says to become fully conscious we must allow each difficult state we have rejected including our judging mind
1010.91,1013.52, to come back into our heart
1040.79,1046.34, he then pressed into your front foot and will come into the twist on the side
1070.61,1076.16, a man came back to the centre
1076.67,1082.64, and i am really grateful that kneeling part of this class is over let me tell you
1083.39,1094.19, oh my god in two spendings wide tucker toes under come into downward facing dog
1095.24,1102.59, and i from here going to make your way up to standing
1104.96,1122.6, from saving or going to do a couple of variations on eagle's post we were going to do its day is you going to put your feet together and you're going to sit back
1123.14,1137.09, still a bouncing post because you're narrowing her basis support and then you're going to give yourself a hug so said doing full at eagles arms you're going to give yourself a hung here and back
1137.87,1159.77, so my teacher reggie raywood say it differently than gathorne instead of coming into your heart he would say when self judgment comes up we need to come fully into our bodies and be present with what's happening and what a rising in our lives at the moment
1186.65,1216.86, gradually that self criticism is a way of avoiding what is rising in the present moment and so that when self criticism and judgment comes up that it's an opportunity for us to come back into our bodies and to re align ourselves with what is actually arising in the present moment
1228.56,1232.1, he switched the amatongo
1245.66,1251.78, then come up to standing your indostan at the top of your man now
1255.74,1262.97, and we're going to do a version of peaceful warrior
1266.36,1279.02, so going to take a big step back with your right foot and take your arms straight up
1279.11,1286.64, take your right arm back and you're going to lean back so your allowing the judgment to be present
1287.99,1306.62, so it radiates is that when self criticism comes up is completely out of alignment with our version of what we think is acceptable for ourselves
1335.51,1338.36, then let this pose out of your body
1338.84,1343.28, come and stand at the top of your man
1352.49,1357.44, so sometimes the things that are coming up in our lives are very painful
1357.98,1387.2, judgment rage and anger these things are completely inconsistent with our image of ourselves and there completely at aliment with our self image when we feel anger and rage and judgments our beliefs about who we are as a person are being called into question in its painful and stabilizing and threatening
1387.29,1388.46, he
1402.23,1403.01, he
1414.62,1418.28, sally come up to standing

1745.52,1860.96, and then come up again to ford told her when we judge ourselves and reggie explained that this is a discursive way of jumping to conclusions about what is coming up for selves we start spinning or thoughts start paying and that this thinking and spinning is a way of avoiding what is actually happening for us and what is being asked when judging is happening for us is to come back into her bodies just need to be present to what is happening now seacome upright you're going to switch her legs read that whole sequence on the other side to start with a twist and then with
