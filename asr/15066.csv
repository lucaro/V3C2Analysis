6.0,11.49, i 
11.52,18.24, my name is freddy perritaut director of the foundation of indianapolis of guatemala
18.51,21.36, single anton to the head
22.65,25.56, a prime canderdate
26.01,28.41, this palace
28.83,33.69, i got involved in this but mister i mean i
34.2,38.16, it snow and letting linford
38.37,41.85, he was working here since and when he invited me to come
41.85,43.23, seeing what happened
43.38,51.84, maybe the communities seeing the necessity of finding a love on the one missing for decades it quickly to me in
52.05,54.39, and i felt
54.42,63.33, with the people mostly the work of one
63.36,64.14, effects
64.98,70.08, i do i mean that has completely changed my life it has 
70.92,75.99, first thing it has made me realize that i am very fortunate
76.08,76.98, and
77.22,81.15, i grew up in this country and i was able to leave when i was lying
81.45,94.89, many of the families that will work with a lot of fortunate taunting a lot of them were executed others will disappear others later the mountains without food or shelter first years at a time
95.16,97.71, the first thing that makes me do it makes me humble
97.95,100.65, makes me realize how fortunate i am
101.04,113.76, it also makes me feel very honored to be able to be in such a position of responsibility that allows me to reunite families with the more
119.79,125.28, and we look for the people that nobody else cares for besides the love one
125.61,128.91, pain and anguish helps us feel
129.0,132.36, continue the work as it has to continue
132.81,135.0, i guess the most
135.72,137.49, and part of it is
137.67,139.05, what was you
139.89,144.84, what would you want something to do if someone in your family disappeared
145.02,146.28, your son
146.52,149.43, husband your father disappeared
150.87,152.58, would you want to want to do
152.97,154.38, and that's what we try to
164.61,166.95, something so powerful
168.63,171.93, pain the impotence
172.2,173.61, sense of
173.73,179.34, that every one of those family members have rose to every one that wore the
179.55,181.02, we use that to
181.47,185.58, to try to find that this appeared and
186.18,193.08, at the same time they give us to strength to be looked to continue and that where i refuse to stop
193.14,200.73, for i was used to just let it go because i know that the second was stopped in this here one malaprop and
209.82,214.71, the friendly centralisation of guatemala has worked
215.16,220.38, to day about eighteen hundred in six cases we have recovered
221.28,237.54, over seven thousand remains and have identified close to thirty five hundred of those what has happened more recently as we began to look for the people who in disappeared saying what malliere between the people that will massacre
238.41,249.6, family members witnesses know where the person is but i have had to wait for decades were betimes and to revere up
250.05,252.99, in the case of the disappeared
253.11,270.51, i don't know where they are so we began the search and i think that has been our greatest achievement has been to be able to provide an avenue of hope for the family members to be able to search for for the love looking back
270.57,272.28, i never imagined
273.12,275.82, being where i am to day i mean
276.39,282.84, when i started here there was only five people and we relieved i know the extent
282.96,289.26, the damage in other words that there was people disappeared or that two hundred thousand victims
290.22,298.17, the result of his own conflict so through the years everything that we accomplished was step by step
298.23,311.04, and at the same time helping so many family numbers to search for the lovels helping some of them to find them a one and to be able to 
311.37,314.43, bury them in a dignified way
314.55,322.65, everything i think from the moment i came in animality to now has been a venture and something that atoner imagined
323.4,329.82, the work that we do changes lives at the very basic level it allows people
330.03,331.62, in truth
332.1,337.95, allows people to come to terms with the terrible reality that the low ones are dead
338.34,349.14, every one that we work with has the hope still now thirty three years later there four years later they all have the hope that their family member the love one would be alive
349.47,353.04, but when they begin to look for them with us without help
353.04,354.87, excepting that the dead
355.83,357.84, change them in that way
357.93,359.22, that
360.24,365.16, make him look into a reality that they avoided for beads
365.52,367.2, when we do find them
368.58,370.77, explosion of emotion
370.83,374.43, happiness to sorrow to
376.74,378.12, empowerment
381.75,384.51, changes every part
385.17,392.46, that person's being and then what i think is important is that it allows the person to focus on their future
392.67,399.06, there's a sense of responsibility in what we do and that sense of responsibility
400.98,407.46, drown me in and allowed me to to expand on and the work that lies started
407.7,411.12, entreaties oasis
411.45,412.68, one
413.25,414.81, speak softly
415.95,417.33, you know how to listen
417.78,420.09, and
420.18,426.48, with the bold with the remains and the families with tenement these families
426.6,428.46, then the heroes in this
428.85,440.13, our roles miniscule is almost non existent without the families pashepaho these brave women that have led
440.94,450.54, the search for the disappeared in argentina and chile one mile without this woman we wouldn't be doing what we do because what we're doing is at their service
