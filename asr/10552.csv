6.03,13.71, well the last few questions shortly justinian first of all we're going to do our increased
14.01,15.03, the myth
15.27,21.33, i will be safe to stay during a bush fire if i cleared all the vegetation from around my house
21.78,23.43, a house might have break
24.39,25.86, i have a bunk
26.58,28.65, water tank to hide in
28.74,30.09, pestem
31.23,37.8, he can protect me not to hide in my ain i house can protect me from a bush fire five
42.66,44.31, he
45.15,48.45, it 
52.95,65.4, going there as cannot protect me from a bush fire and listening to the capital program will abate you think just was the answer at
68.52,72.93, a situation where the fire bearing down on us
74.1,80.91, a pretty much in a situation where you as will protect you from a bush fire because geronimo
81.21,92.13, and if you leave the house you isolated to risk another fold and if he may be has the human cargo
92.55,96.45, only better than lady has on to
98.1,109.11, cause in many cases when there is an adequate warning of animating fire is your place of protection
110.37,114.99, that then draws an eternity to
115.56,121.47, the one of his cousins and he occupies to understand the specific is
121.98,128.1, and tiredness measures to manage that is
128.82,132.36, given that the fantastic
132.99,135.0, you know amenothes
135.9,141.27, i think they need to be a clear distinction here between a house
143.28,145.92, protecting you in the sense
145.98,148.26, from
148.32,151.74, in a half for some protection while your
152.01,154.71, finding that the property so
154.98,160.71, the mistakes that people make will be to think that the house is a safe place it's not necessarily
160.86,174.0, probably a law is option and providing you got hold of other things in place it will extend and improve you some and a protection to exclusive the situation
174.0,176.43, we need to get away from the idea that
176.7,179.22, a house is going to protect me
179.22,185.97, without any for the work as distinct from a house in combination with a whole lot of other actions and the
186.6,187.86, options
188.82,193.35, a high chance of surviving i think we may actually change that process
193.74,208.14, that courage in a people want to have the sort of simple views of the will of man we alternate sarasota and getting that idea of more complex spread out risks across is quite difficult
208.26,232.89, i think that's probably true but i think there's a maliseet and if you hear the experts talking around but then the talking about the house in refection they have this wonderful socio technical language that they use elisabeth has by live here my photographs to the dissection that if you provide people informed consent they make the decisions that they will then be logical rational beings
233.49,256.29, you all of the interview work and stuff is people make bad decisions and situation because of their emotional attachment because of the cottonopolis value of the house to him so i think to develop strategies that assumed that the individual is a perfectly rational creature and it's just a lackington or a lack of technical risk assessment criteria
256.77,274.29, close the outcome that we think it is so i think we have to be very clear understanding that the emotional symbolic and cultural value of the house or whatever other passaporte were talking about that i have on and colleagues are doing some work in this area of the moment before one of the biggest
274.44,277.56, reason behind you is pete
278.13,283.44, effect ahorse were dogs lay pale to make the most do
283.74,285.39, a decision
287.49,297.96, thinking about the life diamantiferous i found a grass follows kind of things i think we have to be really careful and we have to spend a long time thinking in understanding
298.62,303.0, how that draws the decision may he had tried to deal with making
303.36,309.93, the moon the church that those factors will distort the sitting position technical experts
309.96,317.43, think about that and professes it was so that people are necessarily responding in the waist i had
318.15,323.01, it struck me when i saw that story the first one went away armenian men was that
323.22,332.07, perception of the sky from these fires and united standard the house with the housatonic
332.1,334.89, i guess occasionally happens but
335.07,341.01, sort of fire storm of you landsturmer common kind of scenario for him as in busy
341.67,350.79, in fact it heaps of behaves in different stages of the fire that the strafing embraces
350.88,353.22, the intensity
354.36,358.62, francoise in the wind's bright through
359.01,361.56, the 
363.48,368.1, the intestines isolating with that is actually a lot of
368.46,376.14, robert billeviches in the gates and in the crevices were
376.2,377.88, he
378.09,380.25, the
380.28,384.21, and he made things a patient
385.05,388.35, if you please of an area and the house
388.59,390.63, it makes
391.08,394.11, have you aretino
394.29,399.99, i think it's really important to have some defendable by some way a different work from
399.99,404.79, don't guarantee anything but at least you a chance i think there are a lot of situations with
404.82,409.05, he brought up pastoralist a fine flock the forest
409.26,413.04, aleister
413.91,420.72, hesitate actually the some of the fuel around close to the house you really name to
420.87,433.8, and maintain a property in a way so that you can have but dependable space in its dependable not too mysterious protector home but also to a safe place for you to work so
433.89,435.99, certainly isaac
436.02,444.63, remove some of the fuel around the house but you've got to be cleaned the not all vegetation is necessarily was a model burnet's not all
444.63,448.77, it feels the neatly live in a desert
448.86,457.89, in that sort of environment there is the components of filmore than the lot of the lestranges for example
457.92,460.05, a useful 
461.97,474.33, cantinet it is an option at could be considered but i guess it is a resolution is not please solution because i've got to get to the banker
474.63,494.25, then you know to be able to survive in the bank or for the period of time at the finsteraarhorn anyone who apply eggs into the emancipation if you if you expectation is the banker is it
494.43,508.89, the almost certainly be a proof may be that you dog gone astray it may be that you think caught out somewhere away from your house you know not option so unless you get at opens
510.48,536.76, really running a very severe risk of bacon the fare because i guess that once again the way humanitate is a case of anabasis that is that way till making as etranger of that kind of solution while i make the cold of night covered the one man's poperinghe mesopotamia hostesses the operator
538.68,540.57, and i think it's
541.29,545.31, we don't really understand the early how people thinking
545.88,553.23, situation particularly important i think there's been a lot of work over last couple of years in looking in emergency evacuation of aeroplane
553.29,560.25, i think this a lot of valuable stuff that we can learn from them to what we know that research is that people
562.11,565.62, a panic doesn't lay ostentatious before
565.83,574.62, at this just to guarding for the play it was cases so i think there has to be a lot more understanding of
574.71,586.98, social construction of risk how we actually i understand how we value our houses and perhaps have to re educating people to actually have that conversation because when the pricking in at the fire
587.4,589.29, i like staying
589.59,607.29, go back up to all the distaff and your photographs and were outside of the bush fires of a pusillanimous about paperhanging to stay and calling down of the indigenes or you know just really strange behaviour of the tumefaction al but when you actually think about meantersay and contain
610.77,616.71, i think the world and of experience the inside discussing these things with
619.47,622.05, the people that had
622.17,626.34, themselves with the sand understanding of bush fireside
626.67,631.02, the characteristics of bush fire more type and the different
631.35,636.48, circumstances and onesicritus ances are really made where the context
638.25,646.62, the paper that will less cold out o didn't transition into an extreme antedating
646.71,649.26, of irrational decisions
649.5,651.27, they actually
651.39,653.28, rothesel
653.31,654.9, i would say
655.86,657.69, comfortable with
657.93,662.94, the farming passed and now on top of the time friends and
663.09,668.04, and and of course it's instants to the next person on the street 
671.01,675.3, i think that there may be some home truths that 
675.48,677.58, part of that part of the
678.24,680.49, solution is
681.09,682.59, getting 
682.92,688.77, clear understanding of what bush fires can do and what things around them can do under those conditions
689.13,703.41, we also know that they can be paradoxical effects i think the somebody came gatekeepers and knowledge and we see them number of cases where individuals had been offered were about they were itching to have a go at a fire
703.83,721.68, the traditional original policy was if there's a fire give the hellebore that is of just get there on a here some time he bought me an opposition where you could learn them in it and can have a false sense of mastery of the situation and i'm not saying that's always the case but i'm saying is that these are the incomplete human behavior
721.89,727.08, that some time little bit of knowledge could even in a paradoxical producing
728.01,736.14, we donations but it's really important that we understand that he antiquite complex
738.69,741.57, of behavior and many of the people staring
741.57,752.4, a quite logical rational physicists and chemists cabassole who ever etheloid views of the world has been of a misbecoming the i think we need to understand that much better
752.67,756.3, i think that is a very important in one 
756.3,762.6, an ex question i think next minute for you as to a spot which you doing pretty well so far i must say
763.68,769.86, don't have to relieve done everything to see if it recommends to repay my house and property
787.95,795.57, well have to really get at the that did you answer 
796.62,799.29, i guess you can stay there for the fire
799.68,801.99, and so
802.17,803.49, enter
805.47,808.95, when you entirely make a ten
810.54,818.25, i guess context is really important here and it's happened question without the context
818.4,821.37, he just made good example i guess 
821.4,825.24, no knowledge and iron is
826.53,829.77, in the sense that if you haven't got the corresponding
829.8,831.51, experience to go with it
831.51,833.82, less well equipped
833.85,835.77, i guess we saw of
837.24,848.76, rations if you like to say we don't want people gaping at the fire even without people interfering with her description and yet we want them to be experienced when it comes to a war for situation
848.91,854.16, maybe tis an opportunity there actually have more committee involvement in some of the
854.4,866.13, that the safety and the horror issues in havana but but that part of the reality of man forgetting this forenoon we need to be more engaged in it i think
866.52,871.14, one of the difficulties of answering a question like this it depends very much when you experience as well
873.15,878.1, and the degrading these
878.22,881.73, i recommended in your patouillet
881.82,885.6, dismember the community
885.6,899.04, everything possible they've got their degree in a bush by behaving said and then tethered it's the penteconter question
899.1,899.97, this
900.06,903.09, how bad is the forward
903.15,908.13, and i was really pleased to see a broad distribution answers because in fact
908.25,910.8, the point that we
911.01,915.6, try and prepare ourselves or educate actually ashamed
915.78,921.09, a range of potential for where there's an for were the behind us and
921.15,926.19, he often reminds us that that's just a riant the one
927.39,930.15, easily and
930.63,932.43, it's really important
932.64,934.92, the old south people
935.76,943.29, understanding of a when a wearing that in that wide her actually sitting in any given event
946.5,948.78, he has some independent
948.99,953.91, drowsily divided is to be able to midicine america
954.42,956.22, anything you want to say
956.25,962.76, to the tay that i folenfant's libertarian forgive is that
963.18,969.21, want to tell people how i belive and if there's a lot to come out petitions and to shout
971.01,976.05, but more of the view that the role of the state and policy is to
976.05,986.43, the paper went the most deformed decision possible but after mantelish chooses to leave in the particular area the state can say while we may not be covering to rescue
986.46,999.36, that is nice the risk in new ideas arise there and said well it's going to be catastrophic day of his going into malvoisin and i made quite happy with that resolute are some really interesting philosophical questions 
999.42,1003.86, level about the extent to which the state henneleinlein
1003.86,1006.56, what actually desirable 
1006.56,1007.82, i 
1007.82,1019.07, interesting whether these whether the state can say look you a dietary be able to get in and savans like you go cut you off can the state do that i can imagine them
1022.1,1039.08, i degenerated
