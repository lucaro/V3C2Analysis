439.98,445.47, out of the ranks of the philistines and spoke the same words as before
446.04,447.81, david heard him
449.37,457.2, david said to saul let no one's heart fail be conception your servant will go and fight with this philistine
457.86,465.12, said to david you are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for you are just a boy
465.27,468.39, he has been a warrior from his youth
469.14,470.91, david said to saul
471.45,474.72, servant used to keep sheep for his father
474.99,479.16, whenever a lion or a barricade and took a lamb from the flock

519.87,527.22, so closed david with his armour he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail
527.94,534.54, stratford over the armor and he tried in vain to look for he was not used to them
535.14,540.9, i said to so i cannot walk with these for i am not used to them
541.17,543.0, david removed the
543.18,545.4, a statesman
545.46,553.44, chose five smooth stones from the wady and put them in his shepherd's bag in the pouch
553.65,555.63, in the instant
555.81,558.3, and he drew near the philistine
558.45,567.51, the philistine came on and drew near the day but with the shield bearer in front of him when the fellow seemed looked inside david he disdained him
567.51,574.59, he was only a youth ruddy and handsome in appearance the philistine said to david
574.74,578.07, a dog that you come to me dick
578.31,581.76, the philistine curtain by his gods
581.88,584.07, stainton

619.05,620.94, the birds of the air
621.24,623.91, to the wild animals of the earth
623.91,639.42, so that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel and that all this assembly may know that the lord does not save by sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands
640.53,643.86, when the first time drew nearer to me david
644.13,647.88, david ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the philistine
648.78,651.18, put his hand in his bag
651.57,653.19, the stone
653.4,654.75, slung it
655.05,657.96, struck the philistine on his forehead
658.89,661.53, so saying into his forehead
661.68,664.92, he fell face down on the ground
670.2,680.01, let us pray father in the name of jesus we come before you with humble hearts hood
681.42,684.69, asking you to forgive us horses

727.89,731.91, even when times are hard
732.48,735.54, like david felt
737.19,744.84, when he had to take down the with but just like you love david we understand that you are a lie
745.17,746.88, most of all
747.36,748.98, asked that
749.13,750.3, you meet
750.3,753.27, every one in the center of their needs
754.41,756.54, love one needs

782.88,786.0, i say
786.15,790.83, see
791.07,796.26, he is a 
796.32,801.84, the harbor
802.02,802.86, he
805.86,808.92, on
809.85,819.51, enter
825.09,839.1, it ideally
839.61,860.01, waeinaemoeinen too
865.32,871.89, he
871.98,884.7, another
885.24,887.88, he
889.23,894.45, the somal
899.67,904.35, the series
906.48,909.48, he 
910.29,916.23, the man
916.47,919.8, and
931.32,947.52, i 
947.55,957.18, i mayaro
957.54,964.41, he
969.09,976.44, samuel satin is the story of a boy who just now is going to do big things
976.83,983.37, the chapter just before the verses for today samuel the prophet sneaks into the home of jesse
984.03,986.37, so the king will find out
986.67,989.61, indeed as the new king
990.54,996.72, this chapter david who isn't yet old enough to join the israeli army
996.93,1001.7, only in camp because jesse sent him with some food for his older brothers
1002.18,1006.14, that's when he hears the talk of this giant philistine
1007.91,1010.4, israel is army
1012.41,1015.47, as the path that god will see him through the battle
1015.71,1018.2, this towering adversary
1019.37,1023.45, this point in his life david is not imposing at all
1024.77,1025.76, so
1025.79,1031.01, retire was chosen in part for his impressive stature he was over six feet tall
1031.04,1033.44, abroad he was muscular
1033.47,1035.42, looked the part of a king
1035.78,1040.61, with so small into garrison that sells armored in them a chance of even fitting him
1040.91,1042.74, i couldn't even walk in it
1043.52,1044.96, he with
1044.99,1047.18, are even more
1047.87,1053.9, it was a full six cubit in height at five feet two point one five meters
1054.89,1057.8, david probably reached half of them
1057.98,1059.27, a sample
1059.99,1065.15, and an impressive bronze armor when a hundred and twenty five pounds
1065.27,1069.8, epigrams which is probably what david himself waited
1070.07,1071.75, spirit
1072.68,1074.6, pounds
1074.6,1076.22, so nora
1076.46,1078.17, it was sharp and broad
1078.47,1087.23, that to david's five smooth stones the probably weighed less than a pound when put all together
1088.28,1089.72, was
1093.95,1095.33, brothers knowing
1095.39,1097.82, look completely one time
1098.06,1099.23, the quick
1100.19,1102.11, overseas
1103.76,1104.93, the point
1106.01,1111.11, reason we know that david is going to do big things is because he's not counting on his own strength
1111.92,1115.04, the strength of his arms or even the strength of his mind
1115.52,1119.75, able to accomplish these things he's coming on the strength of god
1120.32,1122.78, mind and his heart are set on god's poor
1124.07,1125.3, as a shepherd
1125.33,1131.54, protected his family flock from bears and lions that were far larger than he himself
1132.47,1134.87, david doesn't attribute that ability
1135.08,1136.94, dunmore
1137.03,1138.77, if it was his own strength
1138.77,1140.0, still
1141.14,1143.81, he sees it as god working through him
1144.98,1150.2, uncircumcised philistine will be like one of them is what he says to solve
1151.19,1154.7, the battle is also completely one side
1155.15,1159.32, it should be quick get won't even raise the sweat
1162.98,1164.45, it
1164.93,1167.6, prevailed over the philistine
1167.84,1169.01, a sling
1169.4,1170.78, a single stone
1171.41,1174.02, striking down the philistine and killing him
1174.26,1177.02, as no sword in david's hand
1177.92,1186.11, so what you not yet a military age takes down the best and i do mean that on military threat in his time
1187.52,1190.43, it was just the first of david's victories
1190.43,1198.44, i grunted israel's army through countless victories time and time again always counting
1198.68,1201.2, our god to bring it through
1202.31,1205.16, this would be our first point for today
1205.73,1213.23, our lives we will undoubtedly face seemingly insurmountable obstacles that will stand in our way
1213.74,1217.01, the way of living out god's way for our lives
1217.61,1221.6, battles might look to every one around us
1222.23,1223.67, honest
1224.27,1225.56, now
1225.74,1229.01, they are completely one sided against 
1229.07,1232.76, in those times of being hopelessly outmatched
1233.42,1237.41, we need to set our minds in our hearts on the power of god
1238.01,1241.67, knowing that whatever our adversary might be
1242.06,1244.07, the adversary
1244.19,1246.35, hopelessly outmatched
1246.47,1248.48, the power of god to save
1250.01,1256.43, simply does not matter what bears or lions or philistines are cruelly arrayed against us
1256.79,1258.38, single stone
1258.65,1259.73, the out
1260.93,1261.98, one
1262.73,1272.69, the rock on which we stand the corner stone the lord whose power so dwarfs the glass of our experience is to make them insignificant
1273.44,1275.27, only we trust god
1275.72,1277.64, so that it
1278.42,1284.45, i would be remiss in my duties of correctly divining the word of god if i didn't go on the issue
1284.48,1285.77, a few more
1286.85,1289.25, in his youthful faith
1289.28,1294.17, i think ever conceived in a situation where god might not rescue him
1295.1,1300.29, to be sure we in our lives will face a number of situations
1302.45,1303.44, not
1304.1,1306.8, out of the pain and the suffering
1308.0,1313.76, in his ministry faced off against the political and religious powers of his day
1313.88,1314.99, times
1315.71,1316.64, and
1316.91,1319.16, all but the last he was kept safe
1320.57,1323.48, the protection of god book here
1326.66,1329.78, no power succeed in putting him to death
1332.24,1336.11, and that included the feeding death itself
1336.5,1338.81, christ will observe
1339.83,1346.67, hours of this world's victory were short lived when god vindicated jesus by raising him from the dead
1347.69,1348.77, i
1349.28,1354.5, the postilion perhaps of them were eventually killed by the powers of their day
1362.06,1365.87, every manner that was known to that time they were put to death
1367.04,1371.09, and even though we have not yet seen them raised in vindication
1371.39,1376.01, and look at the works and the writings that have inspired the church through the centuries
1376.1,1381.8, can be no doubt that god used them both in life and in death in powerful ways
1381.86,1383.57, they are indicated
1383.96,1386.24, the results that we still seek to day
1386.87,1389.0, words still inspires
1390.05,1391.34, the second point
1391.85,1400.91, he went to those times when god be not savour from the suffering and loss god will still vindicate us in life or into
1401.48,1403.04, we can stay
1403.73,1407.09, i know that my redeemer lives and he
1407.09,1408.83, as me up on the last day
1410.84,1413.96, difference between god guarantee or sixty
1414.05,1417.02, and god insuring our vindication is
1417.44,1419.84, it is very important
1420.38,1430.52, it is easy in our humanness to slip from county in god's power to save us from our enemies into calling in god's power to destroy our enemies
1431.3,1434.66, think of the same fair and edication david himself
1434.84,1435.92, that
1436.49,1443.06, it seems that david's faith we not have ever grown out of that early sure any of god's protection
1443.48,1446.57, into that deeper understanding of guns than cation
1447.89,1451.61, it may be a part what led david to his greatest error
1451.7,1453.23, in his life
1453.68,1456.95, it's reasonable to think that david beheld
1457.34,1462.62, knowing that god's power would allow him to surmount him possible as in the thinking
1463.82,1465.02, anything
1466.01,1473.51, from knowing that he would be blessed that ever god called him to do into thinking the god would bless him whatever he chose to do
1473.84,1475.85, after david made that mistake
1476.15,1480.95, when he sent a man to his death so that david could take his wife from self
1482.66,1487.4, the danger of thinking that god will bless our prices
1488.06,1495.47, david was good enough to know in his heart that this was wrong and he repented fervently when he was confronted with him
1497.09,1499.52, we must guard ourselves from david a
1500.45,1502.13, must see pass
1502.16,1505.46, she thinking that god is on our side
1506.3,1507.98, understand clearly
1508.07,1509.81, it is we
1509.81,1512.93, must be on god's side
1514.91,1523.28, one had a right to ask god for vengeance against his enemies it would be somewhat like the german pastor martin memory
1524.09,1528.35, protested hitler's antisemitic agenda in person
1528.65,1530.03, before the furor
1531.44,1534.05, course he was promptly arrested and imprisoned
1534.08,1535.37, years
1536.06,1538.4, expound in gotha
1539.51,1543.44, here is how he responded to that great injustice
1544.07,1550.37, so it took me a long time to learn that god is not the enemy of my enemies
1550.97,1554.3, it is not even the enemy of god and is
1555.59,1557.27, and at
1557.33,1563.87, outcast once advised her that when god hates all the same people that we hate
1564.32,1567.65, you can be sure that we have created god in our own image
1568.22,1569.36, i don't
1570.83,1576.02, to to see those others not as enemies but as neighbors
1576.38,1578.09, children of god
1578.15,1581.63, by god as much as we are
1583.16,1585.38, brings us to that fine point
1586.64,1595.13, story of david helps us see the power of god that can be active in our lives and bring about the wise impossible victories
1595.52,1599.03, we must see what it appears to vininese
1599.57,1609.62, must see that god's power to achieve great things is not for the purpose of crushing one's enemies or even crushing those who we believe are the enemies of god
1610.49,1615.44, a power to achieve great things it only truly the access
1615.74,1620.12, we tear down those false boundaries that create that deadly lie
1620.33,1622.31, there are some people who are
1624.56,1627.89, as a solitaire for god to rebuke
1628.4,1631.7, troy and utterly ninety memory
1631.79,1633.17, his enemies
1634.1,1642.23, in order for us to truly worship and serve one we have to do that far more difficult thing but opening our hearts
1642.23,1643.43, our fellowship
1643.79,1645.38, those that we thought
1645.5,1647.12, this of god
1647.39,1649.91, when james and john
1650.0,1656.54, to call down fire on the americans because of their unbelief and in the garden of gethsemane
1656.84,1660.02, as the cycles prime to prevent his arrest
1660.29,1666.08, those who tried to show their allegiance to him to violent means
1666.35,1668.06, instead he insisted
1668.12,1673.82, father in heaven causes the sun to shine in both the wicked and the righteous
1674.81,1677.12, to estelle
1677.36,1680.33, good for those who persecute us
1681.44,1683.42, because in the end
1683.6,1686.51, ultimate measure of my love for one
1687.32,1688.49, my love
1688.79,1689.75, no
1690.44,1770.96, he 
1772.1,1778.76, in the gospel of mark for the week the surpassing
