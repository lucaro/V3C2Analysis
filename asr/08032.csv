0.12,5.37, naething
6.27,9.15, thank you
9.3,32.73, learn so much already this last couple of days said papa already some of the things that i'm learning are offering me a little bit of clarity for example more unrested told us that there are actually two voices in our brains that are helping us to make decisions in this case i have me on the stage standerton then i have thee that decided that this line would be a good way to start afforestation
32.79,34.86, big data
34.95,42.78, i think that i am probably seen presentations already about big dat big data and business big date in science
42.81,55.68, and pelver whatever those things are but i think one of the things that we haven't heard very much about is what is the subjective experience like living in this world of big data what is it like to be 
55.8,58.83, living in this ever more complicated world
59.16,80.73, i do a lot of traveling and so maybe this is an example with some bias but i think if we imagine the experience of being in an airport we might start to understand this data experience first of all because there are a lot of systems that are transparent to us that are happening around us are baggages moving on character security agents who are hurting us to line up and so on and so on and so on
80.85,103.26, of all there's a loss of control there i think it's one of the only places that we voluntarily give up control in our lives in an air port were put into line ups were kind of directed were put on to these plans in these kind of data packets that are then sorted into another airport and offloaded and so on and so on and so on may be more importantly though is this idea that were part of a system that we can't possibly imagine the magnitude of
103.77,107.31, as we speak there are more than a million people in the air
107.76,115.53, that you see behind us is this respiring system of airplanes landing and taking off at minute intervals
115.65,129.81, of airplanes in the air right now so i really think that this idea of being caught in a system which is very complicated and too complicated for us to understand really murtherin big data
130.32,140.04, the american disdain foster wallace was very present about this he was asked by his editor when he was riding him finest of but why he put so many foot notes in the book
140.13,156.69, not in that dear really incredible and they sometimes do not have foot notes and occasionally those footnotes have foot notes as well and he said that one of the things he wanted to do was to limit the information flood and dearest he expected to be an even bigger part of life fifteen years hence
156.87,159.66, antinous was written sixteen years ago
160.89,236.82, really excited about this idea they data since i had a conversation about three years ago with this man last lover we were working on a project for wired magazine in the k where i was the editor of a somewhat unfortunately named section called into corn and i worked i worked i worked with doctor barbaric art help show some of the results were a project that he was working one about human mobility and we had the really good luck of working with this date which is one of the largest davises of cell phone usage from unnamed european country the country has the name i bestowed to tell you what it is and so the first thing we saw is not a very exciting grasses people and as the gatehouse and the people on the right are not really kallokagathia were calling
237.21,245.31, maybe more interestingly is the thing that happened on the other side of the page which for which i built these little cubes which i call bambilio maps
245.73,250.95, what we're seeing here is where a cube that shows the single persons travel over about four days
251.1,255.51, so is clearly a commuter they travel back and forth from one location to another
255.57,281.58, but in that day i said we are able to produce these mobility maps for everybody in that dayset tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people and see how their lives can be represented in this release simple form and one of the things that surprised me and that surprised the barbarous that there was a lot of productiveness in the state and so i started getting this idea that we could look at the attainments
281.64,301.77, that i worked on carry through that idea this is a project called just landed have many of your winter probably most people are in twitter and so you've read those trees right there somebody says i just landed and hawaii were stuck on the runway for a second minutes this is really your tainted
302.07,350.43, the rich white people tragedy but right like so i thought i thought it would be really interesting to take those kind of really self serving things this kind of thinly veiled show off and put them together into a map made we can recreate a human ability system by seeing how people are showing off about their travel around the world maybe a little a little less meanly i also put together this project colleged morning which looks at everybody saying good morning to each other on twitter so here's everybody in the world is more than three years ago all saying good morning the green people are getting up early and saying good morning the orange people a little bit later in the red people really lay when we look at the united states he really see the rat on the west coast and the green and the green on the east coast
351.54,411.72, these ideas have been carrying these ideas throughout my work ever since then at the time we built this project working together with a statistician the marchants of the really talented team at the red group of the times we've built this project called cascade and what cascades as it looks at conversations about times content on twitter and were able to recreate every single conversation that happened about every piece of times content in real time so we're locking at a story which is a couple of years old here but it's an interesting one for a couple of reasons but it explain what we're seeing on the left hand side is the very birth of this conversation and the now we're botheration mnestheus searcher of discussion we see something that we've never seen before so exciting this was one of my favorite projects to work on it but like an archaeologist exposing things for the first time that we've never seen before but
411.87,429.69, something always sat really uneasily with me about this project and with the other work that i should and that is that largely this work depends on opportunism were dependent on taking people's day without telling them about it and even though to enter is overtly public that i don't think makes me feel a lot better
429.87,437.16, penteconters a couple of years ago and somebody said this for the first time i think the first time that i heard a dais the new oil
437.7,439.41, clapped
439.8,449.01, excited about david being near think they were thinking about this right where i was in was thinking about this
449.01,450.99, in the context of this
451.44,454.38, we didn't do very well with oil
454.44,458.76, and to suggest the data can be the new i i find frankly terrified
459.3,504.6, maybe there is a piece of this analogy that works for us because oil is composed of all these tiny micro regiments in the historic might be historic microorganisms that had been compressed into this sort of valuable resource data consists of fragments of our lives the valuable data that we're talking about consists fragments of our lives that are being compressed into this valuable resource now i don't really trust maybe it's the canadian and mbiam not sure that i trust corporations to take charge of this type of reasonable last month had some really interesting things to say about it and i've to see wanted
504.6,551.49, to come to a social consensus because the data is valuable and it's owned by all of us collectively so how do we come to a social consensus to make sure that that day can be used for good and not necessarily only for profit well three things i think downers we have to get people used to the idea of owning their own data it is your day you should on that day and that's not the way it works righteousness with resources if the if you wish that important there with with researchers so you can share the if you'd like to please download the upstart recording your location data it's really fun to explore and then share that data if you wish
551.82,565.8, the second thing that we need to really be talking about his data and ethics because i think ethics have been very almost all lacking from this conversation and it's really important that as consumers of data services we start to make decisions based on ethics
566.4,570.45, then finally let's get back to the first thing that i talked about which is this
570.48,579.09, subjective experience of living in a day a world i really really really convinced that the only way we can reach this consensus that we're talking about is by
579.57,587.67, sharing with people and exposing to people what is happening in this day the world and that's i think where the role of data are comes in
587.73,595.65, here today because that excited about data but also because i'm terrified i'm terrified that we are having progress without culture
595.71,624.15, in the world of data and as we've seen with these field industries before the progress was out culture does not work and there's a lot of powerful people in this room and if i can leave you with one thing let's try to bring culture into our discussion with data and let's try to me not make the same mistakes with the new resource that we have with the last one thank you
