28.32,38.31, why do your family pretty and see family went to japan first in nineteen forty seven they were missionaries
38.73,46.29, and i was a baby then and so i basically grew up in japan they stayed for years
46.83,52.62, and i lived in japan and told about years and
52.65,55.38, art going to sea
55.53,56.67, the seventh grade
57.27,62.73, and where were you before seven we before that we lived in 
64.53,68.01, i now called kit
68.22,75.03, and my father was first work in japan was teaching it so
76.29,78.12, in 
78.42,83.64, we were there for three years and then in nineteen fifty we moved to osaka
84.27,87.63, all the rest of my time in japan and 
87.75,90.27, i 
91.08,112.05, and they just want know like so you tended from seventh grade if he can mention that you are also a graduate of sea yestate ideas the seventh grade than in took the eighth grade in the united states we spent a year in the state then and in nineteen eleven twelve i was at sea and graduated in nineteen sixty three
112.56,127.53, okay so i want to ask you what if you have to pig one most memorable experience at sewatis is a difficult question because there were many let's say one of the most memorable experiences
127.8,135.93, in giving an academic example in was one of the main subjects of canadian academy when i was there
136.11,147.48, i like that in all times and a pretty good student and i remember once we had a final exam when i was a junior
147.99,159.18, and the teacher of the class was hungry allen and he was had been a come in in the middle of the air because
159.27,164.97, regular teacher had had an accident of some kind he broke his leg and was out
165.21,168.21, plantain to take over
168.57,171.66, and he was a british
171.75,175.14, mary in the missions to seamen and cover
175.74,177.21, and he really
177.27,180.99, sharp individual and he knew latin certainly very well
181.35,189.21, we were translating in those more gravity than we were translating seesawing like that and the class
189.39,192.93, we did this final exam and i thought you know i've done a perfectly
193.11,194.19, and
194.34,196.62, put in 
196.8,206.28, no other remarks on the page and you know i must smoke here i think we had ninety five whether why is it a hundred so i go visit him
206.85,209.7, and i promised 
209.94,226.95, how can make us better in ninety five i know what any mistakes here you know i want no what a toff i could improve something and he said a baconian he sort of put his hands across his system it like this and he says mistiness
227.28,234.36, make it better as my messenian forgotten that moment
234.63,236.34, it was
236.58,284.22, smoke kid you know i think you henery thing again and he kind of put me in my place and i i never have forgotten that moment way i deeply appreciate it to attention as that kind of lesson the question but may be i can think of a different moment like to some event or the fact that she has had on you and like the greater length of reality be a time in japan you time and see a well you know you to effects in jerooslem of course is a very rigorous school and as a result i came to the state to go to college and really had no trouble with academics and all in fact had many cases as i felt in advance of other students even as an eighteen year old
284.28,314.64, freshmen are years of more in college so it's one area the other areas celestial and that may be more important because we were a canadian academy it was like an island surrounded by land in a nanja with all these for students aruacans students there as well but all the passes were done either in english or the french classes were done in french and of course the japanese classes were taught in japanese but
314.79,316.86, we got to know each other very well
317.16,319.95, still to this day my
320.31,322.08, the friends
322.14,323.28, the planet
323.34,325.17, people i met at
325.17,327.09, i still have contact with them
327.27,345.54, we got together every now and then you know here in york city we have an annual reading in dinner and these are the friends i count as you know connington of thing and i went to college in the states and i still have some contact with my college my class mates in the 
346.5,348.54, closer relationships
348.72,351.87, cause of what we have in common in japan
351.9,358.14, relationships that we forced the canadian academy and that's out forgivable you know that's going to last a lifetime
359.1,385.83, the same with me though sure i only outcast because you know yesterday be expanding at a little bit of a more like wood has oriental a moment or a memory that of going up in japan 
385.89,400.74, you know we were in japan shortly after the second world war and one would have expected if you look in other countries where there had been more than eruption of some kind one would have expected that there would be a great deal of resentment
400.95,415.47, the people who are occupying the country and the allied forces led many by the us were occupying japan from the end of the war up until about early somewhere i think was the final date of this collocation
416.07,419.16, and but we never experienced that
419.37,430.95, i'm sure there were a few japanese who resented all these you know big guinea marking around and with especially the military guys with a certain swagger with which they would walk and so on
431.16,435.18, he almost never saw any evidence of that
435.51,438.81, the japanese were
438.87,451.23, just realized that that was over the war was over and this is a new phase and now they accepted accepted us and you know i actually lived at the candidate's including we lived in as
451.59,456.21, not many foreigners and also in those days and the early 
456.36,472.38, our family made friends we felt accepted with the we were never in any danger of thinking we were like japanese that would never happen but it was like living in a safe life
472.59,482.16, could be on the streets late at night as a little kid and nobody's going to touch you or attack you and i mean japan then and even now safer than
482.28,484.32, most big cities in the world
484.71,486.84, people walking the streets alone 
487.35,502.68, for example so that something that one would not forget and you know in lime all my life to one is this so in the clementine at sea may be a classmate of maybe some of the teachers like some one that like
502.74,523.47, who is really inspired your relume the sapientes community shortening in teachers
523.62,528.81, if i'm going to single out one that really inspired me was gilbert cones
529.26,535.05, and he was a japanese american who really had spent most of his life growing up in new york city here
535.26,539.07, and he had gotten a degree i think from the new school for social research
539.55,544.53, a village and he ended up in japan i was kind of trying to find his own roots
544.98,547.77, he taught the class called speech
548.22,556.29, and it was less a speech class we had to do that kind of thing too but it was less a speech class and it was how to think class
556.65,563.04, and i mean he would ask sometimes he'd say you know take out a piece of paper and just start writing
563.22,574.29, sort of thing and you'd have to come home with something which may you think and the other times we would read as an sidhe would ask very pointed questions you know mister lesbia is the meaning of this
574.44,575.76, the safety
575.88,581.28, that kind of thing and you'd have to it wasn't something you can memorize you had to be thinking in order to come up with it
581.55,585.06, the kinds of questions he asked me
585.36,590.76, i found that when i was a college student and later on became a university professor
591.57,600.81, asking the same kinds of questions that godliness asking us and i began to realize the depth of the influence that that gentleman had
600.99,604.11, my learning and on my life
604.44,605.73, forgotten
605.82,609.15, okay and yet
612.99,615.6, sound men to dine
615.69,627.18, it is not such obeisances camera apolinario on catocalae sipiagin
628.53,635.31, an i think i already commonness is is there any other thing you like to say about
635.37,638.67, the time as had like a bigger
638.67,649.65, but i think i assessor you want to tell her oronesti about the experience there that were positive
649.65,653.07, and you know there's one example
653.1,657.78, people there from all different backgrounds amities religions
657.84,665.22, i lowish people there christian in my case that were muslims there was behind
665.28,673.71, there were japanese who you know presumably would be boisterous their practice and yet we didn't
673.71,680.46, care much about that or we didn't really explore that and students with each other we just like each other because we like each other
680.55,681.66, were people
681.87,690.33, and i found out a really positive thing too so you'll be really difficult to get out of canadian academy and be a racist
690.78,691.68, because
692.13,695.64, everybody and we like to everybody we go along with everybody
695.76,701.52, obviously somebody would have for can be a little stranger something but
701.79,705.36, that's something i really value you know we're all human beings
705.54,712.23, probably the teacher that we had that my best exemplified that was george samuel
712.68,714.66, was from south india
715.2,722.25, and he came to japan to teach him when he was just in his and he stayed there whole career
722.34,726.54, if there you know after he'd been there for a year
726.72,741.96, as his family there george sand was one of the most magnetic is still today liberty california when a most magnanimous individuals anybody will ever meet and you know he's an expanded thing you'd be taken a test and one of his classes
742.23,744.06, he'd be walking around
744.12,745.68, he looked at your paper
745.86,757.53, be shuttling at you know and then he see something and he might give you a hand he just wandered the students to succeed said he look over your pallor shoulder yet say something i think i
758.07,759.0, that
759.15,764.04, you are not to go back and look at this one you get the answer
764.04,768.87, but you know you need something was wrong there and you needed to improve it in some way
769.08,772.98, that's the kind of thing that you just
773.4,788.43, positive it a human it's like a canadian cademy was a place like you felt you could be long you could you know you could be part of the fabric of a family there something like that and that's pretty gable when you're just a number of 
788.58,793.29, a small number of gudgeon foreigners in this huge country
793.5,800.58, you know panicale almost say utterance of japanese
802.53,812.34, and the united states for example are canada very different with huge diversity of ethnic ties and religions and so on and so
812.58,824.25, that kind of experience that you haven't a comedy was just able andsome of my friends whom i still kept in contact with all these years it's only in later years after you're out of canadian for
825.12,828.87, years he starts talking all the facts
828.9,846.51, jewish all right i don't you get to japan and you found many of them were trying to escape to some kind of a you know discrimination in their own country and in europe for some place in the middle east and they ended up in a place like india or in china and then somehow that to japan
846.87,855.39, and it also gives another overlay of interest to all of those human relationships you had earlier now you can expand them it made them
855.6,856.38, deeper
857.52,877.56, the question about the man like fortyeight be one of them this point people who want to do like the scientist went obliterating his anger impressions of the location and hootsenoo done in rowland
877.71,886.05, and i think that's nowhere over twenty years ago i moved that
886.05,892.41, then upon the hill was marvelous you could actually see out of your school and to
892.62,895.68, you could see the whole city of corioli
896.07,897.42, and
897.54,902.79, you know civitella just a little tiny fishing village in the middle of the tenth century
903.51,910.98, and once to pan gaped up you know the official opening day was january first
912.63,914.34, major restoration
914.55,920.04, once that happened a lot of foreigners from europe and north america started going to japan for
920.19,929.04, for business purposes trade import export some one and there were two centers where they lived and worked on as yokohama and one was cold
929.43,932.64, and so it has a kind of stamp on a 
932.64,936.42, a foreign inspired city in a way
936.51,939.03, and i saw an exhibition
939.09,945.63, last year at the philadelphia museum art fallowing on the world something like that
945.69,953.4, there were some photographs or some actually maybe drawing it back in middle century of how cool they looked and there were
953.43,963.0, images from up on my sad or local patience no buildings just trees and a couple of small fishing boats out of the port
963.0,964.74, so in a mirror
964.86,966.63, called a century and a half
966.96,970.68, went from a little fishing village to a major metropolis
970.74,986.79, not only in japan but in the world and one of the reasons is not just because the japanese began to move in there because the europeans north americans moved there to do trade important export and so that makes cabecilla a tick
986.88,991.98, a third culture kid obese is not truly japanese
992.01,996.03, the purely western it's kind of felix
996.15,999.96, and i guess that becomes an unforgettable experience all
1000.23,1005.57, and finally is not the highest question we all tend to get it from evybody
1005.75,1016.82, you can describe sea and one word or one prayer your experience there won't work one phrase for canada to carmachel i would say 
1017.72,1020.93, i would say something like
1024.95,1026.12, for
1026.15,1029.18, when i say forget i must in a positive sense
1029.63,1036.38, she is positively unforgetable as that great that good 
1037.31,1044.03, good let's cut it cut both audience
1044.27,1055.7, i nicotine in the old athinking about canada comes that you know when you're a student there you have a good time and everything but you take a lot of things for granted
1056.66,1064.61, and as i've gotten over and away from canada economy and continue to interact with some of my classmates and the many other people
1064.67,1069.71, graduated even you know for years after i did
1069.83,1072.8, find that it's more important for you
1073.4,1076.91, begin to reflect and almost in an existential way
1077.18,1081.38, meaningful to maecenas to our own existence
1081.83,1085.19, i think that's something that only time
1085.55,1090.5, only time can tell that kind of thing because you don't notice the your year old kid
1091.25,1094.34, probably indeed to get out of there and who on with your life
1094.55,1097.28, but looking back on you could really
1097.28,1100.43, appreciate the value of the experience that he had 
1101.99,1106.16, thank you i got that last
