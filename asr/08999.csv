2.07,11.61, joining the poorga charley i'll be receiving our new year before that happens andovers things that'll help you perform better out on the water and go over on boxing your product
11.79,21.99, do that what's over some tools they don't need to get into your box with tennyson in sharp i like to use a set of keys just rip to the tape a box cut a roll also do
22.5,43.14, need a screw driver we recommend a number three screw driver put your bindings on your board not a number two screwdriver a number three screwdriver head is bigger and i grabs the head the head of the screw better a number two screw driver can strip a mouth and it doesn't allow you to get the binding screws as tight as a number three servers to make sure sauber three screwdriver
43.2,44.88, and take measure
44.88,48.63, to measure your old stands with and then transfer that to your
48.63,50.94, your new boots on your board
51.63,64.44, before i go over on boxing her product i want to talk about standing for a second i want to show you a simple way to find a good starting standing and this can help you perform better out on the water and also help prevent injury
64.47,88.68, you can do is stand with your feet right underneath your shoulders move each foot about an inch outward and then you want to do a full squat as you squad lean your weight a little bit of your heels and let your feet is kindelon and as you get to the bottom of your squad your feet should kind a turn out your knees and your legs should force your feet outward and they should go they should just fall into a good standing
88.83,94.62, stand up one more time and then do one more full squan you'll see that your niece track better with your feet
94.77,97.26, a great starting stance angle
97.29,108.6, this is important is because if you have bowlegs where your knees and of your legs kind of boat outward or if you're not in it and your knees kind of you a boat inward
108.69,124.47, if you have the wrong stance angle in respect to your leg type you can enter self a lot more easily so if you're bow legged your general going to have a straight forward essendean standing so duck stance is when
125.04,129.18, toes are angled outward like this
129.21,136.86, and like a duck stands on the ground so a good starting stance angle for most people is about twelve degrees doubt outward
136.92,155.73, so if you're bow leg and generally you're going to be a little less dust or you can be you'll want to do that test that told you about to find out where your niece track and where your nest are your feet falling to position but sometimes if someone's really bow legged they'll have a little bit straight or of the stance than someone who's not
155.76,161.7, someone's knock need they can have a little bit more doctor the stance because there needs kind of fall inward
161.76,217.35, you have the opposite stand than your leg type that's how you can injure yourself to make sure you do that test figure out where your feet kind of fall into place put that on your board go out and ride it feels comfortable that's great if not just a just accordingly you might also want to stand in the mirror and look at your legs and see if you have generally straight legs or if you're bowlegged or knocked and then a gusterson next don't want to talk about how to find an easy way to find your stance with so for this we're going to grab our tadasu and before you dissemble your board to put your new bindings on your board will i want to show you a way to measure to find the stanchest with rather so gravitate measure the way that i like to tell people to to figure out their stance with is you measure from the center bolts and then you add one side play with
217.41,221.91, and with a measured from the very center of each finding
222.0,234.99, so if you take just one side play with an added to the center screws then that's basically like taking half of this plate with and half of this play with to each center and in adding that to the withan between
235.14,241.02, i'll do it i'll take my tip measure and i'll measure from cresco
241.14,254.61, on this forgive me and then if i add the plate with and i know these places are six on plates all human would bindings are six inch with so if you slip a binding over and measure or cross the bombola
254.7,274.32, you'll see that from scarecrow is six inches with the exception of our size twelve thirteen that's a bigger binding so we had to accommodate a bigger foot and that force is to have a seven inch plate so all the all the mining plates are six inches and then when you get to a twelve thirteen plus size
274.38,279.0, seven inch plate so you want to add even for that size
279.18,290.1, in this instance i have ten inches in the middle from scrutore i add six because i'm adding half of this one in half of this one or one side play with
290.19,296.49, i guess me inches so i know my stance with from senor binding to center of mining is inches
296.7,313.62, when i take my bindings off put him on a new board i can find that with by starting on the outside holes to have a blank board over here
313.65,332.04, i measure with my treasure and i go to the outside hole to the outside wall i know on this one the widest stands with his thirty two if i subtract six from that i'm goin to get twenty six i know i need the move in until i find twenty four if i want to have the stand the same stance with as on my other board
332.07,334.77, a great way to figure out your stance with
335.28,346.17, go over unboxing your product so you want an rebates or your box cutter to cut on the tape on the box on the handle side there should be take on all three sides
346.35,362.58, describe a case and continent and the leg had come up open and just like a normal snow were box or even a shoe box i slipped that open the sound your product paganism and side
362.88,378.51, he also found a bag of mounting brackets and also m six crews these are for mounting our food to your board unremoved the bags
378.54,400.77, passes aside and then on the side of each pair of boots you'll find a little hamlet you might want to go through this and get familiar with all the features of the boots and then also don't forget to visit or website to give familiar with any martinton that might be helpful to you all right so let's go ahead and set up your boots on your board
401.16,408.36, so take the howl goods and put them on this this way or
408.6,418.68, we're going to take the stand from our old board and we're going to try to find it on our new board soon take my tip measure you'll find twenty four inches
420.39,428.55, so here we have found the interstate are inches apart on a minus six and as going my twenty four somethin place
428.97,434.76, nineteen those inserts in my gray binding hardware
435.33,439.89, the one screw now when your mounting your your bothered
439.98,446.79, i recommend that you only thread a couple threads on this one side don't tighten the side all the way down first
446.79,450.84, because that's what causes the cross treading on the other side sometimes
450.9,483.36, so that's one big mistake that writers make it is they'll tighten the side all the way down and then when they try to thread this one it puts the binding on conward angle and forces the screw in a word angle and it could cross thread the screw and then it's really hard to get that off and rethreaded properly so just go ahead and take your number three screw driver remember us a number three screw driver and not a number two go ahead and read this one and just a few threads and justly let itself let the screw guide itself in don't force it in
489.15,509.16, i got that nice and loose so i can still move them the boot and lined up with my stance angle on the other side going grade your other mounting bracket and screw and then this turn this one a few threads let it guide itself in
509.58,519.96, he went out at side about three turns in then you can tie them all the way down together and you know that they're not crossed thread
519.99,543.03, so go ahead and crank those downstairs you can all right not each mounting bracket has a plastic washer on the top o this plastic water is there to act like a lock walter so your screws don't loosen up on you when you're riding the first time that you montanari ing these are going to compress a little bit
543.06,558.48, they could listen up on you so you might want to check on you know maybe in the middle of your first ride and definitely at the end of your first ride and then before each ride just to make sure that your scrutinous compression of everything since it's no the case plate
558.6,571.02, the not on washer even the board is going to press a little bit so you're screws may loosen up and you want to check them with your number three screw drivers to make sure you keep one in the boat at all times at work keeping in your car if you go to the cable
571.11,595.65, and just make sure you check your buying straws before a dried that's kind of a safety recommendation so once you get these crackdown go ahead and set up your boot on the other side the exact same way and you're all set to go a you're all set up again thanks for joining the splurge you have any questions feel free to contact a directly in statue for more content coming your way
