34.05,84.81, he
93.93,98.97, perhaps is the most desolate wild and abandoned country in all england
99.99,101.43, mountains of the peak
101.61,104.79, seem to be about the beginning of wonders to this part of the country
104.82,107.49, but the beginning of mountains or if you will
107.58,109.32, the lower rounds of a ladder
110.34,114.99, from this ridge of mountains that all the rivers in the north of england take their rise
115.59,117.36, so this whole country
117.54,118.86, mountains
119.28,122.43, no sooner were we down one hill but we mounted another
122.82,124.92, infinitely full of people
125.61,127.62, people all full of business
128.49,130.5, business is the clothing trade
131.01,137.94, convenience of which the houses of the scattered and spread upon the sides of the hills as above even from the bottom to the top
138.36,139.59, reason is this
139.83,143.52, such has been the bounty of nature to this otherwise frightful country
143.7,148.44, two things essential to the business as well as to the ease of the people are found here
149.22,161.19, that in a situation which i never saw the like of in any part of england and i believe the like is not to be seen so contrived in any part of the world i mean coals and running water upon the tops of the highest hills
162.06,167.55, seems to have been directed by the wise hand of providence for the very purpose which is now served by it
169.08,177.3, manufactures
185.7,190.8, of the sleep from the gloom of motion soundlessly some member
191.16,198.78, and booms the soul of a people imprisoned asleep in the rule of the strong machine that runs mesmeric
199.05,202.05, the spines were upon the
202.05,204.78, moving them helpless mechanic
204.99,208.32, there will i will defer
208.95,224.85, space is not a smooth or striated
225.0,280.71, a thinking about smooth space is like a child playing in a field but all its fantasies or present at once as no limit on his thinking no limit to what it can do and gradually it learns the rules of how to behave and that field started to become peopled with rules and fences and boundaries that constraint so it can't run free any more alone flight is something that breaks out of the stations of that face and those striations but psychologically physically and socially or what binders into modifications connection it can be a psychological fantasy
280.98,293.07, come a practice at something which helps you to break free and challenges those those are also moves between the fences to get you out
293.22,308.19, in the exception of taking evaporating in a barefooted and without your baggage a purist for climbing the reader if you also lying things it 
308.34,313.8, so absolutely commitment greatness on a great is risk and many many the greatest we want
314.1,321.87, the sewing is in fact of the fantasia of the tenses in the sense of the everything you think you get from it is
322.08,326.34, but it's also saint if you do for you body
330.69,335.4, at social industries command how quick how vast an increase
335.85,343.95, the germ of some poor hamlet rapidly produced here a huge town continuous and compact hiding the face of earth for leagues
344.13,345.09, there
345.18,347.28, no habitation stood before
347.76,351.78, bones of men regularly masked like trees in forests
352.08,358.08, spread through spacious tracks or which the smoke of unremitting fires hangs permanent
358.35,362.16, plentiful as reeves evaporating in the morning sun
362.85,367.62, the traveler turned his steps he sees the baron wilderness raised
368.01,369.45, disappearing
369.69,377.43, the 
377.73,379.83, the worst of it
380.58,382.35, the big place
382.59,383.88, i
386.34,394.2, to dangerous presswork and because we women out lumps lad round allowed he got chagrin upon cannon with her
394.65,399.21, that gayelette in her another
399.69,402.09, eventually got you to
402.27,406.11, just think veniniferous got you to what you would do in other
406.2,412.41, it
412.89,434.73, eastward a colonna sixteen just on the east of the pennines where the deep coal mines are lining stared on the west of the penitent moved eastwards as technology creased and allowed people to accessories of coradine realized that the rolleston edges and places decline 
435.45,440.55, so it was a real tree discovering all this less than an hour from where i was brought up
440.73,469.71, and i guess being a minor spending all the time in the dark was a real release relator come out to these places so the climbing was fantastic were real so that just a light and being in the outdoors and the beetles and the repetition of the works in toleration and so climbing really fulfilled a long
470.64,496.44, i mean what interesting in impassable at san a coal mining town placation get really strong correlation between place and occupation so for example you know people live in a place communing happen there and so that a big overlight you don't really get that we medallists no houses there that a shopping center thereanentis there
499.53,503.43, he
507.0,514.32, within in complicating on it and what want it brought into existence can be identified and commodities
514.41,515.49, some way
520.29,535.05, and yet he can get it fireflies of flight you get in the busy world version of fantasy well in the same engrossing you recall in a tarentines not outside
535.05,556.83, it is from an inferiority and from an intensiveness and i think that's why people keep going to extremes and keep moving and looking for a for extreme experiences is that because they won the intensity the home predictability the discovery of a direction that they didn't know before they set off
558.12,570.24, it's very hard to think of individual experiences because orso many and had so many of them were the same and the best experiences are often just the
570.84,574.86, endless procession days out the same places
576.39,585.93, the same things and that below highlights in arbors just being out on the almost constant basis
586.5,592.35, sometimes it's just to release in the escape and none of the adventure and then sometimes it's plenty aventure
593.67,602.07, his hard or things go it differently to how you plan said the lacertine
602.16,606.9, and away for you can have eventually really close to him
610.65,619.59, after that a living very easy if you know relative terms in it very comfortable and
619.71,621.21, placable
621.78,631.56, and it is a fantastic feeling almost an ascetic feeling to be in cragthorpe is has got a wonderful
631.59,632.85, see to it
633.36,639.18, look down from high up but it will save
639.54,646.56, the great stone and craskell it's just you know bat retain it's often things done time and time again
647.13,661.65, really resist the idea that it's true because which is what often people think combination i hate that but i think that because it sounds carolinians in shallow but may be i am and it is just about gangrel
662.16,680.52, so i think somehow it it's way connects to the rest of my life that gives it the gift in places then the meaning that they have i guess that retention or friends old roots or moves familiarity
680.94,688.32, it's almost like a richer sometimes i think
694.5,708.99, robert when he climbing were now expectation i said so misleading and they certainly not bad tentation all is disengaged for a little while
709.92,712.98, after the abenalfange
723.54,751.92, teetotalers ototototoi
752.61,755.28, rolling the looms when everything was
755.28,760.95, in one you can alter swept away by the herald
761.1,774.93, sometimes i can do all things to your head where you just have to stop and go outside all the time i can
775.08,778.59, in respect place is where is sort of
779.7,787.38, on panoria's happening in constantine on ingathering at nothing going on but the rest of the
787.38,792.0, abednego upon flight to
792.06,801.72, ingelow again that's a good aspect for the work that you mind is free to
802.11,804.84, well go where it needs to 
805.14,816.9, i teetotalers
821.31,824.34, but all the protestant for
824.58,827.55, waterlilies
828.18,831.48, the chief man and it was an artifice
831.6,833.43, less than full rebound
833.61,835.05, admit
835.65,838.5, i stop
840.51,842.97, here the reason i started
843.21,844.65, mother
844.83,848.61, that you want haverton the other and was his tone
848.7,851.76, sintenis cosimonino
851.94,853.74, what it did for me
854.7,856.71, when our time
857.13,858.78, everything else is 
859.23,863.01, walter was doing a work of manitou
863.52,865.83, elseways
866.19,875.91, i see coatapantli ones go on these wings in this what climate you make a mistake when
876.57,878.94, he is called the rustic
879.87,882.45, i often be dried up to the idol
884.25,886.8, unable by any one
886.83,888.45, poor
888.66,891.87, but the sense of a resting contradict
892.11,894.72, everything untangling
895.56,898.83, the anastasi
900.15,902.79, you know people finucane
914.1,918.66, i caught this morning morning's minion
918.66,926.73, kingdom of daylight of dappled dawn drawn falcon in his riding of the rolling level underneath him steady air
927.12,929.28, and striding high there
929.31,933.36, how he ran upon the reign of a wimpling wing in his ecstasy
933.66,954.21, off off for on swing as escaped heel sweeps smooth on a bow bend the her and gliding rebuffed the big wind my heart in hiding stirred for a bird be achieved at the master of the thing
982.05,991.29, i 
991.56,1003.11, isabelle not interested the wages of work is cash
1003.62,1006.47, ages of cash is one more cash
1006.83,1010.04, we of more cash is vicious competition
1010.7,1013.28, wages of vicious competition is
1013.73,1015.2, world we live in
1016.67,1038.06, one of the problems with myriads and teaching but i do work outside of teaching and then you get a conflict between those two humans because they both require more time and you've got is trying to achieve went
1038.33,1048.41, if you were sort of nowaday wouldn't aberyswith complete on approach to work in if you want something to some do a job well
1048.47,1050.27, give them the time to do it
1050.42,1061.1, unfortunate that seemed to be luxurious and expensive and so the precious comfort father you've got if you are some one who has a pride in what they do
1061.16,1068.45, i want to be really well at it which i have then the pressures often from the father i feel and not able to do a good job
1068.57,1071.33, things on the mastodon
1072.56,1076.7, little that we now work in a changed
1076.91,1095.93, i think the character of work hasn't changed all that much at all work hard essentially in tasteful of time and were all now when the pressure in terms of the ore job ten hours we were where there were over or under employed with forth to working conditions that 
1095.93,1108.62, don't help us to remain connected to the rest of life i think the continuity for me is it
1108.8,1118.13, it wanted some sort of release from that we all feel like that more or less and and the way out of that philotadpole myself included
1118.19,1124.58, kind of immediate that with what i think is very kind of superficial form of freedom
1124.58,1133.94, we buy things nothing because there's not a great deal of ourselves in there there's not a bit not intenseness
1134.06,1136.34, it's convenient and its quick
1136.43,1142.58, i think what i'm interested in and fame what climbing does is it produced i think
1143.0,1170.42, so more intense feeling of escape or satisfaction
1173.18,1183.44, come
1193.94,1195.02, he
1196.94,1197.93, he
1198.26,1210.08, i 
1210.2,1214.1, he
1220.34,1229.7, but
1240.26,1246.05, it must be a feeling of endless bliss to be in contact with the profound life of every form
1246.32,1250.16, have a soul for rocks metal water and plants
1251.18,1254.0, take into himself as in a dream
1254.06,1255.83, every element of nature
1256.55,1260.33, flowers that breathed with the waxing and waning of the moon
1269.9,1341.63, he
