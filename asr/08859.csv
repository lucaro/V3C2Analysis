126.06,145.8, little women is an amazing treasure the music in the show is second to no it's really amazing amazing lyric amazing score the orchestration is fabulous that in itself
146.04,248.52, the story is one that i think everybody can relate to and that it's a story about wanting to be something in the world and wanting to you overestimate realizing that what really makes you astonishing is that you do what god has made you and how you are insinuating girl who is just so chockful of passion and she just has so much inside of her that she is just not going to stop until she shares with the world her stories and the relationship that she has with her sisters and with her mother and with her friends just inspire her so much to write these amazing amazing books and it is just a beautiful beautiful musical i have never had anything like it i know that people elsewhere were doing little women that she was talking with the director about any special effects that were needed since we had done so much with fog and the prior years and she said no we don't need any fog but i do need you to go flyin i'm sure he stated a long time to be delivered that long but still and looking at flying a kite and doors it was no little feet and so when i reached it i looked shattering with it i was finding
248.91,276.27, very little of very few production were able to actually incorporate the kite in fact some professional production didn't do it at all and so we set about that you know and anabaptists
276.81,327.81, make it the best possible experience for our students and our audience that would possibly can the story line itself is a very real story and i again telecaster on stage it's fantastic show a little one and wouldn't exist without the man in the show there sabathier
328.41,340.29, when i heard the play was going to be little woman i can i didn't really know what to expect because i know it was a famous book but i didn't really know the story line
340.59,347.31, and the title little women i didn't really think there'd be much opportunities for good rules
347.52,414.57, i heard the music from the play and and the story line i i really like it to notice is fantastic to the characters and the player are just really brilliance little innis a story about a family during the savior and it's just a good story that teaches a lot of valuable lessons about forgive me alive and family and to friends and it just has a really a lot of christian overtones and god lessening it i play the role of joe march and she is a very determined different type of girl for her rash really is has a lot of dreams and gold that are out of the ordinary for that time in she's very stubborn she knows what she wants and she does that she's going to get it and so tis a very determined different but person a good professor burt whose german professor who used to live in germany and he moved to new york
414.87,487.59, and he's really enjoying his this kind of normal life is not very exciting he does the same thing every day but then he staying at a boarding house and one day jo march comes to the boarding house and she completely changes his life he doesn't really realize it but he starts to fall in love with her a missus carr i on the boarding house in new york city where josephine march line she came here a few weeks ago with this dream to be an accomplished writer to be very published a very famous and earn barrels of money and superfast she said and some one else who also lives in my boarding house is professor fritz may he is a professor at university he's from germany and he and miss march have a very peculiar relationship they are always quarrelling no matter the rainers whether it's tuesday or monday but i have to say that there is a bit of something underneath those
487.62,538.26, arguments that i think they need a third party to look in on themselves and i am happy to provide that service i play the part of john brooke and he's pretty interesting character he was callow with meg had comonfort sight actually he sees her and mammalian flustered mood and then he let us set his eyes on her changes his frame of mind says so here so your margaret thus when they really fall in love and he's very interesting character he knows what he wants and life and he's very committed to his goal and he goes for things so he is the civil war is going on and his friends are off in the war finding and he feels the need that he has to go and fight and immediately he goes in and less
538.32,654.15, at the same time he's torn because he has his love that man back home he wants both but he can't have both so he does best to compromise and that's what john brooks character is in little women i play the character of larry to his basically just to find guy attavanti he can do a lot of renaming like play a pickle of sleep standing up hold his breath for really a long time and i can do none of those things i read musicals i play the carter mamma she's the mother of the four march girl she's a very loving character stern one needed but otherwise she loved her girls to death and she couldn't bear to be a part and joselyn story of despair such but totalitarian arbery name is margaret with jontarou's elaine she gets to oliliet attention it was really hard to be a character that was an adult i wouldn't call myself in return but i mean it's hard to imagine you had four kids and try to be that stern parent that when needed means to yell amythaon they're getting a bit rambunctious yes i get a gathered along to anybody not to lemminkainen to offer but she doesn't like her taking
654.51,691.95, my favorite song perhaps is a lathering mare who was the cassiterides with his grandfather and his tutor is really cute why foreseen probably have to be fought for ever and it is just a unsolicited to put on like a man play with in their own home in the the kind of adopt the character of gloria and brother
691.95,753.48, he has often need to do it with them so it's just kind of where the audience sees glories interaction with the sisters and his initial connection with them eradicating and silliness pathetically die nutritious i laurentine there's march gilian of chosen stories it was called the operatic tragedy and for all of massachusetts decided that they were going to go out and put on this grand commotion i wouldn't call it grand it was more of a big musical nomina but doin away on his life of all those girls i mean that started messing with their heads they all wanted to become talented and musical and and all of these things and i really don't think that they shulde
753.72,1018.44, his operatic tragedy with all of these phenomenal characters that the cow had created and they every one in conquered thought that they loved it i i didn't rave about it at all that i don't think they should have put it on all my overall barricades the volcano press and i like it because you see a lot of people working together and it's two different parts of it there's a one hand joe and professor bear having a talk about what happened with the publisher in the background you see ah her story as she is reading it out loud you see them performing in the background i am roi want to geographical and she was very energetic cut dainty governess wealthy tidewater coast there then she starts off knowing these principles very oesterhaninge men and goes through all these trials in little oligarchy i tell you it is so awkward growing up there he is like my family are my family they are a so i am and only had can you imagine living like a normal neighborhood but the sitsumi's and johnny's right and there's some neither is my given me i don't have listened and i just had to go it's really awkward were elementary school i don't marathon me ten years disintegrated she has her now who destiny giving up her lip what's like compeller will elocution is her necklace her shawl as in its like in our blood to kind of move in that fashion i mean a does take some theatricalness to do it because like officially when people like that random little girl that ran to my forenoons ago i sat her call it rinieri i have at home but like so i had a very scary around her right but it does take me training and practice weightier two to four when one i'm going through terrestial colinderies here she can be a woman with that bone can be not vain and chicken give what she has and be innocent of the confessional the new morals and the tetrastyle she ends up getting back in the fighting for what she believes that i am gotthard at first day i immediately got so sidecars thersites bit and notes she has to poniotowsky and you think middle schools rough normally try being the only hideous one with a wart on the end of your nose when you like twelve okay that is rough that is hard but you know what it made me stronger so like help me find who i am like my inner hags willet rowell well so i think i think i turned out okimpare scene is the fire within me just because it's the whole turning point of the musical its enjolras that she can't accomplish her gold in her dreams just by herself she needs to take off and pull from what is within her which is her sisters and desesperee she had with them and she realizes in this scene that that only when she can achieve her dreams as if she she just takes from what her past is in her sister's unbiased say days of plenty just because you really see marmites almost as every other part she has strong powerful person and she breaks down in her own way where she tranitch jooles but it's really difficult knowing she loved she lost that then you know he is to see you break down and it is really funny i think it speaks to people
1018.98,1209.93, but i love botherations all the students together it's it's a bonding agent that happens within the students of our school and in the fine arts department and you know i think i've seen over this period of time that i've been a privilege to be in this position just how that on screens many other parts of our school and other aspects so it's a great time for nothing is that it is an opportunity for students to grow musically spiritually emotionally rationally and being above in the musical allows me to have the opportunity to see all that growth happened soon students come into their own and the foreordaining kids that normally wouldn't be plunged in god to be able to do something like this i think it is as big a deal as seeing the stars and the really gifted ones that you know are gifted and get on stage in and lead from there but to see other kids get involved it wouldn't be involved otherwise streathern too was my mother who was the dreamland on my own so with the combination of hurting me and just the experience that i had as a student is really portmanteau ringleader two students who just go from you know some one was just an i've seen in class or inquire you know they have a really strong addition and so we put them in a role that we think we mesa little bigger for them and then they just lost and then from then on it like lead rolls hands down they want to be musical guermantes i mean happen every single year we deserteur take this opportunity and work in the lightest and that is what makes me so thrilled because that's what happened to me you know when i was in high school with all embody musical those things were life changing experiences and completely character transforming experiences for me the years ago we did musical entertainer harold hill has a whole town imagining what this marching band is going to be lived and as i was watching it i saw this short budgeted with round glasses come striding out into the front pretending that he was playing a trombone and had all the moves down and the totally captured my imagination which is exactly what harold hill would was doing in just a few weeks ago for the trolleymen
1209.99,1221.18, i sandbank in the room and i watched the same young man all grown up young strapping muscular smart handsome walk up to the piano
1221.72,1234.59, and he was asked to sing a song that is sung in little women and by the character junks and it's basically a proposal of marriage to one of the march girls well the pianist started playing
1234.98,1288.38, this young man started singing this beautiful love song and his tenor voice just walked in and echoed throughout the room and i looked in every single girl in that room watching his performance was gone it was just an amazing thing to watch it was the same kind that came running out and captured my imagination all harold hill what he will do in this room during little women i think will be amazing and that's just one of many amazing musical and performing moments that you will experience a little women book a christian funeral a lot to me because it takes kids that normally may not be most active kids and forces untether comfort zones and
1288.95,1294.95, and they get upon stage and they do a great job doing what they love and its need to see people doing that
1295.31,1329.06, it's a lot of fun too i mean i love being upon stage singing and acting is what i like to do and it's fun to be unified doing it well music and drama are both very very important to people in general because everyone has expressed themselves somehow and that all their conway but without music and drama or even poetry all different kinds of ways of expression life would be boring and people wouldn't be able to express themselves in music is a great way
1329.06,1367.04, to bring in rhythm and melody to saying a story or telling you telling a story or telling a lesson and it sometimes he helps people understand or connect with something better and it's just really important in life to express yourself in more ways than one bulgarian fine arts department has really affected me because when i came to the school i honestly didn't know much about music i knew i wanted to sing but it partialist kind of singing popinot i've gone through every sane and missus poole and miss wheresoever one is encouraged to me to become
1367.22,1412.61, confident my abilities and classically i mean who do think i would have ended up now singing opera but i mean it's such a fantastic program and all these opportunities to put on practically a broadway production pleasantness really help me to remember to be myself
1412.7,1460.55, no matter what you need to come to little women if nothing else to see the sword fights and the kite you've got to come just to see the kite being flown in the chapel that amazing you know every year there's always one sometimes two students that just you know skyrocket to high levels of performance but this year is different it's truly stunning to seakale of students all achieving at these high levels of performance now when you combine with a scornful
1460.58,1473.9, what i believe will go down in history as a real bench mark in bachissia fine arts this production is one you want to make sure you got to
1473.96,1696.71, you know we're a small school but we are so blessed and god has just gifted us with so many talented kids it's unbelievable how he is so faithful every year to supply us with the kids that we need and they are just magnificent i have never known a group of students particularly this group to be so dedicated and to work so hard and to want to get everything so right and it has just shown throughout every single rehearsal through every line every movement every block they have just they had just set an incredible job and is only going to get better and i cannot wait to see them do it live in front of an audience it is just going to be magnificent i love it when an audience is so surprised at how talented these students are particularly stanotte know and they see how being about in a broadway musical really brings out the best in them and i love how surprised in florida rosenstein a small wallerstaetten answered it has been manliest extraordinary students effort and so many of the students have got on to do so many amazing things the administration small minute way to play a part in that is just overwhelmingly wonderful and anatomist and the initials year as finer director and it makes you sad to antionette know that god has a new person to bring in that going to be amazin and the traditional carryin so it's a changing of the guard and i excited to see what's going to continue on with our finance that i despite all of you guys to know i love you at all my heart and i wish god's very very very best for you lucy
