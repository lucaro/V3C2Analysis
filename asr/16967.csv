0.03,20.22, our next presenter is dr lucasian who's an independent consultant specializing in partnership development in july of this year lured from the dochmiac company where he was director of university or by strategy building collaborations between down a university partners and perhaps most importantly he was the utrera
21.03,25.26, good afternoon i guess everybody my hook
26.34,85.62, thanks a lot for comment and taking your time to talk about this issue i think it's really important to continue to have a public dialogue about university industry government partnerships and think that's where things change and a kind of an opportunity for every understanding
85.92,99.03, i'll talk a little bit about the benefits to the university industry and to society in general and what we can do to continue to promote creating a good strong robust program in partnerships
99.78,139.95, when partner at all well they are not going to go through every reason because there's a million reasons the partner but just to touch on a few and michael mentioned a couple of things already from an industry sanitaetsrat of andreas that are strategic to us so by providing the not just funds but providing the opportunities in the definition of technical problems that are important and are relevant to us and making sure that students
141.36,226.29, what's really important about having a strong partnership but a very deep level as you begin to really understand the needs of each other a university has different needs industry as different needs and sometimes they are a little bit in conflict but by having a strong partnership you can work through those and find ways to get through those things one of the things that was mentioned as the charioteer alongshore
228.09,278.16, you uncover opportunities that you maybe didn't see when you entered into a partnership and one thing i'd like to bring up and this is outside of collaborations we recognized through the strong partnership that we had that there was a real opportunity to help the universities improve their safety culture industries made big investments over many years and making sure we have a good strong safe culture and universities at a situation where people are coming in from high school and aloud their faced with alingayen deliberately
278.22,324.06, and worked with them to help them understand how we go about creating that culture that help them create an interdependence safety culture that appropriate for them and i think that was really well received he really is helped the universities and their environments and we took a lot of what we did egalitarian
325.02,328.83, like to talk a little bit about the collaborative nature of
329.7,332.82, university industry projects
333.0,340.14, again it's a lot more than the funds of their provided vibe able to do research
340.14,396.39, the things that are brought to the table on the industry side are strong scientific collaboration when they're done right that's where the impact is you have weekly monthly discussions going on between university and faculty and students in some cases we see times see projects across a number of groups were students actually had their sort of go to person in industry that consult with on a regular basis to take some of the informality at a getting together a new project reviews and justification
396.39,404.04, then having students come to our locations as coming to their locations on a regular basis that's a lot of resource it goes into it
404.13,421.23, then to follow on to make those programs successful and get out and society in the kind of investments that have to go on in terms of the development the scale up and even the marketing and sales is huge its huge in comparison to the research dollars i go into starting these projects
423.93,473.91, the partnership benefits for these kind of these kind of collaboration one of them and i think michael touched on this is the relevance of projects that the industrial partner can bring to the table were all doing a lot of relevant science but to try to get that the technology that you developmental ostentation
473.97,479.76, by bringing these teams together there's a lot broader idea generation so you're taking
479.82,499.95, really strong minds from industry and academia together and let's remember a lot of these industry people just came out of academia as it's not there's not that big a separation you bring us a lot of thought processes together to tackle a problem and it can really re benefits so that's really good
500.28,503.22, for the programs
503.22,504.15, well
507.9,526.56, we want to do is continue to maintain a strong university industry partnership and we do that at the leadership level as well as a scientist level that allows us by having leaders involved at the university partners together were to lieutenant
526.65,545.61, it helps us understand the culture helps within the industry to understand the university culture and i think we understanding each other you can make a lot more progress if you teach
545.82,558.96, very important thing is to have some consistency you know any kind of partnership for smaller professional you want no surprises you want to try to avoid surprises and i think you need an understanding of each other to be able to do that
559.08,565.05, and if you get leadership with common objectives they can work together towards a common goal
565.47,569.73, it's a win win proposition really this whole partnership continuum
569.73,572.01, the universities
572.55,585.03, industry and government can do things to continue to make a better keep looking at new ways of partnering universities i think an do a good job and trying to create an environment that
585.03,629.28, sustained university industry collaboration partnerships okay not just be guys but little guys a lot of times the big companies you know they have a lot more money to throw around so sometimes that's more attractive but i think for the universities they need to continue to find ways to work with any industry industry industry investments making sure that we have really strong long lasting collaborations and from a government standpoint they need to pay the path help us pay the path to collaboration opportunities and by that i mean to major things are looked for was to reduce barriers
629.28,658.02, to collaborating any barriers related it rules and things like that they get get them out of the way let the universities and industry come up with a way that they can work together that makes sense for both of them to keep a collaboration going and another way i continued to forefend
658.5,659.79, thank you very much
