48.24,50.82, the same completely out it
53.28,54.69, leaders
54.78,57.39, the moon moving it now and the
57.75,63.0, scream and i had the land stop down to
64.77,68.94, hair pass f sixteen because anything
69.09,72.48, and it just gets crazy brightened
73.65,75.78, and up and she
77.4,79.26, to
79.71,84.6, completely blown out and lands is a fervent 
85.26,87.54, and there it
98.58,100.26, a pretty cool
104.07,109.92, this is on a cannon before landing you guys about and
110.97,114.84, have the dealer engaged if i turn the dealer off
116.64,118.83, without the dealer and then the
119.37,123.12, blown out because you gained two stars of light
123.78,127.23, engage the double that he lose
127.74,129.36, the light
130.68,132.12, see the moon again
139.59,142.86, this back in a center
158.13,160.17, it more of a sum
160.41,161.64, actually
164.07,181.56, i like to do this test again once i get the black magic pocket silencer because then it would have a two point eight eight crop instead of a two times crop so that you'd have the two point eight eight along with the
182.28,184.71, engaged in the land so
184.71,185.73, a little bit
186.12,187.89, image the man
