0.03,25.65, because of the love and trust the animals have for us
26.19,34.02, lost their fear of humans and the only thing left is curiosity and general only wanting to meet and maybe even share
34.47,36.06, humans who come here
36.12,39.54, very interested in trying to connect but there's some tea there
40.44,43.05, within about five minutes the fear is gone
43.41,45.12, animals are to trade
45.12,47.25, people aren't afraid
47.58,49.11, it happens
49.56,52.44, then this connection is beyond words
52.8,57.33, tiens you understanding of the nature of life and the nature of animals
57.69,61.98, are to be seen at gahan being deserved to be seen
62.1,66.69, it is not just a human but the being that it is
66.93,69.15, to be seen and loved
71.04,75.99, to have animals that you could start to learn how to connect with
76.35,80.25, food acting almost like a translator
80.4,82.86, the underlying goal of what is fire is
82.86,84.6, the people see the beauty
84.81,86.22, the richness
86.58,94.65, the mystery if you will and there the wonder of what on this sort with us in forest
94.89,101.79, the animals are able to and want to offer
102.3,112.11, a change in a way people see and not its as wolves bears but as individuals
112.98,114.6, because of a fear
114.63,123.12, familiarity with them we only see animals when the hunting on the wild or frightened wedder stand when another cross species
123.12,125.07, a unique opportunity
125.88,130.62, people to understand animals that you would in narrowly cannot get to know
131.49,133.68, help people get to know them
134.43,136.26, in that sense broaden
136.44,144.84, understanding of things and deep in the connection to willie what he began to live with him he began to see their individuality
146.01,149.58, we refer to the animals as ugly
149.91,157.83, stoops to be a goodly barnacle who happens to be a badger almost everyone appreciates it against it by the way
158.7,166.5, apologize from sorrow's gloom course he was close for happens to be a badinot just a badger
168.96,175.74, how many look at it heard of that a thousand buffalo a echeandia
175.8,178.11, he responds different
180.12,186.0, all that came towards me was this heart the spiritful before that
186.06,188.16, i just started seeing her
188.37,193.26, like the way she wants to be seen now that sense of
193.26,199.38, you know wanting to be seen for all of whom she is and what she is and she just showed that time
199.77,205.17, being like that that's so incredibly powerful and so big
205.2,207.48, really get matched very often
208.8,209.97, a beautiful
210.33,212.7, he was a great teacher to spend
213.48,214.59, he
216.48,220.32, a saltatory touched me deep
222.81,225.54, my heart
226.23,231.21, as human beings are relationship to nature the evolving
231.51,234.51, and we've tried several models so far
235.32,241.08, they all have to limitations so we need to keep working a new models
242.49,250.89, how to relate to nature and earth fire can help with that because you can start to look at nature differently as
250.95,260.52, nature out there but nature's part of us animals are to strange beings out there but being on this forthwith us traveling the same journey with us
260.94,265.14, as a culture and is a time i think we're starting to move in that direction
265.86,269.4, and it has a really important part to play in that
270.57,285.45, a major goal of fire is to help in large or sense of community to include not just people really important but also animals are also really important at all the living beings on the earth to enlarge or sent
285.45,288.21, community and to have our animals here
288.54,294.72, because the comfortable with people can act as translator between the wild and humans to find a way
294.84,301.02, to relate differently but just like a great book and open her eyes and feel
301.65,310.83, help them see the possibility of developing an intimate relationship with the wild animals that have around them the odour would chuck our fox
312.06,313.2, all
313.47,315.0, individual beings
315.15,318.63, on the door for us to a deeper connection with nature
318.96,321.54, what i hope for square can offer the world
321.75,343.41, and here ceasing can see all the different personalities than mose noting the world the either aggressive or submissive but here i can see a hole in the actually happy just through accident
343.83,346.68, another of them
347.04,351.54, really moving because my whole life i have
351.9,367.62, automatically felt this way about animals something like this operation that can just give people that momentary opportunity to see it's not only that these creatures
367.74,381.93, the same capability they are the same and in fact every creature has compassion and so to observe that animals are more than just some kind of genetically programmed instinctual
382.11,384.51, and
384.75,392.52, fire can help it this by seeing the potential for suffering in all
392.55,393.75, being
393.78,398.85, and then the way that it makes us feel happier
399.42,401.49, try to believe that in some way
403.11,406.38, we started this place with just
406.41,410.31, salary when normal salary and
410.58,419.49, sense somehow what will we be do with it and started in two thousand and were a place now a we have
419.79,421.38, physical facilities
421.44,423.0, not much death
423.78,424.74, yet
425.01,427.98, just on the verge of
428.7,447.33, all these years of thinking and being with the animals and learning what the animals had to say and thinking about how to convey it to people and taking by the head of share of people and thinking of how to make the best use of this incredible resource we have here an unusual combination of things of animals
447.66,449.82, and john's talents and
449.88,453.42, my own type of thinking together
455.64,460.29, the verge of being able to start to take it out into the world
460.89,463.98, fisher is to help
464.04,467.73, one way of living together on this earth
467.91,470.43, it's not about me it is not about a
470.79,472.71, and is not about
473.43,475.2, even
475.74,480.99, about possibilities of a different way of being in the world with one another
481.59,493.53, he
494.04,496.83, he
