565.26,566.67, i feel
566.7,569.7, ready can take your yoga strap
572.49,575.64, in the green to play so you strap

594.21,597.27, extend your right leg straight in the air
598.56,600.06, feeling
600.12,611.28, sensations along the back of your right leg all the way to the back of your heel from your buttocks keeping the connection to the back of your leg in the ground

785.16,823.8, so as they say here focusing on home charity's class and nuclei davy translates proletariat in chapter two artery eight tonelessness as devoted to living a balanced in moderate life promethea the scope of one life force becomes boundless so in my live a life of moderation and balance rather than the excess that this time of year nears nears resolutions demand of us the springs are life into balance and harmony
823.8,858.45, but ofering balance to a divine nature are true nature so that we don't have to try to fix her change yourselves or try to search for some kind of perfect a solution for ourselves were already perfect pay and they are going to switch sides so hooker strap around the ball of your left foot now and then draw your left leg in the only need to draw it in until you feel something happening on the back if your left leg

1104.24,1115.67, the intention here is to release your spine and your spine you in to breathe out and round up through your back and then you get a breath in an arch through your back
1115.85,1124.88, when we come into the new year with resolutions that are excessively demanding of our physical
1125.12,1126.98, our mental
1128.0,1131.03, emotional and spiritual bodies
1131.27,1135.74, this is from care out of balance
1136.94,1147.35, and when we're talking about this it is alike were talking about non productive expenditures of energy

1187.37,1215.06, we do things it causes an outflow of energy and it's up to us to tune into whether our actions drain or energy or give us energy from chartres as extending only the energy we need to live in harmony to certain activities such as the activities that are associated with new ears resolutions often such as starving or bodies
1215.69,1217.61, overexercising

1632.75,1638.6, if we spend all our time wearing a better the future we will lose a lot of energy
