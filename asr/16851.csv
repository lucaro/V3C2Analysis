0.03,5.28, where have had number one
5.91,11.04, you tommy came and your son are making the coolest videos
11.43,12.96, how did this start
14.04,15.63, many of human
16.35,18.03, more in the works
18.63,37.41, certain making these movies earlier in the year you have made a few little sort of time lapse in the stations of but a slight to do a drawing before but i was never really that happy with a quality of them oh my solemnly with his cane camera using the film this which is a flip can
37.44,38.97, pretty good camera
39.12,47.31, for what it is but early in the year i got to this which is a cannon seventy which is incredible camera
49.23,74.82, and shoutings that could go on the air as a demonical restive show and you couldn't you know went all kinds of lenses to put on it by them and you could do almost anything that he would do with the professional evermoving camera or had completely transformed the quality of what were making and that made it worth putting a lot more effort into making really good films with story you know
74.91,80.94, capture the whole art of artistic process so so far we made
81.03,84.36, a dozen of these little films would make
84.36,94.62, about me and we've made one about tommy caine who was an old friend of mine who's been a collaborator on most of the films ever since
94.62,113.97, and then we made a couple of other films about people who honestly neither of us who knew before but got to know through the process of documenting how they work one of whom was an animated another with a tattoo artist and we have a bunch of sort of ideas of future people would like to make films of
114.09,146.67, it feels like these little films are you know have a chief one of the goals and we had in making them which was to create films that would stand alone and it would just get people excited about drawing and about the drawing process and show them what goes on behind the scenes and you know ultimately it would be cooperation the different kinds of people who keep illustrated sketch books and all the different ways that they do that so that my gigantic ambition for one day we'll see if we get around to doing that
146.97,163.74, having fun making little shells like this and try to explore like how exactly do you take a process that could take somebody a half an hour for several hours and turned into a film it sustains interest the last for about
163.8,167.97, reformers as that idea for a film
168.09,170.1, about as
170.49,183.39, petit seems like people have such specific things about manatoline to use and so forth so it might be interesting to do condoling fill about that but different people
183.39,188.49, why they like them what they do with them and so that something
188.64,223.08, montacute is a fun project and you know we make one every month montalban my son has been evolved as the sort of saratoga her in one of these an forces going off to college so we're going to have to figure out how to go on without without his contributions but missus been really fun experience to work together to explore this contingency
223.38,236.61, i mean i'll be honest with you there days to pass that i don't draw there have been weeks to pass that been months that assuan you know what seemed to happen is if you missed
236.67,244.65, in the next day betimes and eventually you just fall out of the habit you get rusty and it feels like a shore and
245.13,249.69, i really i shouldn't talk like closing
249.84,263.64, something that gives you turn right in like sin they should do because you want to do it and so i find that it would fighting if i stopped drawing for a period that i get back into it 
263.76,266.16, i asked myself why do i ever stop
266.16,272.07, i lose that habit and you know it makes me happy to keep doing it so
272.49,275.85, not an every day thing but it's certainly an every year thing
275.85,288.99, a year has abati have been drawn and you know i find like right now i'm in a period where i'm drawing at least every day often more than that and its fantastic can't wait to do the next train tapping said you know
288.99,295.26, i don't think drawing should be like going to the dentist and you know it should be
295.41,297.33, i sunday
297.48,300.42, something that i try to do regularly
300.6,304.29, and so from up with it which i did it more

618.78,619.59, and
620.19,628.77, what i like about this book is it shows all the variety and different ways in which people you know interpret the human form
628.86,635.43, of its abstract a lot of its pretty figurative but he is set a range to intercity afire ally inspiring
635.49,644.55, and you know flitter basis to just think about how i draw people and to think about different ways in which you can interpret some form

778.53,781.41, the latter that he has
781.83,791.67, way that he captures people the way as he draws buildings he drew sometimes very very intensity tail at the time to leave areas empty
792.27,794.07, emphasize that detail
794.1,795.66, he's also a great
796.26,799.05, saturnalia
799.41,806.64, endless inspiration in this book for me and i think it's worth you know this so many books
806.64,809.4, pashepaho different copies of it
809.52,820.95, and is a book that's been out of print for ages men you can find on the internet and i've also posed in pages from it on my whissendine but that's really a great book as are many of his others

860.85,866.73, he travels to interesting locations and tries to find stories bind them
866.91,867.72, and

878.82,880.38, father into a pan
880.59,883.32, a greek book and i go back to tom again
883.41,886.5, in several editions of it he can find it around
886.65,887.97, as a book
888.27,892.23, they were gentlemen

921.81,923.58, sometimes it's muted
923.82,926.76, puts in detail where it's needed
927.0,929.22, a kind of a cartoon
929.34,934.32, the vibrance to his work at other times it 
936.24,937.74, potential
937.83,946.17, this huge variety to it and again lots of different things you can learn from looking at it and his books are dense with lots and lots of drawings
946.26,950.37, then not to be as interesting to me to talk less about
950.85,953.13, of drawing and their morsel
953.31,956.76, books that are as i travel coffee table books but
957.15,962.58, you know he's the many many books that he's put out and i strongly recommend him david gentleman

986.31,1001.25, future plans and dreams no traitor started draw my life is changed in so many complaints and i think i found that in a course of sharing that
1002.3,1007.82, and explaining to people that it's possible to overcome your anxiety about
1007.88,1009.8, drawing a creativity
1009.98,1018.62, come all those lousy or teachers you might have had it and you know to make drawing into a regular part of their life
1018.71,1020.48, is that to be profession
1021.11,1023.66, something on to do and i think
1023.93,1034.13, i think about my dreams and fantasies and chaplain to the future there all kind of a round that notion doing more with that
1034.55,1035.75, i find that
1037.1,1038.12, experimenting
1038.33,1040.49, experiment i find
1040.82,1042.17, new energy
1042.44,1044.27, and you think that i want to do
1044.81,1046.43, first it was just
1046.49,1048.17, going and making it a habit that was
1049.7,1050.57, the
1052.49,1054.23, keeps going on and on
1054.47,1058.88, now you know my life is changed so romantic east couple of years since any died

1068.78,1071.6, incredible for me and i want to do more with it
1072.05,1077.9, seem to be climbed that way as if more energy for more ideas and getting more feedback
1078.11,1081.59, keep going and i think that that's really incredibly light way that
1082.01,1083.57, you know in spite of the
1084.62,1085.67, they have happened
1088.1,1092.24, surface and low and
1092.48,1094.67, couragement and ration

1131.78,1137.84, what the participate to show the way but how this can be done and i figured out that what we're doing
1138.02,1139.82, that's kind of my grand
1140.03,1142.37, hope for the future is that we do more that
1142.37,1152.3, do it together used technology to share it to bring people in and yet not forget that it's really in the end just about a piece of paper and a pen and the cording your life
