1.02,29.88, so i'm very very happy to be here and as the italian of course i have to say that my talk probably will be again about granny i don't know why as italian we we love genius part of my story of my biography as a scholar as a etiologist and that's why
30.06,42.15, actually when i invited me here i thought i had to be really true and i will i will try to explain
42.9,49.44, nine friends i i love them and i have loved them if you have them
49.56,51.87, he was told to be
51.96,77.94, because at the end of the day as the national biologist we have not put much soul poor on in the soup but we have met people they have taught us and they have they have really had the remarkable role in teaching the amount of soul and of course the variety of soleure in the soup
80.28,81.96, sally
81.99,83.46, friends
83.58,105.63, you see strange names from different parts of the world i would like to begin with two very important father and mother of the bolognese important in bringing me
105.63,128.13, the idea that science has to make a step down science has to establish a dialogue with the local communities because the local communities and the traditional knowledge may be now much more than we know and
128.46,155.7, indeed there was this wonderful expression to say that the culture and nature are very like the reconstructive link mysteriously between culture and nature and of course there above important in my life for lettin letting me appreciate the spiritual value of bidders
155.73,176.13, by the first is not about plans ananias only is about the way we look at them and these ways we look at them the way we perceive plans and animals and the environment is sometimes very very important much more important than probably our
176.97,181.17, and brothers in the bitterest word
181.71,183.06, of course
183.21,188.04, they need the for a trans dicipline and human science
188.52,199.98, come back to this and i want to just to begin to say thank you to the two persons they are not more among us but they gave me a lot
200.1,216.9, they told you are the italian renegade these are three marvellous old woman from a very tiny little village in south and italy inhabited by a brash the brash are descendants of albanians
216.9,226.83, and that these three women in different ways have changed the way or i am i had in my mind the bottom
227.88,231.24, when i began to do this work
231.3,253.56, i thought there is a plant kingdom of course and this plan kingdom as it is to tinman university classes that is classified this categorized according to families this to three old ladies told me stead
253.56,260.7, many many days that the idea of classifying plants is very different
260.7,264.87, and actually they had the category for
264.87,300.24, specific group of plan which included the the idea of ability tartarean not be translated in the scientific language they are the plans they grow in environment they are pretty disturbed by but the human beings and they can be eaten and they were eaten they were gathered they were blanched they were generally and they are still fried with aliveness the category of rakeshin we do not know in the science and that
300.27,311.73, brought me to the strong feeling that they the belinchon and we have in the science and not enough
314.91,336.09, established this dialogue between the science and tradition knowledge is not an easy job and for all our theologies the first important and difficult story is he to try to translate what specific vernacular term means
336.78,401.07, temperance and the first important problem we have is that the one to one correspondent never exist many times people may name different plants with the same the natural term is that wrong nor is very right because according to the idea of an they may exist a plan they have similar tastes or they have pundits or they may be used in similar ways for example in south italy in this village marsh worth which is the wild panaches very close to the test of celery and water cresses are named with the same term is that from now it makes perfectly sense and even the mental map of plants the people have in traditional culture is very different from what we have in the books of botany
401.34,439.8, example a maranatha they are generally named in the same kind of fleece they are used the insular ways and much more interesting is that these men tomatoes depend very heavily from where the plants are gathered they are another in other words mental map day considered ecology of these plants the buttons not so far yet and that's why i think we had the menetares
441.87,447.87, buttons and probably many scientists around the world too much time they
448.38,455.7, as they went in different places in the world and they pretend to know things but actually what we should
455.88,459.87, i listen and then listen again
460.02,474.48, this is a very interesting feature of the negatron mine this village people according to the bitterness of plant classified plants for our medicine and he is a very interesting
474.6,501.63, stuff which is in between different species of taliation sumed because they are believed to be very healthy now this we know from the form cologist this plans are the most antedate plants we have in europe and they are still consumed according to this footnoted system
503.67,522.54, knowledge systems than profoundly imbedded in the local landscape in the language in the history we cannot really divide this is culture this is nature is just the result of the cabotin defect that in these gastronomics were used a certain things
524.13,526.71, reaching certain as
526.92,541.83, the fourth person i would like to talk about is another very important teacher for me is that one of the lasters worn begins and living in a very isolated area in albania to sing a done
542.34,557.76, one of the most nacheral plays in the europe and they are the people that be noways alister used their plans according to very unique features
558.12,560.04, example to sin
560.07,580.02, to me that saleratus from wild orchids may be a wonderful and delicious food in the winter when the people and especially the kids feel few to see he tore me that even in natal or beach so
580.23,585.36, a dignity and he has to be respected not only when other
585.57,613.26, of the family at it but when animosity this is his in fact is so which is prepared only for the cows and then only this way the cows according to the knowledge of justina may produce a delicious milk which will then fit in all magnificent very productive for which these mountains are very famous
613.32,664.8, but to single out another important story that the traditional knowledge changes a bull is not just static is not just additions traditions are made by continuations innovations and actually after the communist in north inania people went back to god a sale and other plants much more than they they were used to do during the communists so in a kind of magic way traditional knowledge was revitalized why because of course during the deposition tains many problems arises public health problems rivalry of care was very very difficult
664.83,666.06, that
667.05,678.63, me that traditional knowledge if there is salt of a continuous coition between human beings and and what we call nature
680.64,682.47, as to
683.01,698.25, friends in station i would like to talk about our two friends they come from very different word or an is the russian german who migrated back to germany a few years ago after the family
698.4,702.66, leave being in russia for more than years
702.66,716.04, a migration and rosalie is one of the last venetians living in eastern roumania in a wonderful lively landscape close to the dane
716.31,719.46, wonderful woman
719.52,721.26, me that
721.38,759.21, even the representation of traditional knowledge may change over time of course they could remember and still do of course the marmalade jam with the flowers of the indian wonderful women and not to forget of course the lack of fermented the vegetables they could be actually probably very useful dissenting after the european state
759.24,782.34, consider very very healthy against drunkness but the rational and from these two ladies was that he even tradition knowledge is a fact is experiential is very much represented that means we
782.64,805.83, probably about things we are attached to in different ways depending on the person we have in front of us so in one word the tradition knowledge and you of course as she nor these better than me is narrative is a way of representing an experience and then is the way to which we negotiate or identity
806.76,808.71, so where
809.64,811.53, that you go from here
813.24,814.41, in
814.8,816.33, that is
816.9,836.94, actually finally because i rode these before coming here and yet the delivering a athinking that what we have experience and so far yesterday we had the wonderful day were the reentered is part of what i drafted as as a dream what is important
838.41,839.79, feed
840.21,854.97, appetite for by our culture the verities and to celebrate the these diversities we need platforms like the one we are now thank you very much enfolding such a senator
855.12,872.82, often scientist live in a tower and of course many of other stakeholder leaving another word we need platonical talk together and i think is so important then we can share our experiences we can share our knowledge
872.85,887.91, the important point in my opinion education we need desperately need of platform to which we can educate young people and we can reduce each other
889.92,894.84, we leave in a time of crisis of problems and they think
895.02,902.31, these networks will also facilitate the building 
902.37,907.32, catherine which is that very much needed in this time
907.47,919.77, resilient is a very nice word but actually in practice is what local communities in many parts of the world every lie every legionary every day
919.92,921.54, and then
921.54,929.22, let me go back to the idea of very pose about the spiritual value by the varsity when we talk about
929.25,937.89, food when we talk about going out to manage in natural environment at the end of the day we talk about care
939.87,941.91, food providers
942.9,944.4, shefford
947.55,949.41, a provides
949.5,961.98, and we need to care i think very much each other in order to appreciate the this value which is the probably the most interesting essence of by the verity
967.68,971.16, what this may mean in our
971.25,974.28, beside the large for scientists
974.28,981.21, for four days i don't know but i think we need to
981.57,988.86, in space and time from for this labor because these are very very important
988.98,1010.67, and then we come to my last friend my later and probably most important and mysterious friend divine of the wise elder of the one of the first nation on vauversin in canada i spent many many days with him alone in the middle of the forest and talking about by a cultivate
1010.73,1022.85, many many times i told me you know at the end of the day and a thesis your concept is the concept of the people they come from the western culture they think
1023.03,1024.59, by ology
1024.65,1032.12, nature and culture were divided and that's why they needed to build the new words but actually
1032.78,1034.61, keeping me saying
1034.61,1042.56, what you express we would express in another way we would just say i shoots savile
1042.8,1046.37, everything is one everything is connected
1046.76,1051.83, since everything is one i think we can also say we are all one
1052.01,1077.24, very much and took a stone and onesime lights and some one questions for and revolution here
1077.63,1079.49, the football hopefully
1083.57,1092.06, the abilities not kindle kendrick to try to melt science with the knowledge
1092.81,1100.16, he no assassin is as a scientist i think we made the
1100.43,1111.17, be open minded and to recognize that in specific domain i don't want to say in in many things but in many domain
1111.83,1115.52, science is not given
1115.61,1138.62, most final word we need that to learn from the people they have lived together with nature for centuries and lena because we doubt this kind of experiential knowledge also our creativity and innovation is very mutilated so in my opinion and
1138.8,1143.93, a mean the cience should do another in the jobbery body has to
1144.05,1151.4, continue to do its job the battened a dialogue we need finally dialogue
1151.67,1170.93, let me honest all these delicious products you probably use in your quinine come from farmers come from fishermen as we have seen these morning they even knowledge and they have a knowledge which is probably not embedded in the agronomy and botanise in our
1170.99,1172.16, it
1172.22,1186.41, that's why you have i think you folks have it in amazing roll in in trying to build this platform and to reconcile these different kinds of knowledge at the end of the day probably
1186.53,1192.08, me say tradition knowledge and science and they are fruit from the same tree
1192.8,1194.06, beautiful
1194.15,1197.39, the different fruits and we need to appreciate
1197.57,1200.0, i and the other together
1200.54,1203.54, sorry not for emilie that
1203.93,1209.93, kind of thought reason kind of operation when you think about
1210.11,1216.62, otto different concept than you got something like his biancone again to this concept but
1216.68,1226.76, i think you can not time you can not think that you can do science and grow with the land
1226.76,1230.0, think that the stars can influence this process
1230.09,1233.45, it is very easy to give this
1233.45,1235.37, his message to the people
1235.46,1239.57, to begin a work that has been never done his challenging
1240.17,1249.08, there are of course but one we cannot go now in detail the many battles but is the work in my opinion that is urgently needed
1249.38,1266.66, okay any more questions and retarded the important aviation to share ideas and talk so that all we should be doing andreino grapes are often in a race to capture and record a culture preserved before it disappears can you
1266.69,1278.33, your view on the cultures that you're looking at this strength the ability to survive in an an evolving world and also how it passed on that knowledge so that you know it doesn't get lost
1278.69,1299.93, this is also our responsibility because we have built the wrong idea that we have all answers we have built a fake idea in front of local communities they had historical much less power in the world that we can see everything so i think we have also the responsibility to
1300.08,1312.62, work together with the local knowledge in addressing the problem of the transmission we needed to reach still this knowledge we need of course to marry this knowledge with the modern science with innovation
1312.62,1317.18, i think we cannot escape from this responsibility
1317.24,1333.17, and then many communities all over the world i think are more and more aware now of this kind of subtle interstitial obliterate
1334.4,1337.07, let's think about the languages
1337.1,1344.12, languages are music and we are losing languages every day more than we lose plants
1344.21,1365.6, but of course since we are what we are and we are in the especially in the past we can to locate more attains but not a music so i think we have a responsibility we cannot leave all in the hands of local communities they are very often marginalis
1365.6,1369.53, okay one last question quick question
1369.71,1371.99, short answer where her question
1373.67,1375.53, the 
1375.92,1379.85, a short answer is and riding
1380.21,1392.78, i'm not sure it's a short answer not long ago i sat in a meeting of chefs who were told that science needed to come into the kitchen much more that 
1392.84,1399.98, the kitchen was a place of wives tales and false knowledge and so wondering
1400.13,1419.75, if it is really communication and not knowledge the language of that these two different groups speak that is the issue and if so how you if you could quickly suggest a way to communicate better amongst ourselves said nicholson yeah i think that actually
1419.81,1421.79, we need the tool
1423.2,1441.68, to go out from our towers this is the main point because it is true that of course a science should enter into the kitchen i would like to say and believe me this is not just to make you happy that i would like to see more farmer senses
1441.89,1467.96, the universities i think that we need the two to go out from our tower very strong because the athens of the day knowledge is not just a body of something that is that just her not knowledge has to be embedded with practice and you are the real let's say expert of practice
1467.99,1477.86, you are the heroes of practice so i think you can understand probably much more than me and then callers or this dialogue has to happen
1478.01,1488.45, of course it is a very open task i don't have any recipe exact recipe in my pocket
