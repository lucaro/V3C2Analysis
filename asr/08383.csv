0.12,23.19, antisthenes sowerby arboriculture but you with your tomatoes
23.4,40.74, yeah i mean the transport so like they are now loubette double court in the trader is more
40.83,43.47, competition based but it's also
43.77,46.32, in a progression as
46.47,55.29, so you got the hat want to do it because they need to do it for the competition and then the guys that need to keep themselves at that level and want to do it for their video parts or whatever
55.65,58.83, and we definitely i mean we had that
59.01,62.1, that time but there are different degrees i don't think it was
65.04,69.27, if not cut through but like if you were at the contending dubieties
69.3,70.65, to have
71.37,73.62, he even and
73.98,79.02, switch on probably like a cap seven or caption in
79.05,83.13, you're going to win a contest because that's kind of where it was that
83.73,87.3, the debts i mean by today's standards that's like nothing now
87.87,90.6, but then you know if you talk about
90.75,91.95, and
92.37,94.86, the tree quite as
96.81,101.7, dictated as they seem to be now you know like you say you got the tents and the
103.26,110.61, i gueth guy that doesn't know what he's doing whereas pansette like uplook like old mushroom cap or something
111.9,116.7, we don't necessarily have those dress but we did have trends obviously toward
117.48,120.45, i adopted
120.45,123.69, that was just like one trend that really caught on
124.5,130.62, i cut down boards and whenever i was going to the bag super baggy pants or practically averse
130.77,136.38, that was definitely a super prominent trend but at that time we you know you aren't like
136.44,139.74, the other i mean if you're a rock or maybe you just more of black
140.22,144.87, and you didn't and he didn't have the baby pat he just wore the same old
145.17,163.02, ben learned yeah i mean i think i think fastidious is good and happy to see the fun in it the fasteneth
163.14,171.06, when you talk about with a holdin out or where or some one like that where you know we needed a new stone like a more fitted cut
171.3,174.39, people and not just the giant baby
176.4,179.01, a negative side you know you've got
180.39,189.27, the guys that are sponsored for more of their image than the riding like the cold you know some decent tricks or hand rail or whatever and stand up to
189.63,192.03, about the right level as far as
192.09,193.59, stout
193.86,198.96, there supervened and the basic skills are like parting and smoking cigarettes
199.32,206.31, that part is negative i think for the industry but at the same time you know it is good to have personalities
206.43,212.88, some guy that's just that person's personality and it's not really her fault that there's faltered and they're not that great i mean that's
213.45,215.01, industry
215.49,222.12, drawing on to that person and saying we need that guy when he the goniometer toland smoke in your sins and then
222.3,223.74, maybe to a
224.55,249.39, well i think you know that there's the problem where no matter what the writers the judges are not always disconnected i mean i know a lot of great guys that are now past brooders who are judges
249.84,253.89, sometimes the judges are just morally scoring for
254.13,264.75, duty and there's really in most inmost contents there's no format that really involved style like this easily you know amplitude
264.96,270.78, difficulty of creating variation and styles kind of in there but it's not
271.29,273.06, not one of those components
273.09,276.78, i think that's that's some of the problem with contest because
280.14,298.59, for the other day and he was actually saying how you was askin like what a progression of the sport and you know a bit of his answer was that he is not open that it goes to you know quatorze forties but then we bring the style in more to the double course
299.28,306.09, the problem i think is really the it's the way the contests are put together as far as the judging for at if there was an actual
307.65,310.65, that would change a lot of things in leslie
310.92,312.57, difficulty
313.14,317.37, and lettice agatha i teeniest
317.85,322.53, that is a difference but until that styles and actual point
323.76,324.87, just think
325.71,338.13, i don't think it's going to change the cause it's always been this problem that's like why i never did any competition was that
338.22,344.55, a competitive person but no competitive person in a subjective arena
344.64,346.68, i got my subjective
346.74,348.96, to do what i want to do
349.05,350.94, at least stay
351.33,353.16, olive
353.25,355.35, somebody else is going to just do
355.65,358.02, the old days it's a was going to do
358.14,361.86, no and i want to do in a state seven men
362.55,364.02, is out there
364.38,389.28, i mean i don't i'm not really seen much of the positive coming from that i mean it's great for snow boarding i think that the guys are out there in a somewhat getting more exposure outside of snow boarding
389.52,393.75, here you know like over a rolling stone or what have you
396.09,398.22, you know i don't think they're really
398.43,400.32, after using it
401.37,403.2, in the same way that like
403.5,407.01, it is using his cloud
407.22,409.92, the arastra to do something
409.98,417.87, it seems like other guys you know like a dandy cast who has his own show you know with dingo and all that or you know like a
420.33,422.25, it seems like they
422.43,425.31, i don't know it just seems to me like they want to just
425.4,433.41, the career that direction like you know hang out with it and and try to be a rock star of your son with
433.53,435.87, you're not you know not pushing
436.05,461.25, the right direction necessarily but helping well in an ideal world it would be great if
461.4,468.45, i really had a voice and that of the olympics and you know a readable bit about the whole one eighty charter and
468.69,473.13, in the intention here i know that there is you know a bit of conflict
473.64,481.68, there was to be slow sale and how you would qualify verses you know current competitions like the titaresius
484.2,487.62, i don't you know i've heard some people mentioned maybe
487.71,491.16, the organizers of that 
491.31,492.81, over
493.29,496.86, aspect of snow boarding and
497.94,502.17, actually see that is ever being feasible that is and
502.26,506.85, you know i committees are so old school and
507.3,510.84, maybe like all boys club style i don't think that
511.98,514.83, would ever release that kind of power
514.83,515.82, one
515.85,519.72, if they were with us that's great and if you know
519.78,522.69, it ideally in the tear would be
524.13,526.71, a part of the selection criteria
529.71,532.74, qualification for the slopes of that would be great
533.4,535.62, again i just don't think
537.09,540.6, if i ask him is and all that is
542.13,544.47, it's just an old school
544.98,548.64, i don't see them bending much to our will or our
548.88,572.91, much about our desires i don't think it would be realistic that they would do that 
573.18,574.62, i should
575.1,579.81, then one of the men things that come to my mind what i think about
580.14,588.06, to competing type of series and you know is wanting everyone to qualify through fists
589.14,595.95, not going to want to bag those events they want make money off those events and get that attendance and those things are
595.95,603.33, free scheduled events that have been going on that made his lopasnya slow sonnenthal relaxes or not but
605.7,607.29, i just don't see
607.71,613.56, see them saying okay we're just going to trash or series and we'll just like you guys qualify to tear and yet
614.31,628.8, as far as that goes i don't know if they have much reach outside of the core market
629.25,636.75, you know that is a like us to day picked up an article on the ice on eighty there
637.17,641.37, that old deal with tears at a while ago so that
641.43,645.75, bring into the passes especially with us today which is a big deal so
646.98,649.77, we are now working to raise more awareness
651.57,653.28, it's hard to say 
653.43,655.68, bosom thing maybe but
656.16,658.23, even now if
658.56,663.72, now if you had every just about every snow border in a credence
664.65,667.68, i feel like there's still people that would just
669.63,673.59, the picket lines or a cab as it were
673.92,676.8, still to participate in the life about
677.82,700.08, he
