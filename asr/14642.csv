0.0,797.79, i read welcome to so number forty five of the bill pocosan to day regin to bower which is a clinical package manager somebody look at some of the sociated website thetis the bower maid reside bardondon with the basic instructions on how to install it or even in stall the packages and configurations a very short page for a young project but it is definitely very self explanatory next connected to boriawlis or other all the packages that are listed under power is this neatest created by centering as avery neatly lourenco some searches on what are the packages available just a few weeks ago after the goblets were over i also watched beside which i highly recommend you to watch its by dan haberden he asteroid package management bower and he also used it with him angerstein so do geneinetti this is his slide i was very intrigued by this light of his the riches the basically saying that you manator and requires a sort of the two said to for the climate application to your man is basically the the generator of the folding type of application to grant the bill to the bower is the package manager and requires is the modulatory interesting thing all are in heavy development and something very exciting going on but each of these tools so there are so many package managers we have power andersonvilles of package dogskin of install all the modes and the tower is sort of for the clinic i also hindered you to go through this article which is written by cordial another automobile and he spoke in his very detailed article both about p and bower and i would like to point out as specially this paragraph on what power is not because i feel he pointed out exactly where pan bower both has other uses for example in an it uses this kind of common gas modulated to include the various and pious were as power is a little bit agnostic or other flexible later on you see that power we can also used for prosecution the that little introduction a ledge started with power policeman to my command line and inside this project i only have a one simplified which is indeed of astonished pieto install power and it is good to starboard globes were ahead and use this command and install a dashed for global and then bower i already did that so when i do bower dashed as fusion i will get a reply backing it is ropin nine point two of course along with knowing the version the other commanders like to use is the help command of power help is a definitely a very useful command and later on will be using a lot of them prisonlike any other package managers i find that the commands for any package manager is pretty similar to it should be very intuitive and easy to pick up power for any of us so the very first thing we will do is to search for packages to meteors search one of the very common klindworth we tend to use is jerry caleche and search for that so they gradooally jaqueras a lot of jacobus applications now this is hardly an useful because you have so much such a long list so let tegea and search for a specific one how out of the thing for dilatory and the carrosserie reject with forms diavoli us the answer and as some information about it especially gitanos want to specifically know some information about that package we cannot do so and that's my bower in foretasted the interesting thing is it will give us a long list of aversions that available rich is very useful whenever we want to install so that was a little bit about a searching and finding out information about the available packages in the entire boer environment to wait we want to install a jury now other once i come back to my text editor it's only integrated i am inside that folder in the command line to letitia bower install a jerry and i noticed one this happens when we come back to the fold estruch received that the bethelite fulica components and on the open up rescuer and anxiety abilities and every government or even a jacotot development version and as usually be won to unstaled it's really delegato power and install agrarian when we go back to the forest resettlement folder is completely empty now let me we want a particular version of jagoaretes one when we do bowering doll and the package name it will basically give us the latest one as you observe hewitson one and integritate latest one what if you want to have the one point one zero version because you know in jortin old they are not supporting the legacy brocession one point one zero because i want to support a legacy bracefort so in order to do that it will be bower in toggery very same but instead are now we will open the person number with the hassindean one zero great so they go it will install one point one zero why don't we loiter with our isoline soared that we all do it inside the scripture and then the salt attribute and we will find it under the fire decorticated and yet it is version one point one zero so why don't we refer to the path flashed mendaeans up in the brazen widowed to quarrier epitomie up pretty fine and half of the version and a very vergine one point one zero now viewer i see the power of power traditionally what we would do is probably go to the jarred or some kind of can rapide from gogerddan abandoned to our local folder and then refer it that process probably took us a few minutes but over here all we need to do is just to some command lineations and we can switch the versions with a click of warfinger great now this is all good but usually in a project we will have more than one frame work to kind of refer to and base our main project called upon and for this it is probably better to have some kind of manifest while which the power will call in one shot it will install all the framework that are needed so let's go ahead and create the manifest while so right now if we want to create the manifesto of fresh as if for this agility all the dependencies for this project and it's really easy or benito do is just a deleisonon folder senorito that can just as simply do our mash argand then component and averell be back with our plain old age emilie to why don't we create a manifest while and this leoncito a few packages and widest one commanded thoinatai es so i attesteth to initiate this manifest while reassembly do power and then in it and do a name of the project so maybe for this oldest example boer version as your pointing one and once you do that you notice the brand new while bower to jason will be created and alister we can add in the various dependencies in order to include the dependencies real extend the jasome and bedridden denies a hesitating clude some of them so the very first one was a jaguar and here we will include the versions so far as least pinpoint one now the interesting thing about this dependency parmiter is that we can define the framework name on the left or rather as the key and then the value can be the tree are things to watering according to the bower documentation because the three things can be version package or older as you saw here though version name is included what a mingled another package and that is called a moment and limited to a little search about moments so bowershee do have a moment but let me get them in for about it a bower in for moment great so there are many versions of moment available without to take the latest one which is to point robinson the manifold and alludes to notice i have two frame work or rather dependencies that i need for my project so all you need is a bourgeoning to reinstate all went do is to macaroni and then do power and in style so as you can see us finished installing jacare as well as moment and now when we go back to our project folder inside the components for the will find two folders which is jorian moment and yet of course if we open it up you will find the relevant files to refer into our jobs crept or admiring the development of the project we want include one more dependent and aristotle as well as include that one more line in barotseland try that so the merry to entire prison age which is contesting jarrick so to do that will debentures and we would part in a paralytical dash dash save so this will do two things one it will definitely state framework itself and if you come back to the fold the component presumed there and mistletoe prism has been automatically added to the power that jason false time when you do power install it will refer to this treason and take all biddenden that are needed alonso after her all the josselins who don't we go and refer to it not noticing puerile did not change the path but just with female have easily changed the version numb and now and we go back to our little project and be quarters up it is to point supplication is available it is obviously not available because all the behave down loaded it we did not refer to it the for moment it will be component dash moment moment that minute also widower to use moment a little bit so let titus this one which is really easy basically for at the date for us so after requiring all the dependence to be will open up another brand new scrip tag and incite simply calumniously need to enclose it within consolement so that it comes up in the control
798.0,1411.56, and there it was the two years so using this form of installing various packages becomes really easy for us to change the versions and test out because it is just so nodular right so why do we start over once again so i am going to relate the folder and of course you receive that we cannot refer to the fire anymore and in a project for the the components for is completely gone this time or we will initiate a power conflict file to netheravon and big fire we need to create a new pile and college bower or sanartia is another son file one of the parameters is called direct now by default was calebasse a bachelor as it can be lowered or jason as we have already created or it can be even a name of your choice of course to be sure to checkout other aretonville as part of power as right to one we have these three fowls to now we have our eyes are species the conflict file bareheaded is which are particular for this project and last sustenance we have that all we need to do is power and install great alike all the three files of frameworks already do but this time notice that the falderals as he defined it in the bar i aspire and when we open it these other three pounds of course be sure to change them when we go to the indefinitely band of course when we go back to a project the moment as is working late will use power with a requires which is i am easily to be loaded cigar definitely not one of the most forlorn and hunting some deluder such as required as comes in really handy now the other day i was sure reading through another open book by as money writing modulated with m de comminges and harmony i highly recommend tregetour to because as our complex applications grow will definitely use some sort of modulation of make it more efficient and lose coupled creates it have so many scripta all just have a one scripta so the script for required her well firstly refer to require salaries and it will have a dear man attribute bitterer to the project made a carrier at the start i will just go to sing one of my favourite dens to use so let's find requires to be odette one and all the canopy and inside i dearman attribute outdistanced man it will automatically read it as manager go ahead and create that firestone file manages to sit madagascan firstly bewildering the configurations or rather the dependencies of each of the mouth and then we will require each of the modes and make them do some functions and insincere will include some part as i notice first one is jerry cheerily cheery domino we do not need to include the duchies similarly we will also include a moment yes next to be barques the fastened to define all the dependencies to the very first one is sacred in the next one is the moment and the second parameters actually a function and the functional partenheimer vesical used moment manorites becomes a lot more efficient because number one you have only one scripture come back to these parts to define where are the exact ascription and their all being maintained by the bower great snow and be come back and be refreshed the project relenting had seemed to change but we are obviously using required do our modulation now lately before we end sometimes we need patentees only in our development environment seemed give you one example so often use heads up great especially in development environment because i won the sort of grit to be defined as i am coming up the clime application so why don't we go ahead and search for the iciness of found at this point how do you include packages that are not listed in the power to further will go to the decrepit and we were grabbers make sure you choose it and then we will copy this you are come back to barjonas time we will include it in a different pyramidical death dependence and to reconcile gitana called cured and instead of the version number hearken actually include the deputy when we do a fresh installed the components and all do bower in stall the notes theater has installed everything when we go back it is under a libeller as defined in power as evil and it will install all the relevant packages needed including the ones in our development environment to knowledge to our managers and put in the relevant cured colloguin a very simple cord as defined erismann make you redintegratio wrong obviously we did not include it in the confectioner and include it so here you go sugred and of course he alyosha to identify the mode which is great as the function parameters well and of course we will also need the tears now this is also one of the main things about power is that began also refer to decapitate this so to be very similar lives something like this to one again if you notice from the detonator packages and one of them a specifically for the development environment and in our scripture one file commanded we loaded up all the moustiques method even refer to dottie vagaries available and if the honored the great lines are available and visit only for the development environment accoutume other resources that i found very helpful in understanding not only what a package managers in general but of course about our shores one package management for the browse with power the next one is an important article etcaeteras goes and compare not only what are the villalongas but also why and how to use them to nowithstanding behind each of them and next those of course to your man rich is heavily coupled with power as the package manager i recommend to our so use your man if you want to start oscular generate some stuff and lastly barby benary needs sublime that package and you can basically senator you very quickly but it does so you can come here and shift command p and you can go to bower and you can install package from here so why do we try one o they go all the packages tentacle up here so let me just try for the sake of fun temerity surveyed downloading a jollity and you lost so eventually have it as the fullerian gets what very nicely it will automatically included in the doges on fire which is bagfuls as including dash dash saving our command the pretty neat to do check it out and finally father billing of the episode it goes to up to day dad frank and rescued dorg i found this website funereal and also to learn on how to pick up a technologies that are so useful not only on technology they attack about copple amoosin people from whom we can learn from so do go ahead and give this to reside a brush through tons of langtons of inspiration and definitely a big naturalist go there and create something to have fun and hope of power makes you more organised in the clinchophone so that it for this week episode or for power climbing for all other episodes of billboards paranoia one of the five channels are asses get habitues feminine and get your weekly content and i'll see you next week good bye
