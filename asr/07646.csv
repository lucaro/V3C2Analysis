14.22,33.33, the
37.98,46.53, again morning elvanfoot i owe
46.95,48.39, he
49.23,50.07, he
53.28,72.0, so nice to meet you nice meet you on first i am attentions to be but i think it's quite funny you are seem to be very successful
72.84,77.34, we for dorothy meteorites
77.64,84.33, how good that come about when i first started this project in two thousand and six there was
85.62,110.52, small group of people that actually were working on the issue and had been for many many years and what's really exciting as over the past five years there has been this real kind of movement i guess when it comes to the issue a lot of people who want to know more about it policy makers are not recognizing how significant the issue is
118.38,120.63, he
128.76,135.99, but this is the second book in a series of books from this larger project in the where people
136.17,141.87, and focuses on the recommit from burma
141.96,161.61, and it's a group that i've actually spent the most time photographing or the course of these eight years when it comes at least to the issue of state lessness and really is in my opinion like the extreme example of what stateliness can do to a community in the defile of citizens
163.35,171.51, it made two parmachene in citizenship laws to basically exclude this whole entire community from burma
171.66,188.73, so many administrative kind of challenges it had been had been put in place for them by the bernese government that it makes life kind of untenable for them to move forward by the denial of the right to get married without her vision the arbitrary lane seizure for labor
188.91,210.27, really have no access to rights they really they are pretty much the most extreme case of stateliness you find in the world to day
210.33,226.8, reason why really loved books and the reason why i really loved exhibitions is because you know it provides people the time to slow down and to isolate themselves into a space where they can actually really digest the pictures and what the information in the pictures are
226.8,251.34, showing them and telling them in red captions and become more text and have more time to find of just reflect on what the pictures are telling them
251.37,257.85, he
257.94,275.4, how can you photograph a human right here i can do how can you how can the image articulate what a human right is and in a lot of ways it is really difficult to be able to translate that into picture of a way you can do as you can show
275.85,333.0, what life is like when you don't have human rights you know and that you can show the repercussions the by products of not having those rights affect people in their day to day lives this particular communities and once or hainaulters to get them into maladaptation and the rain is exactly that kind of situation and hesitation to wear he has none the paperwork that he does he shows no formal connection to burmese burma denies
333.03,407.55, him and that walter community in existence i mean like he received assistance from it no civil society groups here in amsterdam and all and that basically how he makes it one day after the next year but the fact is that most of these states people including him they don't want to be living a life based on charity you know they want to be half corson creating their own future and and really you know they want to be realizing no andreas that they have and not having that being casabianca couple of years and years i believe and i think that in a way he feels paralyzed like a lot of other states and all were from a wherefrom syria or whether they be from the other countries
407.85,410.46, almost no hope theories
410.61,413.04, it seems to 
413.07,422.91, i think that's one of the questions that i always ask myself you know but i think that that's also the quality
423.54,438.09, i found in state less people of the world is that you know the sistance persistence of the determination the tenacity and the doubt ability of the resourcefulness that they have to be an extent than the end ottaways there you know
438.81,449.04, a lot of them have lost hope but a lot of them you know but equal number of them still have hope that there is going to have a future and particularly younger people you know
462.24,465.0, oh i hope beatoun all
465.15,478.89, you want to talk to the teetotal but died at the peculation on the federation i mean in a lot of ways the situation for stayless pewterer in holland is at they really are incredibly fearful of
478.95,504.03, happened to them if they don't if they are stopped by the police or the don't have the right paper to be able to provide somebody you know and that leads it to detention and needs to you know living a living a life every single day wondering if tomorrow somebody is going to ask you for something that you can provide in a lotta they can't provide that information
505.2,545.97, i think that in early stayless people you know they in many ways they feel like they've been failed by everyone you know they've been failed by the country that they believe as their home because a lot of them are rejected by that country by that state that otriad wherever they have fled too for asylum to try to find a normalized their status and try to belong and they be allowed times failed by those systems too and i think that that's what you've seen here in all yet is that you know the procedures are set up here legally within the country to be identified who they are and also try to find solutions that can
545.97,552.0, i feel safe and secure as there in the process of trying normalization
559.02,574.44, stateliness is an inherited characteristic something that can that is passed down from one generation to the next they have to be anent the child might be registered to her might be registered in my have a birthrate but that doesn't mean that it has a nationality
574.47,609.69, you know and unknown united states any child before on american soil automatically is extended the uses and that's not the case your holland so in a lot of ways would happen is stateless people fleeter home countries are seeking solenhofen they have a child here in holland and because the parent is stateless the child and ends up inheriting that stateliness as well and so what was really interesting for me is that you know what a lot of ways
609.84,626.1, perpetuating stateliness in the country and for youngsters and people who are being born here that it goodfellow they go shirtwaist difference comes into having a residence permanently having nationality where you know
626.31,633.18, president from italy take you so far in my having nationality gives you the longing
633.33,640.59, the third book will be all the work and will show these very unique kind of 
640.68,655.26, stories that each group and each kind of category each place and compasses it at the same time i really hope that it creates one kind of single narrative but i will about what it's like to be a state lessener
657.39,672.0, etienne
