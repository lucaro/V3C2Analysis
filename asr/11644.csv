118.56,132.96, which i entered into ingesta it's i didn't play much garuas more less what i was thinking
132.99,141.87, when we open relation first alone was christian foretaste restaurant careers ago
141.96,164.97, and basically riches and to open a space where we could simply food that could somehow please the palate and challenge the mind at the same time my wasn't so that every creative kitchen was set up in that same fine dining environment that she was there was our dear why would we have to bear with the cast
165.3,171.24, pouring water times a night just because we want to cook high in food

214.83,219.66, no a place for everything would be exactly as we want of it like our home
220.02,225.87, placed not be forced upon us where the thickness of the table cloth would matter
226.38,234.06, we are so many of our colleagues in the last few years to go a bear for one
234.96,246.18, we would put johnny cash on the planet he was strumming his guitar while we would serve our interpretation of what a really great food is we will liberate ourselves from
246.72,254.1, obligations imposed by people's expectations of a great restaurant is about what you can do with high in fruit
254.61,258.27, importantly where now you are allowed to enjoy it
258.51,264.6, to make culinary ventures accessible for the people people just like us we want liberty
268.26,275.88, every crown a dollar or comes with a price a price of liberty and creativity we wanted to start off with nothing
277.35,287.61, as much liberty as possible men having having nothing no crown no europe we didn't want an investor to tell us to put taenarum noticed
288.24,292.53, talking to let's be real
292.56,294.48, no really though money out 
294.96,299.88, the bank ready like massive the great ideas
300.24,308.49, just reduit a project but no money in hand we had a look for some alternative but for big adventure
308.55,315.6, away out of the city center something something cheap cooperant in the popular district of a novel
315.9,321.93, i heard about these creators trying to penetrate a ignorant to create
322.17,324.15, had to be the right bifrost
324.99,339.42, it was interesting to say the least at the moment it was known at the moment it was known as a little christian has managed for sure as was sold by the truckload the whole street was in the grip of these duties
339.69,371.52, people behind the street the good people behind the seat were raving about for me no more people taking interest in the biggest pot in the street a spot that i soon learned was where all the darting with a soul going on now for your flying in from new york so poultices mexico city you think this is a luxury resort and i can understand 
372.12,376.56, the point is there was a small enclosed criminal community here
376.62,379.92, best of this neighborhood and they did not want to return the
380.34,384.75, many suspicious eyes fell upon us as we started travel close a look
384.75,389.1, the small but very chief premeditation
389.52,401.07, just take your hand a bolometer cap you see the street has its share of griffith's normally everywhere but not a shunter young man
401.16,402.21, attention
403.05,409.44, come can see the google car was not much more welcome than we were into those
409.98,415.23, when we come at all a few years later travel boasting a restaurant
415.26,426.93, the camera was in the street and i had to solve that the biggest prices ever and she she very tallying on a block thank you and
427.74,434.49, a young man has left his office in the corner on the everything is well furnished as a benefit calliope
434.55,435.72, this ready
435.87,440.28, a god he's a looking out for cups and rival gangs
440.43,446.97, in the coming or was at its highest and and he was chief
447.48,451.77, euhemerus rather
454.26,457.29, first life
460.5,464.67, i mean beautiful pretty
465.51,473.64, to be a biscuit was used to rent out west be rent for parties and such
473.7,475.44, the recent but
475.74,477.27, completely deserted
477.33,478.38, the
478.68,488.43, i wonder why ever there was a perfect spot for for shady business too to go on and partly for some even better for forester
489.36,494.73, i wooing and we managed to turn what you see here in this
497.13,510.81, that's a key padlocking a dumping the corner just looking at this looking at the classes
512.64,515.52, a young man dreaming of a kitchen
516.33,517.92, that's a young man inside
518.55,527.1, there was about a year later than the previous picture
527.25,532.02, select into the room about after nine months of destruction
532.14,534.9, when you but i that
535.14,540.33, rather setting ready the lease was low possibilities and less
544.29,550.56, to a focus men ridin an impose ourselves on the entirely of a guest night 
550.77,553.89, be able to just come in and joy great food and get the hell out of that
554.97,559.59, it high in gastronomy being the context just a short
560.76,565.68, the talbot and a half hour so we could do to seating letting us prize the menu
565.71,572.85, you want a price is to be as low as we could put possibly afford not to compete with colleagues
573.03,580.68, be able to give the guests a relaxed approach to die high price for me means high expectations
580.71,583.62, potation mean little to surprises
584.43,599.7, anthropopithecus that including twenty five percent deviate if you remove that it rand to make at all makes to you about forty five dollars
599.88,604.95, she is wise we cut down everything but the smile reproached the guest with
605.64,607.74, comes from within avarice
608.22,614.88, one altogether in water the removing crumbs showing it to the toilet
615.12,619.77, want to leave the guest as much impossible to themselves not taking up the whole night
619.98,621.9, to enjoy themselves
622.59,624.27, save time
625.86,630.81, all our culminates in or on the ice table
631.23,633.57, kaetheli
633.72,636.99, very positive though the quality was it
638.1,642.6, i did so there could do a service of otto eighty five guests
642.72,644.73, we just about two or three waiters
644.76,649.89, change everything for us and addition to this but all the food to be served by the chefs
650.22,656.7, the way this focusing keeping the guests happy and supply them with wine and copious amounts
657.03,670.32, you have to remember that the average raging coming is very high workforce being expensive and tricky to get of high quality relation emanated the work weatherford to the absolute minimum
670.53,672.9, so just make sense
673.35,691.8, he was left to be very open for me one of the most important factors when looking for but i want the guests to be greeted by the chef and the chef would be able to control who was coming and going from the positioning of the kitchen way able to see which coming in and make a contact but for me is the key to great hospitality
692.19,696.72, the chef's pick up the phone of the rings the kitchen to lose for ever leave the restaurant
696.93,702.15, the intense purity is something that gets people to understand what it is you
703.08,706.2, and were i not intending to try and hide it
706.41,722.49, tables were made of any the chance second hand as you can see the toilette created as much as the staff on which means all who supplied the guests with the cheapest possible paper white the hands and almost made an extra effort to make a point with how bad the response look like
723.12,742.14, the forcus would be on the food and the wine the speak of roaring johnny cash the who will that underground where such back holiday that we had lots of complaints about the music but we didn't care it was our own thing our house our own music and we decided hollow will play it
742.65,745.8, say that the outwork says a thousand words
746.01,758.13, the man in was easy i must see
758.49,764.82, people understand what we really wanted the restaurant was full for furfur but that's not success
766.38,775.17, almost a year before the opening blogging about what this dream of ours was all about the concept the ideas the philosophy that all the construction going
775.29,778.98, the soft opening showed us what mistakes we already had made
779.1,782.4, the days were not justly but to us just like a
782.76,789.39, the first month we had a big one or couch sitting just in front of the window at the entrance for the boy to hang out in
790.23,814.17, i remember clearly now if he does diagraming to our soft opening peter grant the direct of nomothetae of noise when he could just standing from this position that i took this picture i standing here was looking out of the window the rain was pouring down peterified to the soft opening came in a taxi came out of the taxi all happy as he always is
814.44,824.1, in pouring down him and his wife on the turning the corner and when he turned the corner that when his smile faded away because in that doorway
824.16,829.35, two steps you want down to before you enter where two trackless
831.51,836.37, that they were not be standing in the rain they are basically just blocking our entrance
836.7,849.78, and he had a good appetite for they were eating too out of the takeaway contain as a peartree loftiest of happiness turning the corner they were just
850.35,860.49, she and his wife could just fly through that was one of the many nights i will go back into the back kitchen and place the ship on omething
862.59,868.53, important an australian journalist came came to corinth east of 
868.53,876.6, i read your hat to me that you had to meeting her to me the right the rest on was caused because it was easter invited him for coffee down at the cuticle
876.9,884.01, for one street and you forget he just went on about one to see the restaurant he wants to see the rest
884.22,889.8, the fates been closed for a few days i have no clue but were walking into
890.1,894.3, obviously made sense that i had to show the guy what recruiting about
895.11,919.47, as i walk in on it was living out to my worth expectations outside you had a hood lamps smoking joints bitches hanging out fighting dogs even the watering bowl for the fighting dog so as the ionian they obviously because they know me from walking by them every day they will say i in a word just return that this was every day life and coming
921.09,929.67, about one half year of an open restaurant in the situation are reading all the reviews had obvious in the first month
929.82,937.47, opening not one did not mention a pick up the story about us opening over restaurant and agitated in going on foes
939.54,944.85, was counted in that boasted they when these guys
946.77,949.95, he walked down the two stars in
949.95,956.7, was the restaurant they were company to make sure that the counteragent
956.82,959.49, that will happen maybe times at
959.91,975.3, why the guests sitting down wondering what the tipping policy 
975.9,977.67, this is
978.09,987.45, she clearly remembers her first the staging with us that night a kid got shot down the street
988.41,991.74, so she was wrapping in the back during some stupid things
992.58,999.48, the body of this guy can running to the back entering with blood on his face blowing his hands as he fools as he for help
1000.08,1003.2, told me recently that she considered no coming back
1003.32,1004.94, just

1022.07,1026.18, that the guy about twenty seven times for but a month ago
1026.87,1033.05, if you are on your way down yes forgeries give a call
1033.5,1040.1, those days we just tried to focus never mind these guys will move on they will leave there's no point of them staying here
1040.34,1043.4, cook food i was proud on from the first day
1043.85,1055.94, we opened up memphis across the street expanding our facilities making impossible for the tubig volumes letting us get high equality produce making more positive traffic on yet forget
1056.33,1058.85, this was on his move though that you could feel
1058.88,1069.59, same way we would feel hostility he would also feel support in people ready to ally themselves with us then you that what we were doing could give a push to the street and make a change
1070.67,1081.41, the comicallest if under her osteopathic program infiltration systems brewing a cup of coffee second to none in companero opening day in august in
1081.83,1088.28, the purifying system that they involved for us to clean the water to use in all tocandeira ions
1088.28,1089.69, the next
1090.17,1096.86, julien had shortly opened their respective polishers in the street and there were parasite playin table well
1097.01,1104.48, then from two stewards opossum of his italian wines completing a windless only featuring nation
1104.9,1110.33, our food would concede street and then the whole city i was certain it
1111.38,1115.61, i knew that if i got through dangerous our financial set up
1116.12,1117.74, liberty in mind
1117.8,1122.24, everybody just leave the knight and the packing cutting board and get the hell out of him
1123.71,1129.32, maurice was ambitions were high and liberty as
1130.01,1135.41, want to take food simply but interestingly leaving people with something to remember
1136.43,1138.65, with a past that no marine
1138.68,1146.06, just what everybody would be ready to call us a normal light there were just spin off some of the new note taffimai cheap
1146.12,1162.17, she restricted ourselves to not do some of those things that so typical for the new no wave of the moment not noma the wave that came after i offer us the example of us acting as teenagers not wanting to look like the parrots
1165.08,1173.54, i don't even over this guy in a full enormous abyssinia
1173.69,1177.98, to be written respectfully anyway but our restaurant was a surprise can get
1178.58,1181.79, would be nothing offensive about me for it
1182.0,1185.09, and i feel closer to nature when i took
1185.24,1186.53, for it
1202.58,1206.45, exaggerated use of his
1206.72,1221.87, the time to pick perfectly of anything we were busy with the people who will make pure out of the herd and focus on their flavour more than esthetics my italian heritage also call for the use of olivia shoves breadcrumbs citric
1222.29,1225.92, a relay is not a addiderant
1227.12,1235.55, these limitations we were on creating an advantage for souls my man oweth the cooking a relay was fundamentally the same as nomos
1236.51,1240.59, the most important difference gave me was to say
1240.59,1243.29, i guess these here with his eyes closed
1243.56,1245.6, i know what he's eating
1246.02,1252.74, exactly what i want people to feel eating a relief that it is unique in its good and its bad
1252.8,1263.66, constrain ourselves to a maximum of three to four components on every dish leaving the food make and powerful we would cut the fruit to the bone in the same way as we did with the restaurant
1263.9,1274.52, keep our cost low and quality high who had focus on vegetables on through the minute offering a vegetarian menu but also keeping the universe man very much based on the green
1274.91,1278.45, well rose carrots with the she reading blackcurrants
1278.51,1283.76, the abigail allison more
1283.94,1296.72, we were a pickle mace servant with colliery thing simple i would any day prefer that i guess what appreciates you of the vicious hate one and be absolutely blown away by the fourth
1296.78,1301.61, more than just eating for fishes the wood make a difference in any way
1302.18,1310.73, just to give you a quick idea of what it really means a people experience the food we do i just gathered up with like a fine of our food on integram
1310.79,1312.11, alack
1312.89,1353.87, i see
1354.53,1359.81, a grotto a lot of those teddy pictures before we got to the food when i was uninteresting for this
1360.74,1367.91, we worked potestate reverence great successes i've been pleased with it estimable
1368.12,1373.94, my opportunity to thank them for believing in me even when one family thinks i was going out
1374.99,1385.07, the 
1385.97,1397.28, reviews were pretty positive even though a few more reviews lost a lot of the points our choice of going all natural on the winds may be challenged them a bit too much back then
1403.79,1411.62, these the great surprise to everyone including ourselves we received a mission in star and short of jumped on to that lion
1412.64,1424.76, extremely successful proving to ourselves the pudding high and food in a more simple easy going in dynamic contact is what people want and what we absolutely love doing
1426.02,1434.93, finding in its classical meaning but not be that quite yet but it is facing extinction my generation will move on
1438.86,1452.93, a great success experience by releasing ourselves from the fine dining sea has inspired friends and former colleagues to do the same at least them seeing us having so much fun watering it must have done something to them
1453.53,1455.27, much more fun now
1458.15,1462.05, as develops incredibly much since the beginning
1462.2,1466.19, being for guy and i do service with minute guys in the kitchen
1467.09,1468.17, the
1471.65,1482.09, to a test catasto laghouat and connection to the kitchen where we can work creatively and impendit from all kinds of people
1482.15,1484.46, the most that they look first on the kitchen
1484.49,1486.23, just focus
1486.65,1500.12, here john time morose and myself were full time a moving on with the minute bringing in the so many balance audacious to challenge us and find the perfect match between my wine and food
1500.12,1504.32, we started to come down to realize what work were doing
1504.71,1513.65, and what really focus on a produce as improved steadily from the one as we gained experience in postures converter and pine
1514.01,1522.47, with the balance away from focusing only in private to activity and letting nature be more creative letting produce the more its own
1523.16,1526.64, i told me recently the after dining with a evange
1528.74,1530.78, getter and better
1531.05,1536.66, focus on a tree for component tish had reduced to say to two and a half
1537.71,1539.66, i criteria
1540.05,1558.29, produce have improved to the point that we some time ago picked up the ambition of being the first again i certified mission a restaurant in the world
1558.38,1559.01, he
1559.31,1562.28, recognition were received this may and we obviously
1562.7,1567.77, with a bare and the rain as a demoralising ideas
1568.25,1584.3, evolution and cooking and our focus on produced machine to her found the new level of maturity it did not have before remember being restless when in new dishes on the menu needs of the time to look produce comfort and the sight went to go on the menu
1584.9,1589.76, be more sensible to every detail as we've been slowly building up on identity
1590.3,1592.58, i've been asking myself why
1592.85,1599.42, the need to slow down trying to understand more annoy but maybe these guys might be a part of the answer
1600.44,1606.98, my father best for i tasted and after cooking it trying it and seeing for the first time it has been a release and memphis many
1607.07,1608.12, and
1608.78,1616.01, between the two restaurants and the thorough planning as giving us the possibility to serve for me the greatest luxury
1616.16,1621.68, possibly find on both sides of the street still keeping up prices just by planning
1622.1,1627.29, i realized that so much for being thought of as the restaurant using only the humblest ingredients
1627.62,1631.04, but the most expensive piece of pork in the plate every day
1631.67,1638.45, the produce at this level as that understand the were taken so many steps since we first started roasting charts
1640.16,1648.35, come time to challenge your own initials ideas initial ideas remind have been right to begin with i think we were
1648.89,1650.87, that make it the only true
1651.89,1654.38, importantly to people get it
1654.41,1661.76, do they understand the work for pulling the seemingly simple vicious does the music really have to be that stretch
1662.48,1664.76, by some speakers may be with it
1666.2,1669.65, keep the music loud but essentially high in quality
1670.37,1674.6, some paper for the rest room that didn't reach leaving were not
1675.89,1678.17, at some point i felt
1678.47,1688.37, but we were almost looking i guess ourselves deliberately and that the monocle and wobbles became furniture the state taking a point foreign that's what we're not wanted
1689.03,1697.79, the tree the quality of the food and the restaurant had grown so much that he started taking focus away from the food in the wine
1704.45,1712.49, we were close on monetarily and we thought we were used the time to let religious
1713.9,1719.45, he was changed into a solid and probe background for the quality he would serve on the plate
1719.93,1724.49, product you do not get higher quality in any other restrain the city
1725.27,1735.38, riches not to base our kitchen and prime cuts the for the cave as a creative restriction does not make us a cheap restaurant restaurant it makes us a different one
1736.16,1749.03, then it comes down to a question of communication will be italy opened i believe that true astronomy could speak its language anywhere and a destitute that i may view here a living proof of the
1749.81,1754.16, to learn that for most of our guests ruinating hand
1754.76,1764.87, most on taste that difference whether we drive the car north to pick up a card from the boat daily assuring a freshness and quality of it just get it through the wholesale several days after
1765.59,1771.98, he stood that we need to communicate these things not only but telling far through long stories at the table
1772.46,1777.95, so by just keeping that same thing red line all over the case experience
1778.16,1784.37, and an interior trying to send the same message as our cooking philosophy really held for with the
1784.88,1788.69, no longer in contrast with a cooking pot in harmony
1789.68,1793.55, experience actually far more august really getting to
