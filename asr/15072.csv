0.03,40.44, thanks crushed morning good evening for join with his vivid many misterton on the campus pastor here at resonate and man is really good to be here i thank you vandals university idaho and sighewash into wild cats mansell sweetly as reladin us the video and you didn't know the first time to be here i love the fact that we are a church it doesn't just meet here but we have five different sides one church barnside kind of spread throughout washington and so it's really sweet to be joined by some other campuses and so a man i'm impalpable next few weeks that we have together 
40.77,57.18, josh and we have a friend a friend who a couple of years ago evermoving us a call and telling us this really outlandish story he travels full time for a living and 
57.27,87.48, some business sense of the evenings i have often so he and that evening just kind of strolls down to the bar and the hotel and he just kind of hanging out and just kind of just killing time and a young lady i'm approaches him and notices different in the south the fellow should always do the approaching and but she approaches him and offers to buy him a drink and for ever as he's like sure why not and this our friend take this drink and the blacks
87.51,107.1, bisco out done and all of a sudden he fast forward he wakes up inside of his hotel room okay i'm a bit confused a little day over what has happened and as he starts to put the pieces together rosino actually in his bed he's actually in the bath
107.13,115.29, i'm completely covered with ice and right next to him there's a sign that says don't move just call on one one
115.35,137.16, and so he and with his hand shaky because it how cold it is riches for the phone calls in one one and begins to explain what has what's going on and the lady on the other line is strangely calm and strangely familiar with this story and so she began to go he sir would you just reach behind to me favour and can you fill a tub coming out of your lower back
137.28,162.63, he does just that and she says gaetano the ambulance there on their way to you as amenothes began to explain that he was the first another he was later on in many cases of organist would go to these bars they would see a pretty woman with a drink with drugs with black amount they would remove their kidney or some other organ and in sellon the black market now
162.93,223.41, you probably heard that story before and that's because it's not real it's what we call an urban legend and so we've got one o the things just happen you like his brother is making this up for me at istory it's real it's an urban legend why do we have urbanity the thessians dougallians don't take drinks from strangers no matter how pretty they are or it could be he don't make out with your boy friend on the top of a hill islesmen with a hook may try to kill you like
223.62,246.96, when i cited about to day and after the next few weeks it is we're not going to look at stories of fiction are going to dive into the old testament and some just man legendary stories and epic perforce a larger than life stories that are going to allow us to see a bit of god's character
247.47,253.74, allow us to see something that may be normally we wouldn't see because we didn't have ears to hear or would have eyes to see
253.77,258.48, and so though the stories are true these are real life stories
258.57,259.89, there
259.98,302.22, we dived into this series of ledges and very serious i hope the god would give us these fresh a fresh sense like a obscuring his word of abusing what he's doing some prefontaine and mercantile into it so father think so much for our church and thank you so much that were willing to dive into some really hard text and then and really obscure text if a aprecor for myself in this moment how would you just speak through me and i don't i don't want to get up here and just say a bunch of random stuff or try to convince your people if something to be true on got i realize that only you can do that
302.55,305.43, a spirit of gogebic in this room
306.09,311.28, so evident for us a presentable how close you are thus
311.43,313.53, you speak to us
313.98,325.71, this is huge story we see how it applies to our lives and we reminded of who you are and may that push us to redemption and loves amerian
325.77,330.33, well as a culture and large we love
330.39,334.23, love like we love to love
334.29,380.4, love but we love it you know what i'm saying but like for example is not i don't know i really believe that like most of us spend our waking day and even our dream stay dreaming about love and maybe that that magical moment where we meet that person or catastrophes that mordaunt person we love it like into if you not look at stalk at our culture and box office sails over half a billion dollars a year is spent on romantic comedies
380.4,393.3, if you valentine this year alone federate two thousand fourteen and those that you the days leading up to valentine's day eighteen point six billion dollars
393.6,394.62, spent
394.74,401.67, valentine's ah wethalie chalk candies or cards or whatever
401.79,409.59, a lot of money that ten billion dollars and sails just a romantic novels alone
409.83,434.64, novels a year written from antinomian does not romantic novels they used the poles at seventy four million americans a last year readily one romantic novel i don't know who these people are i don't know where you find them but they exist they ah but as a culture at large and we love love
435.15,437.43, love love songs
437.52,450.09, i love but is all you need betasseled thing such was love to love love but the question i want to ask us this morning
450.15,451.68, is 
451.68,453.54, what is that
453.87,470.88, and what is it all about and what is it even man because if you think about it we use the word pretty pretty flatly like igloo at my mom and nothing out with my parents in limestone got off the phone mulvey
471.12,476.64, a canoe is said jane i love you
477.0,479.79, now are those the same
480.6,486.03, in some ways but in a lot of ways it's not i and if it was
486.3,496.71, that's creepy okay there different i love my mom and i a love my wife but you know what else i love coffee
496.74,502.56, you know elsie french fries i absolutely love piazza
502.62,506.1, so so we mean by love
506.34,515.07, even man and i think that it caused a bit of confusion or culture we began to go in a lot of ways we worship it we love it
515.94,545.07, i know what it is and we don't really have a great illustration of what it means to be loved if you have your bibles and i want you to turn to a book called up because now it was going say this most of you foetus to repose at a taine those took me lilimond it so it was just all go in ever broletto the table of contents and let's just go ahead and find it there so that what you don't feel insecure it not weird for you it's not three forces of the way through the old testament whose is kind of like it like
545.19,562.62, it right in there scratchard to see it was you turn if you've had a bottle for a long time this is the part of your bible that's like iron straight if i really claim to this never been open and soothing
562.77,605.73, i mean this as a book is written to the israelites and there's italicizing okay for themselves like living comfortably they've got it together and much like us they love the idea of love but the problem is instead of man wrapping them in around three love that kind of trade that and for a philosophy which is an idea of love really kind of bouterie areas and check this out israel number one on the philosophies that they had about love is real believe that love could be purchased that if you have no money if you if you got it i like waif you're ready enough then in the the people going to love you but that that's what they believed
605.85,606.99, two
607.35,612.96, i believe that love is simply the pursuit of self gratification
614.01,621.06, if you love it and it's so canlon is really all about you and what makes you you feel good that's what love is
621.57,627.87, three one of the philosophies israel believed that love could be found and in animated objects
627.93,629.4, things
629.64,630.9, stuff
631.02,632.82, there's a deal
634.08,635.31, the sounds
635.31,636.96, familiar
639.24,642.72, this doesn't seem really far fetched for us
642.87,673.38, in that week with me we really do as you look at a culture if you look at our magazines if you look at our art shows if you look at our movies the person has the most stuff as the most likes going to gain love if you have a nice enough cock then you're going to be loved if you're pretty enough if you can buy the best cause medics or getting basterga you're going to be loved more asadero our culture is everywhere not only that it's all about us it's all about what whitelees me what makes me happy and so if you make me happy i therefore love you if you don't make me happy
674.55,676.38, see later
677.25,684.48, a number hesitate really do believe at times that we could find love and just stuff
686.01,695.64, wise man we would not break our backs and our pocket books to get things but away outside of our pay grade isom how satisfy us and complete us
696.45,698.73, so i tell you that
699.51,706.02, we're not too far in this book isn't out dated as not just out there in leffie
707.22,715.95, think that god has something really important he wants to say to us to day and i want to hear it and i want to say but i connect the dots
716.52,728.07, so looking at would say he set the kind of set the stage for you with chapters on through to the seven hundred and fifty years before jesus ever shows up on the same
729.3,751.17, god has way of selecting men profits to be his mouthpiece the voice to a people so it would pull a profit adawlut you to say this to my people and they would relay that message and so whose they are holy man a pastorate popular prominent man in this culture
751.77,755.31, given a message but not only is he given a message
755.31,767.34, and he's given an assignment much like most profits would giving had believed that i see is given great outlandish craziest simon and of any of the prophets
767.43,772.68, god shows up to house possesses a deal broth
773.52,777.66, yes your silent if you choose to take it
777.96,781.74, i want you to marry
782.67,784.14, prostitute
786.48,799.77, say what come again so god the have it your bud and i i totally misunderstood you i got a sworn that you just said i was to marry yet you heard right
800.49,804.99, want you that go and i want you to marry a prostitute
806.37,812.91, the bible doesn't give us too much i mean just like guided it
812.97,816.81, just faith foreseeing as i negotiate name
817.95,819.15, or
819.9,828.93, may she must have really been loved as a kid a sounds supurative can't wait to meet her gomer
831.15,832.92, a faithful
833.94,838.77, leave his house and he goes and he finds gomer
838.83,842.04, he begins to pursue her and woo her
842.22,847.17, after an i can only speculate what those interactions would have been like
847.71,852.51, that would have been actually paying money to abilities with her
852.6,855.69, look at her go had listened on another for that
856.05,857.55, i just want to get to know you
857.97,872.04, a conversation with her when i hear about your heart and not eventually somehow over time he woos her and persuade her to leave a life of prostitution and come with him
872.13,873.39, marry him
874.89,877.17, i cannot even begin to imagine
877.23,878.91, hard that would be
880.05,890.49, a man that is a given his whole life to pursue the things of god i mean has walked in purity and god look and say i want you to marry this prostitute as woman's going to be unfaithful to you
893.55,897.51, sylvester and the things are going kaffirs
897.57,901.02, years not too bad i got three kids
902.1,905.73, all of a sudden one day as he wakes up
906.6,908.31, nowhere to be found
910.2,924.3, not next him in bed as you look through the house she is nowhere to be found is not outside noisier than all the sudden he realises that she straight up bounded and went back to her life of prostitution
925.2,926.31, hear me
928.44,930.51, been married only six months
931.26,934.38, no means whatsoever to have it figured out
935.37,977.88, i cannot even begin to wrap around i ran up mine my head around what that would have felt like to have been after at this woman that you have pursued with your life to you given everything that you may be promised that everything is mannering to the table you've been so unfaithful i give everything to you i built a family with you a home with you my atomized my life to you and i she straight up stabs him in the back and leave like the heart the pain i can't came in at my mind around it and here's the deal with some of us in this room then this isn't it's not too far fetched for us some of us we've lived in this out we know too well what it feels like
978.03,979.47, abandoned
979.53,983.31, heart broken to have some walk out on us
985.2,990.75, we have an experienced personally some of us have a front row seats of watching it play out
992.97,996.48, cannot even begin to rain around it
998.19,1005.21, i employ my mind like what it would have been like if i would have it the chance to see her and what would i say
1006.14,1021.35, i handle this situation may i would let her have i let her know how much she's hurt me a little now how wrong she was and handsome way it is belike find you give what you deserve if they prostitutions what you want it's all yours
1021.77,1023.87, your life you've chosen that
1025.58,1028.97, god comes to jose and he has a different plan
1030.14,1032.0, you to see this and burst
1032.18,1033.8, chapter three per one
1037.34,1044.18, say chapter three verse one says this is this is what god tells hotheaded how to respond
1045.44,1048.08, and the lord said to me speaking of those
1048.92,1056.42, and love your wife again even though she commits adultery with another lover
1057.2,1080.45, go and love your wife again even though she commits adultery with another lover this will illustrate that the lord still loves israel even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship then god comes to jose and goes listen i see you in your despair i see you in your heart break and here at a point you to do go and get her
1081.02,1085.43, you got to be kidding me
1088.85,1090.68, did what she did
1095.69,1096.56, the
1098.15,1099.83, with that like
1101.6,1106.31, holman is past her leaving once again his home
1106.73,1109.07, into the red light district
1109.76,1112.49, in himself right in the heart beat
1112.55,1114.86, of the sex side industry
1118.13,1123.02, walking up to different people going through brother amasa
1123.53,1124.88, a wife
1125.27,1129.95, maybe having interactions with men that i actually slept with his wife
1130.49,1131.9, i say
1133.37,1136.1, all of a sudden as the round a corner
1137.27,1138.29, she
1139.91,1144.41, he's not on the corner all dressed up all doubling herself
1145.7,1147.32, on the auction block
1148.43,1150.23, so he is better
1151.25,1158.6, other two reasons that a slave was auctioned off the one the tempest had no use for them any more
1159.77,1161.09, tired of them
1162.56,1166.61, he wore nothing were no good for us get rid of him
1168.26,1174.74, say that more than likely she was completely naked because buyers would want to know what they were paying for
1176.42,1179.51, and all her shame
1180.05,1188.81, all of her guilt there completely naked in front of a row of men that are that are bidding for her
1189.44,1191.9, and walks of a
1194.51,1208.76, and in that moment imagining looking at her going that's not nessie like that that that the snowflakes wife that's my wife and the ochterlony said listen listen brissot care who you think she is
1209.15,1210.44, she's for sale
1212.63,1220.04, look at what was heads look at what he has to audacity to do in verse to
1221.42,1222.71, so
1222.89,1224.78, but her back
1224.81,1230.72, pieces of silver and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine
1233.93,1256.67, i love to think the romantic comedy verges of this would be that their walks in and gory light up and she is just manorite that there corsairs here to like take care of a rescuer hero but the truth is i think more and more than likely there's that moment of shame when she looks and goes man of all the people here he still last person on a sea
1258.62,1269.27, he's here to tell me i told you so i mean this the last person why am why here why now and that he has oddment
1273.26,1274.82, pieces of silver
1276.86,1286.1, pieces of silver fifteen pieces of silver or less not enough and let me liquidate my assets
1286.88,1290.48, i can buy back what is all ready in
1293.45,1294.59, then
1296.39,1299.09, absolutely in love with this woman
1300.68,1302.78, a great price
1303.44,1306.77, rescue back what is already his
1307.94,1309.29, i do it
1311.06,1313.49, every right to just say 
1313.7,1315.23, forget this
1315.68,1317.39, my love
1317.39,1327.14, he did in as you're not not not not your best state not looking grave and clean yourself up and come to me and even say you're sorry
1329.39,1330.8, this
1332.03,1334.73, answers in verse three and fought through five
1337.97,1339.56, then i said to her
1340.1,1341.84, speaking
1342.35,1384.11, you must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution during this time you will not have sexual lations with any one not even me and this shows that israel will go a long time without a king or prince and without sacrifices sacred pillars priest and even idle but afterward the people we return and devote themselves to the lord their god and to david their king and the last day it were tremendous his goodness why in the world has got as whoever a prostitute knowing that she's going to be unfaithful and then ultimately sent him to chase after her here's one
1386.87,1388.16, god
1388.28,1391.94, it is riding a legendary love story
1392.72,1401.51, and he realizes that you and i would never fully understand his love for you and us if you just told us
1402.77,1405.98, an epic display god man
1406.04,1409.73, but his love in full display for us to see
1412.01,1417.74, god's goin to look at us and say listen my love for you is just like that
1417.8,1462.89, and the language here even a verse three is the linking these are wedding vows i koshare her he redeemed her miniaan him putting this to around her and walking her out all of her shame all of her guilt and just waiting for her at camberton hit me he's going to hesitating her out takes her home and then he gives wedding vows again he like it like a first day skerstymone a doting and all love you and then i'll incomplete you an all all answering response no he say listen no matter what you do a matter how far you run
1463.52,1465.8, pursue you have a chase you
1467.18,1472.61, got an that's the exact same image of my love for my people
1474.86,1479.72, i want to know what it really looks like he lay it out for us
1480.8,1488.6, he realizes that we would never fully understand how much we've heard him and how much it cost him
1492.95,1497.66, i did it's easy to kind of walk into a room and if this is the be
1497.75,1498.74, been
1498.77,1507.02, to church for a little bit the idea of god's love on love you is if we're not careful it can be very under whelming
1508.61,1510.53, who got loose
1511.43,1517.61, he has the longitudes love and i guess he has to love me he just doesn't let me not god cried
1518.09,1522.29, we see the song true we know we know all about it
1524.39,1528.83, we don't really believe that god actually loves you
1529.61,1531.71, only that he loves you
1532.7,1534.05, like 
1535.22,1539.3, you are at the object of his affection
1540.86,1545.57, chases after you pursues you loves you
1546.26,1549.47, even in the midst of our one faithfulness
1552.17,1553.52, his 
1555.83,1558.05, amazing picture
1559.97,1577.94, think a lot since we come in the streamlike mandatory story i can't wait to find me a girl and be a hosier and so some awesome owercome in the relief man tom scope in an open asesino somewhere to see her she
1581.72,1583.31, problem is
1584.78,1586.79, not to say the story
1588.02,1589.16, or the game
1597.26,1599.3, to pursue us
1599.48,1642.17, chases after i remember then thinking one time when i was in college i was like driving in watching the sun rises only one awake in my car is road trip and just men and is felt like the lowest going through listeners how much i love you in pursuing you i wooing you with a sun rise as it is though i was the only one that saw it that day it's not true but if i felt like it was like speaking to my heart like i love you in pursuing you i see when you're so unfaithful even when you cross the to yourself when you parleyers you for yourself out to so many things less wild than metatarse you have loved you have brought you in i've offered everything i provided everything for you but you keep a running to all these other gods thinking that somehow they will satisfy you if you sell yourself to them
1646.34,1648.74, and does out some heart breaks
1649.73,1656.09, but i think we get that i think i think most of us in this room and go to it i told her that i fly with that
1658.13,1665.33, somehow that life would prostitution keeps us from actually knowing that god loves us and living in a god loves us
1666.05,1667.64, so i keep returning
1669.47,1674.57, keep running to those things because we don't really believe that he loves us
1677.21,1684.89, really feel as though he he cares for that has his unfailing unmatured entangle for you
1690.23,1691.7, i mean college
1692.51,1695.3, two years into my walk with his
1695.51,1700.07, and i had one of those moments in isabel like epic failure
1700.82,1706.82, felt like i just like cross that line and to like there it is crushed work for me
1708.62,1710.87, you can never
1711.62,1713.48, you can never welcome me back
1713.75,1714.59, one
1716.0,1728.9, a moment just in such shame i remember my roommate who just loved jesus so much so passionate me down an look me if i just across a listen cross table said drew and netta hear this and to understand this statement
1730.34,1740.57, that there is nothing that you will ever ever do that will ever make god love you less than what he loves you right now
1740.96,1778.16, and there is nothing that you will ever do that will make god love you more there's nothing that you can do that i will make god love you less than what he loves you now there's nothing that you can do that would allow them to love you more and here he was my view of god i thought that if i just performed well enough if i would just good enough i just satisfy him if i just didn't cuss his much only when the jokes are really funny if i didn't sleep around if i didn't drink if i didn't do do do do think god would love me and then he would lie welcomes proud of me that is a way grew up at some parents were just like attach that to god
1779.6,1783.71, i've gone too far i was like that it magazine going to be polani guess i'm done
1786.05,1789.44, someone look at me and go listen god's love doesn't
1789.71,1790.7, that
1793.04,1795.26, you can't run too far
1795.74,1798.71, you don't know what i've been through
1798.86,1801.29, breslau shame and guilt
1801.65,1807.65, talk of shame is far too like it's like not like a distant thing in the passage just a little too close
1808.16,1823.04, but look if you knew the things i've been looking at on my computer last night you go listen to god can't love me though that if you knew what i had done with him this passato ship or how far of god or that if you knew all the skeletons in my case
1824.18,1825.89, the god came up 
1828.23,1831.83, and god paints his picture of gomer
1833.42,1834.89, you haven't gone that far
1837.2,1845.87, on that far and i love her pursue her chase after her i will never give up on her
1850.25,1853.04, and it's not because of how she acted
1854.87,1870.56, she didn't clean herself up it and herself a lot of times people at the good church for gonostoma night i after go to church or like some out equalising a race all mistakes about pray this many prayers belisent these songs or but talk to some i think got a race my son
1870.68,1874.85, but then there was nothing lovable about guerin that moment
1875.9,1879.05, only thing that made her lovable was the fact
1879.38,1880.76, love her
1881.6,1885.29, i see them moving beauty and the beast a club big disney fan
1885.5,1890.36, oh i'm i'm i'm secure a man i guess say that okay
1891.29,1892.73, the beast
1893.09,1895.49, nothing about him as lovable
1896.69,1898.91, no redemptive qualities in him
1900.38,1905.72, only the fact that they are beauty chooses to love the beast
1906.29,1908.81, begins to them make him lovable
1909.17,1910.88, then transformed him
1912.44,1914.24, the same is true for you and i
1915.44,1917.24, clean ourselves up
1918.65,1925.31, we don't put perfuming and put on a really pretty dress and try to come back to gottofrey sorry i blew it
1927.68,1932.33, it's the fact that god loves you that makes you lovable
1932.84,1934.52, that's what transforms you
1936.74,1938.63, i believe it
1941.6,1943.94, i think that says a lot about you
1945.02,1948.44, i think that our life style and of
1949.22,1952.91, rats out over her not we really truly believe that god loves his
1954.59,1956.42, shapes who we are
1958.25,1962.39, we don't change our behavior so they got a love as but because he loved
1962.93,1964.31, change is
1968.45,1970.34, this last named
1970.43,1981.29, and talking to to josh about a kind of this his whole idea and tempted the rest and can remind around it 
1981.41,1998.96, o joses favorite heroes of the faith has got in richmond had his life changes a singer songs life changed at the bad by relationship with a gangrenous passera book called ragamuffin gospel incredible book i i if things that you hear me say this morning like a stone
1999.14,2001.81, by into that it's a great red
2002.62,2009.58, manoel the rich heard and desert from from a sermon he gave
2010.0,2018.22, all highlights society that when the most important things about you and you get face to face with the god of the universe
2018.61,2024.13, when you realize that he talks about king david here he never was dead
2025.3,2032.44, the prophecy of a king that would come in the lineage meaning that would come in the line of king david
2032.89,2034.48, talk about jesus
2035.23,2048.28, jesus left his home walked into the red light district and bought us back with his life he said when you understand it when you stand before jesus the question he's goin to ask ye must important question is did you believe that i love you
2049.36,2050.92, i believe it
2052.15,2055.39, i read a kind of closing
2057.49,2058.69, it is where
2059.68,2065.05, and the forty eight years since i was first ambushed by jesus
2065.32,2077.41, a little chapel in the mountains of western pennsylvania and i literally thousands of hours of prayers meditation silent solitude over those years i am now utterly convinced that on judgment day
2077.89,2082.9, the lord jesus is going to ask each one of us one question and only one question
2083.86,2085.81, and you believe that i love you
2086.8,2088.27, i desire to
2088.96,2094.78, and for you day after day that i long to hear the sound of your voice
2095.44,2096.97, believers there
2100.03,2105.67, i believed in your love and i tried to shape my life as a response to it
2106.72,2108.01, many of us
2108.58,2114.61, so faithful and our ministry or practice or church going we're going to have to reply
2114.94,2117.01, frankly no sir
2117.58,2126.73, i mean i never really believed it i mean i heard i heard a lot of sermons about a lot of teachings about it like i even gave some myself
2127.12,2134.26, but i always thought that was just a way of speaking a kindly lie some christians pious pat on the back to cheer me on
2135.04,2141.82, there's the difference between the real believers and the nominal christians that are found in our churches across the land
2142.75,2158.89, no one can measure like a believer the depth and the intensity of god's love but at the same time no one can measure like a believer the effectiveness of our gloom pessimism low self esteem self hatred and despair that block god's way to us
2159.7,2163.81, why it's so important to lay hold of this basic truth of our faith
2164.32,2167.89, only going to be as big as your own concept of god
2168.82,2173.41, goes on to say this remember the famous line from the french philosopher pascal
2173.77,2176.2, a man in his own image
2176.23,2178.24, the man returned the compliment
2179.05,2187.72, god our own image and winds up to be a fussy rude narrow minded legalistic judgmental unforgiving and unloving as we are
2189.07,2193.45, as the past couple of years of treats the gospel all over the world
2193.57,2199.15, honest to god the god of so many christians i meet is a god who is too small for me
2200.26,2202.12, is not the god of the word
2202.54,2210.31, is not the god revealed by and does christ who at this moment comes right to you at your seat and says this
2210.73,2212.83, have a word for you
2213.52,2231.94, i know your whole life story of every skeleton in your closet and every moment of sin shame dishonesty to greater love that is dark in your past and right now i know your shallow faith your feeble prayer life your inconsistent discipleship and my word is this
2233.5,2235.39, the trust that i love you
2236.44,2237.67, as you are
2238.54,2239.92, not as you should be
2241.03,2243.91, you're never going to be as you should be
2251.26,2253.24, there that
2255.16,2258.43, god really is absolutely infatuated with you
2259.84,2269.71, a life for you at you could have a deep interrelationship with you he bought that was already his the scripture of man is springall of creation his
2270.34,2272.17, already his
2273.07,2275.11, pursued into back
2276.34,2277.93, there to live in that
2278.71,2279.91, for 
2289.84,2291.7, father 
2293.59,2303.58, and then we have a tin that see to walk into this room and just behold lion notice whole back and not fully believe on that you love us
2304.03,2310.06, you died for so you have a plan for us i don't live in that case honesdale it
2311.08,2320.17, think we say it i think we mention it i think we hear about it we even get teetotal about your love but follow don't live in 
2321.31,2332.05, god may we dare to be people that really do understand that you love us that you gave your life for us and that then we can respond in obedience because of your love
2333.07,2337.72, to gain your obedience but because you love as we pray for resonator
2338.26,2339.88, get that
2341.2,2355.18, i may be experience is a little bit of you this morning and realizing that he and you gave her everything everything that we could have this relationship so often we run back to a lover so less wild
2356.56,2360.82, the next few moments we worship the giving stewardship the song
2361.12,2362.89, we not pull back
2363.55,2377.53, and capture or heart may it maniples in a full surrender may we element who you are and what you've done and my father us remembering what you began may redeem who we are
2378.25,2387.34, and we take it to the world i pray that for a church credit would get it i pray this is an acute sermon about love
2387.79,2391.51, the father here is
2391.75,2396.55, hear from your heart sooner
