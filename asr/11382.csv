105.81,108.99, one of the areas of responsibility for

184.56,193.77, when sin reported the story they managed to spin the wording of the story to make it appear somehow that trump or trump supporters were both
193.89,196.17, somehow responsible for these anti
196.38,197.97, it attacks
198.24,205.35, even though my trump as we've said before has a daughter married to an orthodox jew and his grandchildren are being raised
205.53,212.16, orthodox jews a heterosexual couple in england of lost an appeal in court
212.37,213.6, to
213.72,216.0, granted a civil partnership
217.65,229.71, she and the other foot story rebecca steinfeld and charles cabin from hammersmith that's west london have argued that the yuk government's position on civil partnerships is incompatible with equality law
229.95,235.98, three judges or heard the case rejected their argument and said they could just get married
236.22,244.02, civil partnership act in the k was passed in provided legal rights property and pensions to
244.02,246.27, people of the same sex
247.32,257.19, it was passed of course after gay rights campaigners demanded legal recognition for same sex couples and then in in the same sex marriage was legalized
257.7,258.96, they can still
259.65,263.1, they can still join together in a civil partnership
263.49,265.38, heterosexual couples
266.37,275.01, case may be appealed and we shall see what happens speaking of the k a suicide bomber for the islamic state
275.43,279.9, it is been disclosed was released
280.11,285.54, i had four from guantanamo bay
285.78,297.6, a campaign by the british press the gentleman born old fiddler had changed his name to jamadar
297.81,306.45, and he was paid one million dollars about a million pounds by the uk government is compensation after his release
308.13,309.6, a million and a quarter
309.78,311.13, yer money
312.12,313.71, he took two
316.32,324.15, blow himself up and took a number of people with him this information coming out now as tony blair appears to be
324.15,337.05, to make a political come back and this of course would be very embarrassing because this happened on players watch in the us businesses are placing their names on a growing nationalist of sanctuary restaurants
338.01,341.49, the website behind the campaign these sanctuary restaurants
341.67,362.13, this means that these restaurants have zero tolerance for sex is racism and xenophobia and the motto we believe there is a place at the table for everyone is kind of a line with a whole sanctuary city movement around the country city leaders around the country expressing opposition to president trumps immigration
362.28,373.17, or is proposed immigration banths is not a legal designation calling yourself your business sanctuary restaurant does not give anyone any
373.35,380.4, safety from ice immigration and customs enforcement or local law enforcement
381.66,388.5, people participating are being asked to put a sign on their window promoting the movement which of course then let everybody who
388.62,391.08, support the president also know that
391.14,401.04, where this group stands this organization this restaurant stands they're claiming that this is not a political movement that it is simply a message of
401.4,406.74, of their mission to treat every customer and employed with dignity and respect
408.0,417.06, course it's a political movement it is nothing but a political movement its virtue signaling and posturing is what it is
417.42,425.37, certainly welcome to do it it's a free country you see on the map or locations of sanctuary restaurants around the country
426.57,434.97, not yet here in our home state of missouri wouldn't be surprised to see some pop up we've got a couple of major universities here that tend to be a little left of center but
435.27,439.08, nothing but a political statement and
439.29,459.39, string and in massachusetts a police department there is scrapped their high five friday programme this is a program in which local police officers would greet children as they entered school on a friday morning give them a high five why has the northampton massachusetts police department stopped the program
459.42,470.19, some parents complained that a police presence at the child's school make children specifically in importing from the article clerks of color or immigrant children
470.58,471.87, uncomfortable
476.25,478.89, presented without comment
480.57,482.19, so we really
482.67,486.45, really tried not to deal with and
486.72,530.55, and how you can win free copies of the new books by dr michael hyer and your surly straight ahead on scatch you have been fighting and a war against an enemy you've been told doesn't even exist sky watch t v wants to change that to prepare you for the battles ahead beginning march seventh exclusively from sky watch t v the cause macaroon finally arrived featuring three ground breaking books a five hour day deep and a seven hour audio series showing you how real the supernatural war of kingdoms actually is reversing her on by a claimed bible and ancient language scholar doctor michael as his and the great inception by sky watched t v derrick p gilbert

619.32,623.46, we really really tried not to
623.55,635.1, address this story it's got watched t frankly in our opinion it's divisive and it's a distraction but it is gone mainstream over the past week and be all star hiring
635.1,646.23, stated his support for the position that the earth is flat and so being reported in the main stream we discussed this yesterday and felt
646.35,657.03, it was time to at least express our opinion on this particular story we have received a number of emails over the two years that we've been broadcasting asking us to address the flat earth issue
657.45,661.23, again we avoided it because frankly it is
661.5,663.45, distraction
663.48,664.86, because
664.89,666.63, observably untrue
667.74,678.84, now i am under no illusions that what i say in the next few minutes will change the minds of anybody who is already convinced that the earth is a disk instead of a globe
679.29,683.61, but we'll present just a couple of ideas here first of all
684.6,686.4, a flat earth model
686.7,713.64, the sun and the moon must be in the sky twenty four hours a day which you see behind me on the screen here is a representation of how the people of the ancient world viewed the earth and its relationship to the heavens the sky and shale and the abyss or carteret below that and this is represented in descriptions in the bible and that's where members of the flatters community draw their
715.02,716.13, support
716.31,718.05, for their beliefs
719.79,720.84, just
721.02,722.52, say this the bible
723.15,733.59, often uses figurative language in a variety of ways poetic language metaphor allegory simile anthropomorphism
733.74,740.1, in order to illustrate a point god revealed himself to people of the ancient world
740.25,742.98, and remember that the bible began to be
742.98,746.49, written down around the fifteenth century b c
746.55,751.29, we accepted moses as the earliest author of the books of the bible
751.5,758.94, starting in the mid th century b c and god revealed himself in terms that men and women of that age
759.03,760.2, understand
760.41,769.92, did not impose on them the burden of understanding twenty first century astrophysics as a precondition for hearing
770.94,771.96, law
772.29,773.52, then the gospel
774.33,783.06, he revealed himself to them in ways they could understand otherwise revealing himself in that day and age would have made no sense whatsoever
783.96,789.0, the words if they needed a twenty per century understanding of astrophysics
789.36,790.59, geology
792.12,795.78, accept the gospel god would not have revealed himself and all
795.96,797.67, until our day
800.16,805.11, to read the bible well let me just a couple of problems with the model
805.98,807.63, because the earth is flat
808.38,811.83, in fact that is the case the sun and the moon would never
812.04,815.46, on they'd have to be in the sky hours a day
816.18,822.21, and everything is going to tell you i should point out proponents of the flatters model have answer for
822.6,826.44, and that's why i'm convinced that i will not change any one's mind here
826.5,829.14, i've not yet heard a logical
829.5,831.54, observable explanation
831.96,836.04, for the few things i'm going to bring up here the sun the moon would never leave the sky
836.04,838.68, would never drop a little the rise and they couldn't because
838.8,842.01, always daylight somewhere on planter
842.82,845.13, it's noon here in missouri it is
846.6,847.86, somewhere in asia
848.7,849.84, vice versa
850.92,856.53, flatterers will say that this because the sun and the moon shine their light
856.71,857.85, a spotlight
858.36,861.57, so when it's you're not below the scope of the beam
864.63,866.43, that's observably untrue
867.27,876.75, because i presume you've seen a search like at night you know grand opening of some new business or a carnival is in town or something and you can see the beam of the searchlight
876.87,879.75, you're not directly over the bean you can see it from the side
879.93,883.35, a tightly focused beam of light a laser
883.47,886.29, visible from the side
887.82,892.77, additionally the in order for the
893.4,898.26, shadow the differences in shadows that are observed at different points on the earth at the same time a day
899.07,900.24, the same
900.6,903.12, longitude but a different latitude
903.72,911.16, a different shadow on the same size same length stick this is how the greek scientist eratosthenes
912.78,921.42, of years before jesus was able to calculate roughly calculate and fairly accurately the diameter of the earth by observing the difference in the length of shadows cast by
922.02,925.08, sticks of the same length at the same time a day
925.08,932.34, now the latter explanation is that the sun and the moon are only thirty two miles in diameter and about three thousand miles above the earth
933.63,939.6, information would also produce the same result here on the earth but if that were true
940.47,942.96, then as the earth
943.17,946.02, the sun and moon revolved around the firmament
946.05,948.75, above the distant earth
949.5,950.97, we would see
950.97,958.02, the size of the sun and the moon change as they grew nearer and then you know grow as they grew near and then
958.62,963.03, smaller they passed away and the speed at which they moved would apparently change
963.51,976.17, we would appear to get faster as it that closer to us and then it passed directly overhead and then it would appear to slow down as move further away just as a car at distance on the highway moving at sixty miles an hour appears to move more slowly
976.5,977.55, the car
977.55,984.33, the highway when you're standing on the shoulder the passage you we do not observe that
985.08,992.16, it is observable untrue the moon as a traveled around the fort would present different sides of itself
992.76,994.29, different parts of the world
995.64,1002.21, we north america would see one side of the moon while people that asia would see the other side of the room again observably
1005.18,1009.77, there are other things a gravity for example doesn't work on the disk
1009.8,1020.24, we understand gravity as you moved closer to the edge of the disk gravity would point back toward the center of the disc so that by the time you got the edge gravity would be pulling at a degree angle to the surface of the earth
1020.27,1031.91, proponents of the flatters model suggests that gravity doesn't work like that that our understanding or gravity is fundamentally flawed and that we're all held to the ground because the earth is accelerating upward at emerson
1033.53,1035.15, curate of the earth
1035.48,1051.5, oftentimes you'll hear proponents of the flatters model say that engineers and surveyors don't calculate for curvature the earth that again is observably untrue the brisoners bridge between brooklyn and staten island about an inch and five eighths that the tower had hold up about an inch and five eighths
1052.07,1055.46, more distance farther apart at the top and they are at the base
1055.64,1061.97, for the curvature of the earth the laser it vermeer gravitation wave observatory lido
1062.33,1064.46, california
1064.64,1070.64, for kilometer of the tube through which they have to shoot a layer there is one matter drop
1070.85,1076.19, about three foot four inches over the four kilometers so again it's observably
1076.28,1084.68, i would also suggest that the photographs of colonel jeffrey williams retired nasa astern who was an outspoken christian
1084.95,1098.48, creationist financial supporter of the institute for creation research who has published a book of photographs that he has taken during his hundreds of days in space in fact he spent a cumulative total of nearly two years in space
1098.54,1102.59, all of the images that he's taken up the earth from the international space station show
1103.28,1104.21, globe
1106.73,1110.96, popinot florimel because this is a direct challenge
1111.59,1113.81, the understanding of the bible
1114.98,1117.92, coming from a man who was an outspoken
1118.34,1123.44, believing christian believes that the earth was created by god
1123.77,1125.72, described in the bible
1126.38,1130.79, puts his money where his mouth was by supporting the institute for creation research
1130.91,1132.35, must be lying
1133.7,1142.34, because you worked for asa asa is evil and therefore he with no more evidence than that this is an example of circular reasoning
1142.37,1144.35, start with the conclusion that
1144.62,1150.56, is evil so he must be lying therefore all of us evidence is disqualified with no more evidence that he is
1151.16,1152.54, being deceitful
1152.57,1155.54, they start with the conclusion that it must be untrue
1156.68,1159.95, rather than letting the evidence be for itself well
1160.13,1163.7, we wouldn't have spent any time on this at all because
1164.21,1167.78, the grand scheme of things as we said this is a distraction
1167.84,1169.4, non essential
1169.58,1170.75, certainly
1170.96,1173.27, certainly do not question
1173.45,1177.14, belief of the sincerity of those who believe in a flat earth
1177.47,1180.35, who profess to be believers in jesus christ
1181.97,1183.02, safe
1183.56,1186.86, confess her sins and confess him as lord and savior
1187.04,1191.66, we're not questioning the sincerity or their salvation
1192.5,1195.65, there are some who will make this a test of orthodoxy
1195.86,1201.44, contend that those of us who accept that the earth is in fact a globe
1202.43,1204.41, don't believe in the bible
1204.53,1205.7, and therefore
1206.09,1209.87, rejecting the word of god and that is absolutely
1210.02,1211.04, false
1211.7,1214.61, god reveals himself to man
1215.0,1216.38, in a manner that
1216.38,1223.1, we were able to understand thirty five hundred years ago three thousand years ago two thousand years ago
1224.54,1226.13, not done so
1226.88,1232.46, would have thought his profits were even crazier than they already thought they were
1233.06,1235.58, please if you choose to believe in a letter
1235.64,1237.68, every now ill will
1238.85,1250.31, we are not questioning your salvation we are not questioning your sanity we are not questioning your reason or your logic okay you're free to believe as you choose to believe but please do not make this issue
1250.91,1253.01, reason to divide
1253.82,1255.59, the body of christ
1255.86,1257.81, too many of those already
1258.29,1259.91, timing of the rapture
1260.27,1262.34, translation of the bible
1262.82,1265.01, now the flatters
1265.85,1270.56, spirit of division is not from god so please consider
1270.71,1271.61, well
1271.76,1275.09, how you deal with this particular issue
1275.93,1280.4, just wanted to know where we isolated b stand and why we have not to this point addressed it
