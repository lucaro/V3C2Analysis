20.07,64.86, in our world of information capital and global empire biometric control has emerged as a golden frontier for no liberal governments a multi billion dollar industry in security and marketing sectors biometric company produced devices like irish scans and facial recognition machines with the hopes of manufacturing the perfect automated identification tools that can successfully read accident of the body biometric devices are becoming powerful weapons to control and police national borders on citizenship status track and target a nation nor companies at misamis as well as to profile and paraissent of the public interests

261.87,267.51, a similar study recently emerged at the university of washington in 
268.14,296.67, what could be the benefits of proving to the world that such a recognition operation exists does it not only further confirm in scientifically validate one of the processes of egbert in categories like fat face and gay face it is easy enough to claim that these studies passengers that will inevitably be used against us it offers a visibility that will attempt to control monitor and police
297.3,311.88, in response to facial recognition technologies we ask what are the tactics and techniques for making our faces non existent how do we fully divisibility into the fall of a queerness that refuses to be recognized
312.54,348.78, today there are numerous modulations of a queer politic centering around gaining visibility through recognition just think of current debates around same sex marriage in the us such calls to visibility typically coincide with the desire for recognition from the state or a longing to be validated by our nelida there is also another queer politics that could be said to be concerned with the non recognizable politics that is the titanian let's call it politics of escape as captors a desire to exit current regimes of control but also to cultivate forms of living otherwise

376.95,387.99, in response to these emerging studies that length successfully determining sexual orientation through rapid facial recognition techniques we propose weapon izing the face through masks
388.62,400.74, solidarity with anonymous pussy riot and the zapatistas we embrace the power of the collective face we make our faces common with a mason become a faceless threat the query
401.58,436.65, the tradition of collective protest actions that have adenoidal recognition like the black block we have produced a collective fat face mass that offers a mutated alien face the cannot be read or purse or bag face mask generated from the biometric facial data of many queer men spaces allows you to where the faces of many with the single mast while facial detection claims that a homosexual terrorist criminal ondometer immigrant or acted as can be recognized simultaneously wearing the faces of many confuses the apparatus and make you unrecognizable to it
437.61,443.97, in our age of informatio capture data villains and recognition control
444.72,486.36, escape and becoming imperceptible or serious threats to the state and capitalism just consider the eighteen forty five law that was resurrected by the united in september and eleven against occupy wall street that the two or more people wearing masks in public illegal and less a masquerade party was being thrown or the mass legislation that is currently underway in canada the fat faced masatierra non existent to any available algorithms this nonexistence produces its own autonomous visibilities in ways to find one another becoming non existent turns your face into a fog and fought makes revolt possible
