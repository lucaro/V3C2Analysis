0.69,15.63, i think it's hard for most people to appreciate how easy it is to build your own home by a gas system perhaps we want things to be more complicated than they are in order to somehow justify the suffering we've had to endure all these centuries trying to live without domestic mirages tres
15.81,21.39, or perhaps we've simply kept the simple engineering principles out of the hands of the right people
21.42,44.43, women and children particularly people who would intuitively understand that the waste from our kitchens and bathrooms can complete the growth cycle and become soil and food and fuel once again and we realize that all we are really building a stomach with a mouth and a throat and anatina arter this mimicries easy to understand if you think of a biologist as a baby or his animal a fire breathing dragon if you like
44.43,45.81, rather than the machine
46.11,47.34, it is simple
47.55,50.91, here's how you do it the solar cities open source way
51.3,62.85, yourself an old ice tank an international bulk container you can find these used ibs these pallet based one thousand leader plastic shipping containers literally all over the world
63.09,67.47, take three and whole saw and drill three holes in the top of the tank it shone
67.71,79.8, if you're in a place with no electricity and no power drill take a piece of metal pipe with a three inch diameter and heated up and melt the hole through the plastic we did this in the dominican republic with a three inch metal sink strainer
79.86,88.2, he is millimeters for those of your doing metric this is the diameter of the outer flange of the two inch uncials we use
88.26,94.77, next get yourself three two and tunis greece them up with plummer silicon and popped them into the holes
94.83,101.22, next cut three pieces of two in her fifty millimeters sewer pipe to a lamp of one point five meters
102.33,106.17, designate one of the pipes as the feeding pipe
106.8,109.95, cut the bottom and a degree angle
111.78,118.86, so that the food was you put in can slide out easily into the bottom of the tank this gives the pipe a point and
118.98,129.66, and any rough edges and sop up the pipe and the inner ring of the unsealed and firmly pushed the pipe through the unsetting as you go until it reached the bottom of the tank and stops
130.35,135.54, designated the second of your three pipes as the gas outlet pipe and cut a hole
135.57,155.37, so that it will be just below the top of the digester when inserted through the second unseal and pushed to the bottom yes you'll have to measure this one is the height of your eyes can vary you can do this by putting the pipe in the whole before you put the unsealing and making a mark with a permanent marker about two centimetres below the place where the top of the tank touches the pipe
155.37,162.21, make sure you and the edges of this whole smooth and flush so it doesn't cut or get stuck on the unsealing the way down
162.75,166.35, then push the gas outlet pipe into the tank through the unity
167.46,189.69, we like to put the feeding pipe and the gas outlet pipe on the same side of the digester as we find that this is where most of the food settles and most of the gas arises and collects designate the third of your two inch pipes the slurry or affluent type where the rich organic liquid fertilizer or compost tea will exit we cut a hole in his last pipe
189.87,214.53, you also and the edges of this whole smooth and flood soon cut or get stuck in the unity on the way down so that when it's pushed down to the bottom through the unseal the whole will be somewhere near the middle of the tank we do this because by octave solids are being digested at the bottom of the tank mostly carbon protein while lipans and fats will rise and be digested at the top of the tank and we don't want to remove feed stock that is still energy rich
214.62,229.98, by placing the outflow pipe on the opposite side of the tank diagonally across from the feeding pipe we maximize the hydraulic retention time of the feeding material that is the time it spends being digested in the tank so we can win the maximum amount of energy from it
230.04,239.91, since our gestures are a kind of plug flowed i jested design the food we pushed in one side of the tank is slowly shoved to the other side of the tank when new material is added
239.91,262.08, the fertilizer before out with each feeding has had the best opportunity to get digested and because we draw it from the middle of the far end of the tank it comes out as a liquid that is lightenin nutrient rich but doesn't clog pipes the sledge can stay in for years and years and only rarely needs to be pumped out to make a solid compost with these three pipes in place your basically done with the digester
262.2,266.76, rest is plumbing first we want to take care of the gas outlet pipe
266.88,279.42, two inch pipe sticking up above the digester insures that the gas outlet is well above the water line and his wide enough that manure or other solid you may have put into inoculator digester don't clog the pipe and stop the gas from coming out
279.6,286.68, at the top of this pipe we put it two inch to half inch producer a half inch petallous
286.71,289.71, and a half inch bar pose connector
289.86,304.08, we don't blow these on in case we ever need to remove them to clear any possible clogs should they arise for the fertilizer outlet pipe we first cut off about five centimeters at the top and then attach a two inch tea a piece of two inch pipe
304.23,307.95, to angelo and a dream pipe leading to the fertilizer bucket
308.16,315.15, every time you add ground up food waste and water to the system from the feeding an equivalent amount of misery will be forced out
315.15,322.59, the degree part of the tea is lower than the feeding pipe so whenever it filled the fertilizer pipe lover spill and drain into the bucket
322.83,338.34, sky facing part of the tea in sure there be no vapor lock otherwise she'll get a siphoning effect such as we experienced from we built one with an elbow instead of a tea in swaziland a sifting will drain your tank in no time but with a tea the system automatically regulate
338.52,347.19, the fertilizer the results is perfect for hydroponic and thereupon a gardens deluded with gray water ten to one you should never have to buy fertilizer again
347.73,355.11, we put a funnel on to the feeding pipe were ground up kitchen scraps fulminans and plate scrapings and what not are poured
355.56,363.66, unlike most compost piles there is no food waste that you can't put in fruit and vegetable rinds cooked food meat and grease you name it
363.69,370.5, you just have to grind your mathieu and mix with water thirty or so by water is fine so that it will fit down the pipe without clogging
370.8,375.33, in the dominican republic we used five gallon water jugs cut in half as our funnels
375.51,386.1, build your digester lower than your sink and install a food rider took up the outlet of the grinder directed the feeding pipe just don't forget to have a pipe or hostage to a tea to prevent a vacuum lock
386.1,392.1, of course this digester doesn't store guess so for that he'll need some other form of storage
392.28,441.24, we tend to use p c balloons or bladders basically plastic bags connected the tank with cheer clear plastic tubing they were just fine in new york we built these digesters and two family basements and the gas is red outside in the bags with a tea lightning the output to the kitchen stove yes modest as a perfectly safe to use in the home and they are generally odorless i fed correctly but if you do waterish never be any smells emanating from the pipes porthoning table oil or saturnin the feeding and out flopped every couple of weeks and lightly cap them if you're building your digester outside there a couple of things to finish up if you were in a hot climate paint your digester black for one thing the gestures are animals stomachs with the same microbes that live in animals doing the digestion and they need to be kept in body temperature
441.48,483.45, so will heat up a black digester and help keep it warm for another thing the microbes must be kept in the dark if light gets into your digester which it will though the white plastic of the tank algier in the tank produce oxygen and kill off your anoroc you'll get lots of gas but will all be carbonite so the tank should be opaque if you're building your solar cities digester outside in a cold climate you need to insulate it we found that cheap styrofoam and stretch wrapped and work okay if you put enough layers but your best off if you can get the thing pompret and in really cold climate you should insulate and put into a greenhouse and even put pachecos inside connected to a sort of hot water like a solar heater or
483.45,488.07, shower bath using the grey water as it comes out warm
488.07,490.35, but that's the subject of another tutorial
490.5,502.98, we hope you will join the solar cities evolution to make the benefits of my gas affordable and simple for every one it really is easier than you think so please do try this in home
