168.27,172.29, so molestation is forecast to grow
172.83,178.68, do you see your district being able to deal with such rapid growth straining the roadways
178.71,183.03, in inventories the filled elementary schools

187.62,198.12, you tell right well all of may is scenes projected to grow and grow pretty big and pretty quick
198.39,208.41, in south may we have come up with the maiden and in south mary we've set the areas where we want development to go
208.68,215.76, right now we have approved some are around homes in south may
216.0,217.92, which are being built now
218.07,223.17, actually a little bit more than as we have some rentals so
223.2,227.19, going is the best that the council can
227.25,232.44, have to deal with the extremely high cost of roads
232.5,238.56, water in our sewer were not a capacity and we're because is working on
238.59,240.42, up with the
240.66,247.2, the structures to make sure that the water doesn't run out and that the sewer doesn't run out
247.38,252.87, schools were keep encouraging the department of education to
253.83,259.68, get the schools coming in were trying to work with some developers to build kind of like camelias built
261.96,263.67, as we just
263.7,269.31, the more people would get the more we have to get more police officers to
269.34,273.27, or park rangers we have a park ranger program to so
273.45,275.58, some of the things that were
276.21,277.23, it's
277.71,281.37, takes a while to have that happen and were slowly building that up
284.28,288.84, same question south molly's population is forested to grow
288.84,318.06, do you see your district being able to deal with such rapid growth straining roadways housing inventories elementary and high school and crime an area part sank you actually were doing much better on schools right now than we were when my kids were little and we had almost two thousand kids and come up the kihootin in the schools we have some time on that and with the key charteris
318.12,371.55, specifically what we need to work on now is infrastructure and we also need to work on we know which means roads and housing of course but we also need to work on waste water facilities and what's happening with our shore line we have some of the worst water on the island in rhododendrons right now and so we really need to get involved in that and save our reef that way as far as rosediamond i've been talking to people in the community talking to the keyboard that we do want to get involved we want to help priorities as we review our 
371.61,410.7, my plan but we need to know those ideas are going to be respected and we need to know that what we come up with in the review is going to sing to have the force and effect of a real guide line which had not been done so far and that's why we almost got the promenade all you know in area that supposed to be light institutional collaboration with developers on affordable housing of in talking to developers across the county and they do want to be involved they have ideas people in the park have talked apart rangers who have ideas about bringing the homeless in to do some part time work with you know cleaning up the park we need to start listening to them and create these programs
415.2,424.53, thank you keith aviator kellerton is going to go to you the second one
424.53,430.44, individuals families and communities and are social service agencies are stressed to the man
430.65,434.04, what are your plans to address the considerable burdens
434.19,436.77, my social infrastructure
436.95,443.1, number two part second part of it are you willing to raise property taxes to find your proposals
443.76,464.7, so much for the question because i agree that social services are not currently keeping up with demand and its interesting that none of the forms of till now have actually mentioned social services they've all been on different topics and so it's good that we are lymphatic violence
464.82,511.59, sensitivity there's a lot of stress being put on multiple households and so that leads to some of the like the drug abuse some of these things i really feel like we have a very good cordonnerie i worked with the steward with mental health condition the first thing we need to do is to look at our current services and how we can work with the non profits the government the for profits gets on funding and there's a lot of funding this not being tapped on the federal level on the state level and even the county there's a lot of that ethereal
511.71,516.03, figure out you know they're doing a tremendous job with held little they have
516.03,518.91, we can get to the point where we can actually figure out
518.94,556.05, the plans in the bench marks and then put money into those action plans where we can actually have no wind the successes are what are we trying to do and when we know that we've been successful we can representation where we could feel like the theresienstadt system because every year these non privates have to spend so much time and energy coming back to the council begging for money and we can make it so much easier if we went to a state system of a banian
557.43,559.17, he that
559.29,561.3, on some question
563.43,567.36, individuals families communities and are social services

603.93,610.29, i tried to get some services for my mom on the mainland when she had some heart problems and needed
610.41,613.26, the stuff that we do here we take for granted here
614.31,621.36, don't do that they don't do that and how and southern california you would think southern california with all the money that's there
621.51,627.24, they will do that they don't have anywhere near the services we have for our
628.62,637.35, in fact when we go to the national association of counties and talk to our peers around the state around the country now he has the best
637.86,640.68, elderly care in the nation
641.28,644.19, i'm very proud to say that i hoped
644.76,664.56, approved the funding for that it's very important that we take care of our components and we're having a lot of people move in here to retire here so that's just getting bigger and bigger there are many other areas the homeless especially that's the other end we need to get affordable housing and also
664.86,666.69, home in place

670.17,685.98, belongings and go to their jobs and feel safe to scare them we can work on rehabilitation and getting them the services they need because we have all the services they need it just there at capacity as far as raising taxes
