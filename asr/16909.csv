0.06,24.33, powell the book is about the global transformation were experiencing
24.6,30.54, the particular crisis point and we have to understand historically
30.54,33.45, why the crisis is
33.75,37.11, producing a new class structure
37.74,42.78, and essentially want happened was back in the nineteen eighty
42.87,48.96, the liberals took command of the economic policy and strategy
49.2,50.97, and they have
51.48,55.95, led to a global market system taking shape
56.61,63.72, in the process what's been happening is that we've expanded the global labor market
63.9,68.34, huge downward pressure on our living standards in europe
68.34,72.87, and produce a new class structure that's the background
73.2,84.48, a structure is not the percent one per cent that occupy a movement and indignantly to focus on its more complex than that
84.66,87.21, we've got a plutocracy at the top
87.3,91.47, a disgustingly rich and powerful
91.5,105.54, millionaires and multi billionaire long way below that you've got a salaried people who still got employment security and soon the old working class the proletariat it is shrinking
105.96,107.76, it's the preterit
107.79,110.61, that is growing and they prepared
110.64,116.31, is a dangerous class in the sense that it rejects
116.46,120.21, old political ideologies of the tenth century
120.48,125.04, and you can define the precario as a combination of factors
125.4,127.08, millions of people
127.62,129.21, and
129.39,130.5, so young
131.04,132.36, are
132.45,138.93, having three combinate factors one is that they are being habituated
139.02,143.85, precious to accept a life of unstable labour
144.21,145.83, unstable living
146.28,163.71, which they are expected to have casual jobs in an out of dominion but more potently without any occupational identity and the occupational narrative to give to their lives and they have to do a lot of work
163.77,173.85, doesn't get counted a lot of that is unpaid its former exploitation and at the same time
173.94,174.93, they
175.05,231.93, find that their level of education is above the level of labour that they have to do so that that's one characteristic the second character is to give that they after relievedly on money wages than in get any benefits they don't get any right space benefits state benefits and the living on the edge of debt unsustainable debt one mistake wonderful mishap and there out and homeless and son and the third thing that is very important is that this is a first class that is losing rights losing the ordinary rights of a citizen and there being turned into suppliant asking for famous having too satisfied bureaucrats always being under control and the combination of circumstances is producing
232.2,245.79, i call the four as an army sent him to spare alienation a sense that they can't do what they would like to do and have to do a lot of things they don't want to do
245.97,248.16, a sense of anxiety
248.43,269.4, sense of anger and his anger is very transformative potentially because it's a new dangerous class in that it rejects the old social democracy laborest genders of the twentieth century but is not
269.43,288.51, wanting to accept the new liberalism it is rejecting both and looking for an alternative and the interesting thing since two thousand and eleven is that the precarious known suddenly becoming a class for itself
288.87,292.62, that means is millions of people
292.86,300.21, instead of seeing themselves as famous a sentencing themselves as having deficiencies
300.33,308.37, they are suddenly seeing the structures out there and a recognising themselves as part of the precario
308.43,310.62, and they can stand up and say
311.1,329.4, i am proud i am i belong to raritan ing to be ashamed about that is the system wanting me to be like this and not an underclass i'm not a member of the underclass and that is important because only when millions of people
329.82,333.81, come aware that they are part of a class
334.35,350.37, come together and start fortune and new politics what i call a new politics of paradise and i think we are in that stage now where suddenly millions of people are identifying themselves
350.4,351.78, the carrier
352.14,354.27, the political
354.3,355.59, energy
355.77,362.7, transforming it into a new dangerous past but is threatening the state
362.88,382.98, that i think is a very important phase in the counter attack that's why we're seeing new political movements like pedantic and reserve like the semitropical libertin italy like various social movements that are coming up these movements are shaping
383.13,396.78, a new progressive politics so in the next two years there will be mistakes there will be false steps but your seeing an agenda and i'm trying to articulate what
397.17,399.63, a charter of demands
400.11,403.08, of the precarious would look like
403.44,413.73, just as all of us who are social scientists and people who are listening and analyzing it in an economist so i see the economic
413.76,421.23, our job is to supply the ammunition supply the ideas
421.29,427.14, for giving security and reviving sense of future
427.2,430.38, sense that we can have a good society
430.38,436.56, we can have more freedom we can have more equality and we can have solidarity back
437.01,448.56, that is the agenda that we have to ford and it is up to the new politicians the political activists to articulate that agenda
448.77,452.49, that is basically what the two books are about
452.88,460.89, i'm often asked whether the new political movements like damascened number of other
460.92,463.5, months can succeed
463.92,469.38, against the traitor against the new liberal agenda
469.53,474.09, answer is we must try
474.09,479.07, and the important thing is that the precarious
479.22,486.66, come class for itself and its important for the new politicians
486.75,488.4, the progressive
488.4,490.95, spare of society
491.13,496.17, youse a concept that can describe us
496.38,497.7, the people
498.51,501.24, and in doing so
501.33,505.44, they will forge a unity of purpose
505.89,509.4, only when there's a unity of purpose
509.43,512.58, vital change take place
512.79,516.66, he will change sides
517.08,524.28, the last years fear has been on our side we have been fearful
524.31,529.32, and we have made concessions and the new liberal hegemony
529.35,530.76, consider
531.6,534.6, now only if we become
534.6,538.98, united social force for change saying
540.24,541.95, love is enough
542.58,555.33, demand change will fear change sights again and that i think is where we are and why it is so vitally important to see this in international terms
555.75,560.94, collectively we have strength if we make
560.94,573.24, the people who are the plutocracy and the elite making all this money in the financial markets and elsewhere made them realize that they have to change
573.63,591.48, they have to move away from things like quantitative easing which is a way of enriching the financial markets and the trillion eros that is going to be spent a little bit will trickle down perhaps
591.48,596.25, the incomes in the financial markets will be booted
596.76,603.12, they have to start realizing that they cannot spend the money like that
604.05,611.79, not face social consequences and the social consequences will be that we get angrier and angrier
612.09,628.59, come revolutionary in the imitative sense but be demanding changes in such a way that they will have to start making concessions and it is about time because the inequalities
628.98,630.42, tess
630.57,633.18, securities are grotesque
633.36,655.02, unacceptable and the unsustainable for the reasons i mentioned earlier including the fact that this nepasset movement out there is growing in strength and is a threat to all of us so i think we do have to realize that what movements like pedals
655.14,661.29, is doing it is setting setting out on a journey
661.92,672.57, in a sense that they were of course will make mistakes but we must support such movements because they are breaking the acceptance which has been too long
672.66,710.46, of social democracy laboratis and soon they accommodated to the new liberal agenda without consulting it and this is now a point foremost confrontation
