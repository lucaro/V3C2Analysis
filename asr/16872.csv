370.14,371.34, maybe like
371.34,373.26, two or three years of meeting on
373.38,378.69, i was able to quit my corporate gate and go join the surface with remark
379.05,390.48, and it was you know it was a good job it was you know was amazing it was sort of like i was able to come take their sort of first couple of years of publishing

393.78,404.07, one the man now and just make it my own entirely i could read this everything resign all the calls brand you know what i'm saying like just really
404.13,426.66, and at the time you know i was bringing in influences from famous masters and bringing in influences from deep red cascabel was an illustrator as well and anna was you know bringing in you know those kinds of visual influences i want to remark to have wanted to give it a visual punch that
426.66,427.74, just
427.83,432.51, because what i'm looking at something i feel like it should look as good as it is written
432.9,444.33, you know there's really no excuse for a magazine to a bad design and casuality designers of there that would just love the opportunity i just like
444.57,459.66, on this thing i wanted to make it the best magazine or magazine going i will you know there was a lot of competition of there at the time and the office is like when they hired me they they had an office and i that's where i ever ate and then they bought
459.84,463.77, in a movie theater in turn it into remark was awesome
463.98,490.8, the one to the west and eternally bought a funeral home and which was like the historical building and it was amazing you know the funeral became the remark as a horror i mean you can't even write that you know like an inodorous helped the profile of the magazine and it was it was just a bustling place man like every every one in time wanted to visit you know let me climb bark or would drop by angus scream which drop by
490.83,509.25, you get to meet these people and they had seen the man the errors of the magazine and they like what you do and you know but people picked up on at least they picked up on it they picked up on the passionate agonising today which is great
512.76,519.21, as much as i love the job there i gave it him for my own stuff honestly is that
519.27,527.49, covers i was doing the level of our work i was doing for the magazine and the amount of work actually i mean i was our work weeks
527.49,530.94, i mean it was just kind of like you know what
531.39,605.25, after after you know thirteen ten plus years i always writing for a change and an inclines we all know the you know the news stands are shrinking and and soreheaded ing dollars that go into magazines that a people to be there and and you know i just you know i was kind of the right time for me a sort of like in a way i'm i'm getting some recognition yes and i'm getting emails from finders i was also doing stuff on the side ysabeau le years before actually left the magazine i was doing you know some stuff whenever i could fitton the side so that already started working with some some big profile stuff like gelsomina with larry festina glamour glassite bichat was a lot of fine great stuff you know so as to set like that i was doing her obituary going maybe a couple of armide titles on the side andoas well i started in working with them not as much as i do now but at the time you know i would find in when i could you know and just here i knew it my extracurricular stuff was doing this like
605.43,632.73, you know and so i thought well you know first year is going to be a little rocky luckily my wife you know works very good job and you know she sort of was like you know my safety natalie it there in the first year but my second year was like okada i could of the magazine of my third year okay i'm trying to make goosberry a brand as well as 
632.73,683.31, you know ah i mean illustrator and i'm an artist but not on time you know i wanted to be anonymous i didn't want the intention and i just wanted the work out there and this was in the early days of remark i just i didn't want to be interviewed i didn't want to be in front of a camera and even like that i don't still don't really want to but but now i don't mind talking about my artworks i wanted me now when i need an artist i want to know about them too but so far a while i sort of put that that was little shy with that stuff but what then i realize well you're not going to get anywhere if you're just sitting in the basement not talking to anybody right so i wanted you know i started to conaille more some promotion you know and and say hey like captured but i'm also you know glister
686.43,727.32, i was going to find with real for years we did tons of conventions and so i was going you know with the magazine but i was getting a lot of accolades for the work my work and then we were but actually they would let me take a corner of their wit and so some of my own friends and you know that was really that you know they encouraged it too wasn't just like you know they just see nonentity now they were very taboureau you know they wanted they want as you know people happy so you know i mean it was good that way too because i could sort of like do both you know they may definitely come to me with titles
727.5,739.86, now you know i think my work speaks to a particular kind of onusual it's the eighties to the bright vivid stuff you know recover the top moves
739.98,770.34, i definitely you know i do a lot of movie stuff and i'll believe it but you know i also like when i i like to say i stop out of the graveyard a little bit i like doing like i recently did ten clover field lane now i know it's a horror film but it's not a bite you know it's got its gossome clothilde doing horripilating you know with you know was my brand is here towards that but i also you know i mean i love not doing not worreted stuff too
770.55,801.6, and i you know i'm always sort of excited i didn't globose you know and opposed her further hockey movie the good you know or at all any know i you know i've done premature was a comedy that for i have seen that i did so i sort of life i like stepping out to you know i want i want to show people that i'm not just you know like i don't want to go tossing over and over and you know in the end it's coming up with a concept and the executing i want to show that i can do
802.29,810.06, he was now as with that was when they were on their own
810.21,834.96, and yet just you know as spencer contacted me in and said haitian work for us assiduously you know i've done a bidon record covers before but not not horror maestra studious my first flag tackling a sound track design or you know one of my favorite maestoso that was sort of a
834.99,876.3, on that kind of opened floodgates little but i think with you know again what can i bring you to a billposters or a contract to sign a name it you know at ilminster the music inspires it from the sound track sometimes it's just kind of a no grainer sometimes the warming they have a particular idea then that helps and i go from there you know so it's sort of like you know you just sort of like what what what can i can i bring to it like this movies i've turned down because i just feel that i can't bring anything new to that it doesn't excite that's been done before or one better
876.3,891.6, you know i mean that you know so i try to fix stuff that excites me if i get that initial reaction with the title a film a really super pomaerium not to mire with it all revisit it
895.53,940.62, sometimes like a well with i guess with windlike those say he be got any he got any stuff i use her to get any migratory thing yet and you know sir postulant you know you like oh why as i can manseau of days or you look in your your back files sometimes brightly i mean you talkers like you know ten ideas for one thing so there's i've got like a back pocket filled with light you know ideas of avonlea perfectly good that just for what reason didn't work for for that particular project so i just keep all that stuff like around you know and just float around like i got a post her for that i had an idea for that we can answer
940.62,945.54, so i do sometimes i pitch for all i'll email 
945.63,959.28, a particular person and athelwold love to work with you you know i don't do it as much as i should i should hustle a little more but i find that the work is coming in so it's sort of like
959.31,1016.43, you know i haven't had a date like you know a portfolio or show to it the pavement right i mean luckily even i in sort of like inundated with you know people wanting a movie poster whether elkin that nobody seemed to like you know a property that you know i got some o you know we want to call godsons behind scotty know it's it's got a lot of recognition behind so emancipated
1016.43,1069.98, away with releasing it she wanted to it officially i mean i'm sort of like i feel like i'm a little bit on the radar now so i do everything officially or i get permission from the person that you know a film director or something you know so sterilon put out myself obviously but yet for posters and in our work but he would love to do it exacerbate montesquieu was my first full packaging for london for that i had done till from the crittenden clay face seven inch i think it was something else but then the attentive as that was my operation of the wolf man and then and then i had designed
1070.19,1084.68, the back cover for all the releases the online is monastery you know
1084.83,1086.12, and
1087.47,1101.72, this idea actually you know i shot a shop them a few ideas for the front cover care for my wolf man and and then i also thought you know i'm going to show them this cool idea i had
1102.08,1122.45, of like the sort of like classified ads in the back of a monster magazine connotated away for a mask or you know extrablaetter it is those crazy classifies and and it was sort of like i got excited because it was like well i just you know like you can ask the monstrous qui
1122.96,1126.02, property with that kind of them
1126.02,1134.27, and it really seemed to work so morally like that so we made them all you know the back covers where we goncalo coat of them a sort of man the front but
1134.57,1148.88, when it came time to go the full pocket an they said he you know what we really like that idea of you know the whole monster the classified ads the fake ads for for stuff why don't we do that for the full packaging
1148.91,1167.09, and i just seem to make sense of that i got excited and and i was sort of like to like you know you can do like a roof off like you know jack davis as you know six foot frankenstein cut out the house to be able to buy and hang on the wall when we do you know noonshine take masterson and just
1167.09,1178.73, you know master with that all that great stuff that we remember from where it masterpieces i love doing as final at you can play with that seniawan do so early
1178.76,1182.84, really great stuff i can't wait to get to the label part
1183.32,1185.36, place it over the old man
1185.75,1196.43, no nor you know there's a northman stupid stuff like that like it makes it you know kind of juvenile but it spaniolated to the movie or
1196.58,1217.43, i'm really tired about something in soap of the label on a coloured final which is not an you know a few times like like i guess i mean example that would be frightened the insane that we can land on the same idea there with the mass right
1217.7,1221.84, knowingly or two minds but
1221.84,1256.37, you know i just sort of man you know i sort of like so i put that to watch easily don't we make them the right of the green but of course you know it's like that plantat makes so much sense you know for the move and you layin on those ideas and your delay just taken to a whole new level italie i had that as the sunderland kevin's like white make a picture in cottonopolis that final you know just bursting came comes a mind altogether on the back of a shod
1256.4,1266.63, he is off and you can see all the little tents down and not tunnel so fun stuff like that you know i mean that kind of what that's kind of like a man of bed in the morning
1270.14,1292.58, like i would love like the changeling to come out i mean go back to a property that i love to tackle and i've done some change langlade our work here and there but it's all onto know sort of line on my own kind of thing but i would love to do like an official foster or to the counter carisbury good
1292.58,1311.84, and but there probably is this in you know and i could tell they understand through my doin wardens there is here no fences going to cover the cost of intepretation pay the ears he added make his dam things and solemn time and energy to insert
1311.93,1354.14, certain titles may not be ready for it yet you know i don't know i mean there's no contriving living in obscurity i mean you know i talk about the changing bit because i want to keep emotion to keep it in the mind's eye an that's a great about it like i have done i know like you know london abortively trying to find those films that you want to see as strathoran like the there they're finding the people who did it like him i've been i beeble to help to a little bit with some of my cackle i been able to say hey i can put you in touch with that person and before we knew it we had the record out you know what i mean i thought that was great you know just come bathershins you know and like you said likely
1354.14,1365.18, we all have the same taste i want to see the same things like teresa know who's putting that out like i would love it extinguishes not music on it but
1365.33,1397.64, even if the lilac christmas were a lot of just kind of visual or audio custer is some music but there's a lot there's enough there to make a cool looking record yeah i did i mean that was a man again that's another light you know kind of guedelha balistarii was on the baccalaureate who you know like i'm working with toinette guys were great luckily i
1397.73,1403.82, i've gotten a marine in the band he lives in cyrano ah
1404.03,1424.31, so yeah i mean you know he were friends you know you know he comes to events you put on and stuff and we hang out and he's just a really cool guy and they're very excited now that there's been resurgence when
1424.34,1432.5, and then the gallant thinking about because he knew him and also a friend of mine on keepers was working merchant
1432.68,1443.24, they want to do a closer for two or reading i'm going to go on the road with them and i'm going to help them solve the march wind olinto come up to image is a course
1443.69,1449.15, and we did and i got to do posters for them so both tours they
1449.27,1455.24, thirteen and thousand fourteen got to do a poster for each to her
1455.3,1462.41, again i sort of like you know getting products like that i think is really important for a lot of
1462.44,1465.77, young designers out there begins
1466.07,1483.26, its profile too right getting your name attached to something that has a fan base you know that's going to that's going to accelerate your brand too so now a days i sort of thick projects
1483.35,1490.25, they do have a little juice behind them you know they do have an best behind them they do have recognition
1490.31,1492.92, i mean because
1493.16,1496.31, if it's an in film okay they've got
1496.94,1503.87, some known actors in there or they've got a trailer you know it's a go you know what i mean they're not 
1503.87,1511.46, in the film that are our work but like a cold do a lot of those kinds of pills but it's not really going to get seen on a wide
1512.87,1523.61, so that gets to be important at some point to where you want to make sure that the stuff you're doing is reaching a wide eyes because that means your reaching a wide audience to
1528.44,1537.53, for sure like pretty much every project you know you get that sort of like a man what can i bring the table gear like a
1538.46,1546.02, now working on a poster for really well known to for a really well known lorian
1546.59,1547.94, in the 
1548.03,1560.72, and the tale as the perpetual has been re interpreted a billion basilian times by some of the top of cultured to the best in the world
1561.5,1567.5, yesterday so what can i do that's going to be different 
1567.53,1572.6, you know what can i bring to the table that's going to excite
1572.6,1591.26, a new fan of potential new fan of the movie and fans of the old filadoro before him like to me it's got to have a concept behind it like what different wapentakes been done before like you know like say
1591.47,1595.31, as a stupid example like a fiction
1595.34,1606.44, what can i do that's going to be different than the silian culture restitutions okay i'm gonna take the men you
1606.56,1608.27, the restaurant
1608.27,1610.28, with all
1610.67,1615.38, and she relied for so withersteen
1615.95,1618.89, what can i do etrangere
1619.04,1632.57, that scene i can take the menu that there at the restaurant and make a post route of the men the kind of thing you know that might that might be exciting or what can i do
1632.66,1636.77, like like like i haven't got jaws yet
1637.85,1646.97, mainly because i just haven't had that other and there's been some incredible like recent interpretations of that post
1647.21,1669.05, my justice one just recently the shirt you know making up the sky line you know really old like a man so yet you get that sort of you do get that fear and so that at cerolian what can i what can i bring them a table that's going to excite me over the next month or week or erling's going to take to do and excite
1669.08,1682.28, enfans animal finds so that does get the best cataline bit you know to get a little bit like intimidating you know i've always liked you know
1682.43,1702.2, there you know like i said i mentioned earlier and working on a post of that i just can't seem to have to get too excited about my ideas because i regard came and it's like i know that there's something else that i missed my missing some wished for that one thing that's really gone you know excited me to spend the next two weeks on it you know what i mean
1702.29,1704.03, so
1704.18,1712.28, i can be that can be a challenge like eachother times it can be easier laureate idea in mind
1712.67,1748.94, oh i can't wait like finally somebody asks me to do that or any near this poster and in the side like even if it's a stupid scatter of tumbledown somewhere you know that excites me too and okove got something in the bank that i can reap visit and saying for a poster that it wasn't done thank god i didn't really spend my time on but i started roughing it at and it was a pet cemetery poster i and i was going to do it for a company is going to be a license one and
1749.06,1764.93, a waterloo a face book and you know you know gallery name it whatever there was my very idea already fleshed out very iterates cool but you know just i just
1764.93,1807.68, to the drawing board and even didn't even you know it was just too close yes they basic thing but here's the but part that i think a lot of us as are as we're always trying to be the inventors right like hay we came with that idea first and that's what i like to do is sort of at least not like look we didn't invent the wheel but like we like to be the first to say hey you know that was my conduct and nobody's really done anything quite like it that's always soothe best case scenario but what happens sometimes as you do land on an idea that somebody has already done or it's a little bit close and i used to stratoides whatever if they were just a sidenote and i was talking to rob jones monastery thing and he says you know what
1808.31,1810.02, you're going to do differently
1810.02,1812.27, because everything's been done before
1812.93,1820.04, everything is literally been done before so just do it in your own way and it will be different
1820.19,1823.01, and no one would ever put the two together really
1823.37,1859.28, you can you can take two things and put them together and that becomes original ye like i knew going in so they said you know artisan me with bandoline to do fantasm and i was like absolutely like you know i do imagine the series and yette you know so i was like you know yahoos like oh what am i going to do it's been in abilities but
1859.61,1866.78, just sort of like when i found what the packaging was going to be like and a conocil
1867.05,1875.33, come second striking like so you know eradicate out we may be we can do something assures
1875.57,1878.48, with that thought okay well
1878.66,1879.62, let
1879.89,1887.63, something like that for the outer box and then how do i tie in all the movies into one of
1887.63,1899.78, this of seti i wanted him to look like when it spilled out that it all belongs together rather than okay here's fantasm wine and let's get every hatstand there and
1899.96,1912.29, stone and okay here's francis to and let's get the same characters with just facing different ways he anatolie you know i've got you now i'm starting to see a lot of
1912.35,1937.82, i really got a kind o get that fatigue with like the illustrated body parts you know so i try to come up i like coming up with concepts and not just your favorite character holding on to an ice cream cone and over her it was another guilliadun but you know i mean thus do i was pitiable for it but i try to steer the culinary from those types of things so when i wanted to do was have come with a ball
1938.69,1941.39, why don't we you know
1941.87,1943.97, every move has
1944.09,1945.62, new ball
1945.89,1962.27, you know part to have been the one with the little wind beloit and then her three hadley know the saratov in the eyeball and he now perforator had the son the head you know
1962.78,1969.74, of it and it was like why don't we just kind of like brand it with the ball all about the ball and
1970.13,1987.62, and economically it worked too you know we could get it done and the short amount of time they wanted it done and i just sort of picholoroni the theme and just went with it and that's an when they first saw it they were like astonishes no
1987.77,1999.83, the baron you know i may be some minor sweets which is the best you can hope for and and heaps its kind o worked out in a really great way
1999.95,2006.34, you know the box that was an example of the packaging steering lesigne
2006.85,2011.8, i like the game of this concept now we can come over ideas to make the package
2011.83,2015.58, it was more or less like i knew that i was going to have a ball in it
2015.61,2018.85, and they sent me sort of like a really raw
2019.24,2025.33, digital three photo of the box with the ball in it for the advantage
2025.33,2027.1, all worked out right
2027.61,2034.99, i certainly have inter going to be on the case but there are only a certain size of the gotthold all the films in this little thing
2035.32,2038.83, i actually nowadays i do everything is like a poster
2040.06,2041.29, make it
2041.56,2047.05, it could be a poster after they might like it so much since ablowing up the art work again
2047.68,2078.01, eventooally got to see the orchestration in the theatre as i was sort of on the job and that was great you know i got to watch that film in the theater and so is nice revisiting it but i've seen that move enough times where i think i probably could come up with something you know a certain films i will go back and watch again like
2078.16,2102.61, said because there was all these little things in the club house i wanted to see her like you know sometimes you you know when you're doing our work for a film or tourists you will watch them move again because you know you're looking at the different when you're sort of officially working on it and so occasionally you know i tried to watch the movies
2102.64,2140.83, sometimes sometimes you don't always have the time either but you know but i like to again servitors know the mesaville or you know just ideas floating around in the attic there i think i could you know probably do a movie that i am so well versed in i could probably don't need to watch that one again the only time would do that is if like i said i you know am i undrawing the bedroom
2141.25,2155.83, bernheim i might go back and see what's on the walls and see how that kind of stuff loonatic lar line a dialogue sometimes but but mostly like a defence but i like to see the movies you know before i
2155.89,2159.94, before i do start because again you are a sort of seeing it the different eyes
2164.47,2176.65, yet a lot of late spring grass while watching the panatella you know your past to take or angle sometimes you'll you'll take it
2176.83,2179.95, different pots and put them together to make one
2179.98,2187.87, a reference imitations quite a bit actually you know
2188.14,2195.19, sometimes if you're working on stuff that like well with francis i was lucky enough to have this
2196.99,2296.53, a frog that i bought is not a proper any of the films but it's patterned from a guy in the states and the name of the company's failing the endsleigh are customs i think so this was kononov around just sort of like a need on this angle you know i do ontangle or like dead on continuous would just kindergarten attars and just just get it down sometimes i'll take pictures of you know like my wife makes every model you know i'll need lawyering unto a knife first orontides i can take a picture of her screaming and then i can draw different arctogaeal she is fifty or obedient coming out all twenty four by thirty six in san impassively played a fantastic best which was the festival they wanted to get in because it's so tied into manderton austin played there and yet relieving directed it my saw the film when it was first done in it had a canonisation and then make up distribution which now for pictures who could at the donahue leandro preston so i mean and may they recut the film but its awesome basically like i mean
2296.53,2308.92, so yeah i was really cool to see if like this movie of all and i've kind of like kevinnie for a long time so i you know i was there from the very beginning
2309.04,2328.72, the way through the process to watch him watch and make this my saracens you know it's coming out on davidson don't know when but i definitely at chosroes to see this luting enjoy it it goes chronological it goes from like
2328.72,2342.7, of the opkuk sort of like the roger castalia and so as well all the way to lake kindliest third of the movie is like
2342.88,2352.15, interviews with sort of light contemporary artists doing this kind of our work i mean it's teint think we're called alternative posteris yei think it's more just
2352.15,2357.22, terrestrian i'm not sure how were bill but
2357.64,2364.21, that's interesting i think that a really good job sort of like catching people up to like
2364.33,2383.05, for like again like sort of like the duties grandson events posters you know that kind of stuff to all the way to like the nineties when you know home barndoor work they became harmless really to
2383.17,2386.2, now it's sort of this this bush or
2386.23,2390.55, no work on the covers people want that feeling again
2392.71,2395.2, anyone
2395.23,2434.95, unfortunately may never go away because that's how people needed just the move i mean it you know it's got tom creon it well it's going to have a side profile that time curs and then inside that sidereal be all the leather actors and that may be an exploded at the bottom but it caroline you know they don't dig age people they digest things quicker you know they these little box cover on it tunes and that's what they need to see to you know you can't walk up to a posteritati and look at all the little things up a bit so i get why you know i get it there why it exists but it doesn't mean
2435.04,2440.77, we have to like it you know what i mean in illogical as in latin
2440.89,2477.97, where it's just like a cool striking image it's a concept you know a salacious weren't complex at all they were despairing and why did that go away i mean you know what i mean like why are we need to see every actress face one of finster why can we look at it film as a concept not as a fashion statement or how somebody looks or to cut stuffocated oneness of exact that have artwork on their walls but even they don't have the power we
2477.97,2536.14, all the way with because of consumers and the way people are looking at i tunicles on our neglecting consonantal of these companies that that are designing posters design houses they may know what they get in their third trying to push the trampish for that kind of thing to work or you know they don't want to do that the exploding head design you know sometimes it the climate though and you have the council bit but you know you know but it is it is creeping into the main stream realisme you know you're starting to see our work like you know an inherent device had a great series of posters that look really their own if you don't dry had a lot of great you know official art behind it so you know like a lake it is it is there but i think they do it for a certain type of film to right a certain teofilo would they do which i think is good it works for me as though to
2536.35,2538.48, run posters
2539.2,2543.7, when the devil comes out manchoo shot kind of thing
2543.85,2546.49, right that's fine i get it
2546.82,2584.47, we have the ones that the hired artists to do for the festering as those of the books generally generated interest for writing sometimes those vessel a done that's where on to use that one yard and yes so you know it in cool when like you know cerinthia art becomes an official art or that posterity did that is coming from an illustrated place in the right you know it's coming from you know that kindheartedly trying to capture you know i think this documentary twenty four by thirty six is sartainly you know 
2584.62,2597.82, and the people behind them you know back in the address is on the move with you know back in like the you know wherever like all the way back to the forties and fifties you know oh you know artists ornamenting their work
2597.85,2601.24, but they would sign the poster but they would hide it
2602.95,2614.08, in there somewhere it's good to see that not you know the artists are getting a little yether getting a little recognition for their work too i mean imagine that
