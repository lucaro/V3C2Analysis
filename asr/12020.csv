4.59,11.13, many drovers think that the spade that travel is an important and traveling just above the speed limit isn't dangerous or risky
11.13,26.49, however even small increases in speed or an important factor in both the occurrence of road crashes and the severity of crashes while most drives now the dangers of high level speeding many of us don't understand that a few comatose the limit can also be dangerous
26.79,33.3, after all many people have travelled a little over the speed limit without crushing so easy to think that it's safe
33.42,34.47, not
34.83,42.48, authority set speed limits that level to limit the risk of a crash occurring however traveling at any spade involve some risk
42.54,50.82, speeding above that limit increases the risk further even if only traveling slightly above this is referred to as low level speeding
51.12,55.77, a small increase in speed doesn't affect my chance of a crash to it
56.04,62.13, because a lot of people speed a little bit and don't have a crash they may think that the chance of having a crash is an increased
62.13,77.7, it safety researches have found that traveling as little as five columns per our faster when in fact doubleyou chance of a casualty crash so traveling just a little faster can have disastrous consequences on the road for every one especially pedestrians and cyclists
78.03,88.26, studies have also showing that the increase in the chances of having a crash but trembling as little as five columns now faster is equivalent of having a blood alcohol level of point or five
88.71,96.0, if you look at the whole population if everyone doubles their chance of a casualty crushed by low level speeding it would double the road to
97.08,105.39, of course people who drive a dangerously high speed the much higher chance of a serious crash and obviously posed a much bigger risk for everyone
106.02,111.0, why does a small increase in speed increased my chances of a crash
111.66,117.72, small increases in spade have a surprisingly large fact on two main areas of crash avoidance
117.72,121.68, the reaction time of a driver and the breaking distance to stop
122.46,135.51, with small increases in spade when dropping slightly faster than the speed limit and encountering an emergency before the driver has even reacted and started to press the bright petal the cow will be closer to an impact
135.84,144.63, and obviously the faster a courage traveling the longer it would take to stop once the breaks have been applied even with small increases in spade
144.96,151.47, if you combine reaction time and breaking distance together the effect can be surprisingly large
152.04,159.63, look at the cars traveling next to each other one at sixty columbus parlour and the other at sixty five columns per hour
159.78,173.43, by the say and react to it has it on the road at the same time at the point where the car travelling sixty dolomites and now had stopped the car traveling sixty five columbus prois still travelling at over thirty columns parlour
174.09,183.3, if this incident involved a pedestrian and impact at a athirt columbanus parlour has a very high risk of serious injuries or even death
183.6,188.58, so how does a small increase in speed affected severity of a crash
188.73,192.66, sometimes the laws of physics acting was so don't expect
192.66,200.58, the energy of a crushed and hence the energy experience by some one involved in a crash is calculated by this equation
200.61,206.49, in the equation m as the mass of the car and very is the speed of the car
206.49,209.25, however the speed of the car is squared
209.79,214.71, this means that the energy increases dramatically for every increase in spade
214.95,223.14, example by just increasing the speed by five columns parlour the amount of energy in the crush increases by eighteen per cent
223.5,233.28, so what happens if we all slow down road saved researches have found that despite lower speed limits the average journey time barely changes at all
233.43,241.23, after reducing catharalis mantelets by columbus peru there were over twenty per cent fewer casualty crashes
241.77,246.51, you benslow down we can make the roads safe for every one
246.69,249.21, well that's the saving worth making
