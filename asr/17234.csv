78.21,80.79, he'll be successful in my mind
82.41,86.07, i think i've got everything we need for to morrow
90.21,125.55, other i forgot to be cruising out and says everything ready to day one of our troopers called us saying that he was travelling back last night and then he got trapped in a snow storm and now he is struggling to survive eating conover's and using his jacket as a blanket a which is why we are down a property
125.85,136.5, are slightly behind schedule the camera was falling and i caught with one hand there's only been like beginning three fights the london
136.92,156.69, like guy was out of hospital by and we were doing a shot where the broom was required to be lower and we had it on the ground for i had it on the ground i turned around and went to go at towards life and people were walking by and somebody hit it thus no way for me to have known that it was down there
157.02,226.47, and knocked off the head of the room and of feeling guilty at all knowing knows how to fix it icefall and he's going to have to pay for it i don't know how organdi really because pretty much in the worst experience my attire life aeronautics and early morning is raining is pretty nasty took a while at the first shot set up i think we spent about three hours to track it the first shot but he deftly made up for it and he shot after that and we wrapped the three three hours three four hours earlier his pretty freezing pretty much everybody on the shoot is pretty new at this
227.1,228.48, and
228.78,248.31, there is a learning curve going into it it's my first time doing this kind of thing i kind of felt congealed wondering hungering right i should be here there and in a unnerving it should be a little bit harder to morrow because we've got exteriors and we have to deal with whether in
248.64,250.83, a ring set
250.89,426.75, roughtor actors going to running a few minutes later and a trouble he was all the way in a short canongate hour drive and then we metaponto i was out a gas at the big directional of man proudfoot now was promised keeping the forewent the ottoman however thereanent to make movies that that make people think i don't want just a cheap thrill went on people to walk away asking helvetians
426.99,455.61, things have gone actually pretty well i think not without any trouble but i think pretty well well everything has been going fine when we stopped for lunch and came back afterward and the promises so that the dolomites there is pologniev dollars langdale a real cash
455.85,471.21, it's gone we use this camera technique called handmaidens as makes pretty crazy you actually hold the lands but in front right in front of 
471.33,473.28, the lenses in
473.31,499.56, you just kind of look a little little bit in it's a crazy focus of fact and we were trying to use that to simulate maybe a little upfling at the time those rapprocher went also and turns out the missing money was just 
499.65,544.38, the crew seemed to think that to day is going to be a simple shot it will be out here in forethought locations to shoot the night i think everybody just thinks it's going to be easy to any i hope that doesn't mean i think they're going to slap off in such to be philip because all the pressure is on half why all the pressure you know what i mean like i have no not me whatsoever like im resources to tell him what i want and if he doesn't do it then it's not my fault it's all filled because i told him what i wanted and he didn't do it nobody is going to blame me nobody e'se me my name's just at the end your face will be written across this horrible disaster
544.8,546.57, but it's a beautiful faith
546.63,574.41, eeeetoy when really good finally i feel like the crew has met their stride and were like doing things a lot faster i think you can tell how well
574.59,580.56, the shot went by how angry i gave into dancing at all so you know it's been a good day
582.12,584.64, and i like to morrow as cannon
584.79,590.43, challenging to morrow the pomegranate
590.49,593.55, one of the hardest if not estate among
593.67,595.53, i even know what's happening right now
595.62,625.83, cold there's chances of dresden alienating a forelock of morning or suppose i try to get a light open the roof tops or we don't have epopees or sheeting down town and get all in dark or building a door somehow in out of nothing i'm sort of expecting a lot of lakeland a lot of people to be like one of the donor
625.83,790.23, tomorrow farthermore is production it's about fifteen twenty minutes pass round a routine and we are missing about half the class challenges to night are going to be keeping the bombs and drunker we really can't get started with much until all the cards are out of the way all the lights set up some cottage astounding we saw was the nineteenth parthenogenesis finished her last night of shooting here on produce first a shooting turenne chickens with their heads cut off pretty much in the worst experience when a tired life was dashing people are an around like they knew it there doing like the season prose was probably the best experience of my life i learned a lot through film collie actually going through the classes and everything like that but i think that there are suffavean inside the classroom which makes this project just such a great learning experience of such great learning tool i mean it has been a great experience over all i personally believe this was a once in a life time opportunity i had the chance to take what i was learning in class and i was kind of forced to learn it out in the field that's how i learn i learned by doing and seeing for myself letting it could have gone wrong didn't think the lower really i mean i can't think of a better better way to in my freshman year
