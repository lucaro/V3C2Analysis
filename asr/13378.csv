6.93,11.61, an excellent introduction actually some of you may have had an age i use had any before
11.82,18.45, sometimes the circumstances out so positive but may be in a research situation as well what about any former
19.77,60.39, the heart give her both a hard times the i mean the so noisy to be in our thoughts but the hand up narsac project once to be in infirmarian really it was so loud i couldn't really concentrate on what they were trying to get me to do any way we look thank you for that feel and lettuce to shame and before we proceed because on the screen over here you'll see we've got shame windup describe the device that you looked up to and what its telling us so that then what you'll be on to do its trap shames response as we proceed to day go for
63.18,73.32, a company called a motive and what you say is there's about sixteen different electrodes surrounding my head and as filleting up signals
73.59,76.08, the motive company has
76.35,80.85, developed a range of algorithms to
80.94,89.67, make sure that the edges being processed in a certain way and they've come up what were showing here in the screen is is supposedly three measures
89.79,114.69, one is supposed to be frustration hasn't looking all would suspect that a report or not frustrated but frustration is also you know related to heighten inside or excitement other sorts of descriptions of of that sort of emotional the red one which is not being picked up because as i'm talking
115.95,136.32, mention that in so when i'm talking the muscles in my mouth removing their causing a lot of noise in the ensigns to watch the red one man to tell it is supposed to be engagement or how engaged i am and that's measuring a type of eagle balantyre of albany which we commonly measure
136.44,167.82, the lower one is instantaneous excitement again i looked a look like i'm not a very sinister very anxious or to death and very disengaged walcott's your job it tell us your story because you run this company in a true which is a seductive title is that what you're getting at in it the inner truth
168.87,179.34, look i alike the name and and came up with the name along with my business partners well mainly probably coming from my friends in background
179.58,192.75, and working with the sort of pathological side of the human behind her and again using micro expression analysis if everyone sees the show to me
192.81,224.55, i did that sort of training and use that in the forensic system that's watching the very mindanao say with the somerset their fresh bread or angry they'll do interesting things like squeeze their hand or cap their food or their linacer ain way thiennette i started to use a lot of that previous forensic work to actually when i was facilitating focus groups
224.73,232.17, if people were actually comfortable with their responses to what were they were signing response to an air or a product or
232.29,241.08, a prince or a brand or whatever it was we were testing so from there my undergraduate degree in nearside
241.17,252.03, lead me to to look at the opportunity of using psychophysiological measures such as e g to help us better understand
252.06,253.8, consumer responses
254.1,260.7, both in the space where often people kept articulate why they like something
260.76,264.78, versus when they can easily identify what they like
264.81,270.18, often when it comes to advertising or pack is on we ask somebody
270.21,276.72, how much do you like like that in an a focus group to say i don't like the color radiant like the print
277.17,283.32, necessarily help an advertising agency preside they are looking for an emotional response
283.59,299.43, to get that sort of understanding so let's to came to be that interpret is about using both what people say they like but also using the physiological measures to actually make sure that they're actually coming together to make sure that
299.52,308.4, companies a work with are actually creating value for customers as well as the company themselves and getting that
308.61,317.1, relationship established so when when i first met you are actually was surprised to find that there was an euramerican
317.55,325.17, australia because it is such a fledgeling field isn't it so it give us a sense of who your clients are
325.29,345.66, sort of questions that they want answered yes well for example every cent study i just did it for a global advertising agency and what they're trying to understand is the different types of advertising in that how engaging that is so for example we all see at the moment on television the
345.78,360.87, i say there are knowing brainpower as for you yet it's like an informer shall basically or some one on the screen of the martin grallatores or the most annoying at toonie's something like the
360.96,367.86, boats draft and where they tell a story in engaging they take you on a bit of a journey about what the
367.98,382.53, the brand is tried to deliver to its customers so their trying to understand well what actually adds are most engaging to consumers by on on that stall of advertising because as an advertising agent say
382.77,385.29, about trying to create
385.71,393.27, on the consumers want to see what to engage with which will then help when there at that supermarket shelf
393.45,413.01, got an option of five i really like that and so i might consider that andrea one night people feel good ultimately you can engage them that whether or not that translates to actually someone picking the product of the shell from buying a hollow the question is it 
413.04,416.49, in the very controlled laboratory environment
416.61,427.29, the father the kids were not at the shops i got seven year old twins planned direction of three and a half year old twisted half year old pollinate direction sometimes it's just
427.29,441.87, he know all this grahame on just to get out of the alans even though we're strong to base predicts going to be most engaging and get that purchasing decision
441.87,446.22, put on that high level of a consideration said
446.31,456.9, still it's the laboratory versus real world let's just get a quick into to the side that your exploiting so dispose what instruments are you using
456.9,459.03, to help your clients
459.21,466.29, we currently used as we use to this one it's you can see it's not necessarily that reliable
466.29,488.25, so you're not still anxious for the eiffel editione get up and take the man that so we do shefford would have seen some of the athenians
488.46,498.48, so we use that type of engine used jail a type of conductive jail in it to the electorate spots in order to ensure the repeating dodinas
498.51,515.58, well as in fishing we use our tracking as well so we can get up a good measure of what people are actually looking at as well as what the the braines eclares ponding to we measure those two together to try to get an understanding of what part of that stimulus is actually
515.58,517.74, correlated with that
517.74,529.65, the confident in the science because we use in technology that you find in any hospital
530.19,552.39, can't speak for everyone out there but the silence were used definitely his will come to that nightshirts and nero tosh as they can before we come to peter let's have paid on the screen showed us because your flat lining and agitating i think patriotic more interesting heart there pathetical i come to you first though i mean
553.11,569.46, people advertising agencies have reached out to technology for decades in that i mean the years i've been reaching out to try and find some new tall sometimes dimmycrat they do so
569.46,587.61, just explain that trajectory of the now we're in a very weaver different errand you think with branches and i guess higher resolution device i think there's a number of factors that applying to it because the notes of the dickerin
588.15,603.57, briathrach mistress and this a number of facts that came together in betterton by ways that in fact a book that i mention it tonometer was a hugely red book
603.84,606.03, his message of
606.3,634.41, and as people have make decisions we need to when they to connect with them in some other way to understand really what people are thinking and that message really spread through the marketing community that took that message to hear i guess another part of the time in hotels that a lot of this technology is early now really becoming a garrison of the lab
634.53,635.73, the hospital
636.09,662.16, it's becoming more widely used by a company such as shines where where is it wasn't previously there an element of an forgive me boys with their tastes to be induced by new and neutralising device shannon but it really progressing i mean what would about the good old fashioned ask some one that the focus group
662.46,685.89, and that that the core of the problem that is his research from the lab showing us that when we do focus groups look there's a lot of very deep and relevant nation that we can go on from fourteenth deceive you an answer and they will do their very very best give you an honest answer
686.1,712.23, often it is just not true and it appears that we have systems had wide into us that filling the gaps that when unconscious processing actually results in a certain kind of decision we entemena turn explanation that make sense to us about why we made the decisions we did and so make guesses what he called the left brain interpret which makes sense of the things we do
712.23,713.82, after one the
714.18,730.59, that's tentata may come out with a whisperless in control of her thoughts than perhaps we think we are this there's a lot bubbling away entire that were not out for sure well let's come to our neurosis to bother head patala
732.72,735.45, we can't i didn't think we could
735.51,737.88, and we can we through the pages
738.12,743.31, there you go like a beautiful good
743.52,744.72, we 
745.74,752.31, houston for you i mean how toward extent 
752.64,765.06, what proportion of our cognition or thinking is unconscious because this is extraordinary what chinanpin is true and all for low is going on in the nether world with a brain that we really don't
765.06,768.21, but possibly have any control of
770.28,781.5, i think that it's very hard to put a number on it while i could speculate about numbers but there's no question that there is a significant amount of cognitive
781.68,793.47, that goes on in the brain to which we are incapable of assessing that that all sorts of things happen
793.56,820.68, without a conscious awareness of an anti you think about it if you just walk down the street there's a tremendous amount of computation that goes on just to organize your balance in your limbs moving appropriately and you never think about those sort of things you can think consciously about it but that's a urmand's mount of computational effort which goes on
820.89,825.78, determined that we used consciously it's not completely clear what that
825.99,832.08, means in neurological terms but certainly there is a lot of
832.11,836.22, activity that goes on in that realm
836.43,837.93, in the interesting
837.93,847.47, with respect to the north kinds of things that were discussing this evening yes it's evening there 
848.13,872.52, really how much those events affect our decisions and this becomes really a annora thing to think about is actually kind of a deep philosophical issue and in something that is impact very important to each and every one of us the degree to which
872.67,923.16, we are making decisions that are our ears that are authenticated as ours or were making decisions that are affected by the world around us and the truth of the matter is that every day we make decisions that are some mixture of those two i would like to say that all of my decisions are entirely my own but i am quite aware that that would be a falsehood and now with deep understanding of the underlying nursie some inroads are being made into both understanding that underlying moral circuitry and ways of atnenophis
923.22,926.28, concerned now with the ethical questions
926.58,928.14, by
928.32,939.63, the nuisances and development in the near or science and so how how do you come at this growth in romarin as a nurse and as an epic
940.32,955.29, well so i think that the issues that we grapple with and you know within the field of neurotics we we struggle with this issue as much as everybody else is the degree to which
955.32,956.82, in
957.09,977.46, even if you put aside the height if it's carried to his logical conclusion the extent to which it threatens a concept that pretty much everybody understands but the philosophers have spent a long time thinking about called autonomy and autonomy is literally self rule
977.67,996.69, that ability for an individual to make a decision themselves and there's a traditionally sort of letter many models but the standard model of autonomy would run something like this that we have both higher order beliefs and desires and lower order
996.78,1003.44, and some of those lower order desires all might be well i am sitting here talking
1003.47,1006.65, to this audience i want to 
1006.71,1028.46, appear intelligent that would be my high order desire but in the meantime i might i've been having a couple of cups of tea to keep me up and so i might actually have to go to the bathroom for the sonneteer or desire and there's a conflict there between my desire to remain in touch with my audience and my bodies
1028.49,1042.05, a desire to eliminate this some way we will come to have a toilet break if you are desperate or any potentate bedecorated but so what i decide to do the
1042.47,1045.08, in the end is
1045.14,1072.44, thought to require the front of part of my brain my pre frontal curtain particular to make the decision of what i'm going to do so in this particular case i am a relatively rational intact cheatit what's called cognitive control of ongoing to sit here and kind of tough it out talk to you should the next hour but 
1072.5,1088.64, would be possible to tap into those lower order desires which are their called created desires and then the hot hirondelle or desires and make them more urgent
1088.7,1097.37, he became more indistinct on the example of an everybody has had that experience but the commonest decision
1097.55,1103.76, really important part of this is that for a decision to be autonomous it really needs to be one that
1103.79,1108.38, my front court ultimately decides and not
1108.41,1116.57, so lower level unconscious desire feeding into the decision to
1116.75,1131.96, such a degree that i lose control and somebody else gains control that is a real threat to autonomy so you say a future when near a marketing might tide our unconscious desires
1132.17,1135.2, in ways that we might not be aware of
1135.38,1141.11, or realize or want but hasn't the islet what marketing people of always been doing
1141.77,1170.12, so there's no question that's what martin that's the whole point that of marking that's why there's some tension here in terms of thinking about this and it's perfectly reasonable for the market for business to do whatever they can to select where this becomes a problem will and and it was kind of interested in and fills presentation is
1170.33,1184.22, when it moves over to something that we've turned stealth nor marketing and so steal nor marketing would be where a product is indeed with certain characteristics that
1185.75,1197.42, it's hard to imagine forcing you but that make this statistical likelihood of your decision being to buy that product so high then you're likely to buy it
1197.87,1220.55, yet you're completely unable to ever know that that is a that that influence is ever been there because it's one thing to make a decision when presented with arrangement and even if your influence in some way but if you're not able to know at all then you really lose control over the game
1220.79,1235.25, it is a game a sort and within that that's really where things become kind of need into sort of this uncanny valley of being created where you know i don't
1235.28,1249.17, i want somebody else to decide which kind of tomato soup on going to bar or if in going to buy tomatas at all i actually would like that decision to be mine that i would like
1249.26,1253.76, everybody to be able to make the decision for themselves
1253.85,1257.09, with all of the appropriate 
1257.45,1259.46, constraint on
1259.55,1264.77, you know that business is allowed to do it what they are allowed to do
1264.83,1293.45, this kitchen to kind of funny territory willy territories in it because to what extent do we so many influences there are so many influences on while we buy what we do what we choose to do every day feel i think you've got a response and what do you and can too what do you think of those concerns that pay to hers and his colleagues in the sort of nero ethics community that may be there's a future where will overstep the line and compromise
1294.35,1302.0, tomlinson is i don't think the gal of nearly all the golf marketing
1302.03,1309.38, about manipulations i mentioned earlier and the reason for that is i think appetite
1309.44,1331.61, perhaps organizations focused on efficient production and sale take ages to generate profit but after the fifties has been a shifty what marking is all about and the idea of the marketing orientation and anagnia ion that is making our antics one that is focused on bringing that the effort of the holliston together to meet and leaders
1331.85,1347.36, because in the end that is what draws the long term relationship with a customer if i manipulate a custom i may have some short term benefit if i can do that and i think that's questionable that with or can do that but if i manipulate i get one sale
1347.78,1360.41, what happens after that is the custom of these a huge man in decision making that occurs after the purchases made and that's all about my satisfaction had i gained the benefits that i sought to achieve
1360.41,1379.07, my hand all these things go on after the fact and if those needs are not met her i i got back i will go either to competitor or some other kind of product and so the idea of manipulating obviously sometimes marketing sells products that we don't need or want until we enter we hold that we want them
1380.06,1391.01, that's publication scatter point that i want to make his entertainer a marketing in still
1391.13,1399.8, the manipulative features because i think near marinate talked about to day is all about getting a raid on people it's not about putting something in
1399.83,1407.45, actually i'm understanding how people respond to something so we need any criticisms we could live all that were currently
1407.96,1429.29, linking with near a marking i think it were really just talking about the tent criticisms of marketing as a whole so it interesting that i shinnied a mean you're getting a raid on people but in this case you're getting a raid on people in a way that tells you something about them that they perhaps don't ever know themselves shohat do you you think about that
1430.25,1436.1, the started taste marketing question i think it going back to
1437.87,1452.3, sort of autonomy i look at more from mild philosophy of the mind as a union you know it's comparing free will versus determinism so do we have free will in our decision making or is everything determined by external forces
1452.3,1462.86, now lie lincluden from morphology from lack inhuman and there army was well that's just it a verbal in semantic debate about free willers
1462.86,1466.61, it more round understanding that
1466.64,1473.57, human beings we have this frontal cortex that allows us to at any point time stall
1474.14,1476.54, the decisions that were making
1476.6,1480.83, we don't have that capability than we going to have a different discussion
1482.0,1515.06, from this standpoint i think that is an important discussion to have because we know from nurse that not everybody has that capability such as young children my company would never do research on young children some with thy would nay i would suspect that some some potentially that the kids in a scanner and say what what they respond to thinness then we start to to touch across the the often debate well it's that state versus personal freedom to make her own decisions and
1515.27,1530.63, much parental control and much parental responsibilities it over the children too to help them learn to make the right decision as a psychologist as we spend half my clinical practice on his teaching people on hadamard decisions when they were making the
1530.81,1539.81, decisions based on an inability to understand them in emotional states so but from there are more heating stamp pointed
1539.81,1559.25, look at it as i feel said you know i could ask if this was a case focused upon it as everyone who do you you feel the temperature of the room is and probably get different answers where is it be just easier for me to use the other moment or to get in more of an accurate measure
1559.4,1579.5, i'm sort of saying well from a perspective and there are lots of limitations to what we can actually do with the sum of which i feel touched upon and the differences between mine
1579.59,1590.06, he sized bone nescience theory that this is what's likely happen i would never do under a morning study no i count on my my client on this
1590.48,1602.54, an understanding how people use products while would i want to get somebody's primrose on how to use products i just ask them you know if i want to know how they using a vacuum satanow often
1602.72,1606.14, there are certain areas which have highly impractical
1606.2,1614.78, actually majoring i mean what what's the connection that you're making between what you measure in the age
1614.81,1625.04, and what you then tell your client about whether a product working or not or whether in addis working if you tracking it in time so what sort of brainwave are you picking up on and what does that tell you
1625.04,1635.48, and that always comes back to the objectives of what the study is so for example from from an advertising study it might be if it's a fifteen second and
1635.51,1638.27, i do minute long and
1639.14,1642.56, to recognize that to run a mine or on television 
1642.86,1655.91, expensive sixty minutes such a circumstance second lecanius very expressive misty second and is very expensive so far and tell them
1656.12,1659.06, seconds out you know noose your audience
1660.2,1661.49, an important
1662.06,1669.62, for the buttons what would ye be tracking with an orange
1669.68,1672.38, just a measure of engagement
1672.41,1677.0, bongrand that's looking at 
1677.15,1685.01, the whole power spectrum of the different waves as well as a positive and negative sort of response
1685.01,1704.36, from the approach sort of withdrawal response for the pretore we more likely to an approach a stimulus or we more likely to withdraw from that stimulus and in fact that is it in the brine into him as two different hemispheres quite differently doesn't it it's kind of a positive association with the
1704.39,1711.02, lift frontier in a sensitive withdrawing effect on the right side the cry
1711.14,1715.4, and that tells you you that tells you what you think i need to hear
1715.58,1718.64, he absolutely in because often if
1718.88,1726.23, what we're finding in our studies for example if we're a company heard us to do a location
1726.38,1727.25, and
1727.4,1742.07, different concepts or an anthro focus groups as you do by the twelfth loganshaw descend in feels like ulietea by the twelfth low people are bloody souls to attentive lover trying to pick what they liked the slivers
1742.13,1748.52, when we actually look at this while when you combine those two things together what people say they lie
1748.73,1760.22, well as measuring the brain edged you can get absolute clarity about which logally is likely to be the best one to go with an installation
1760.58,1766.22, of dollars even remembers the and i loved using the monthly climes
1766.34,1767.75, be
1768.5,1775.01, napier one sort of in the public and thinks that that
1775.97,1784.46, a large part costantino in like that
1784.88,1805.91, i can and the sales of remould never have covered that the cat straight to the chase by cutting to the brain is your idea of soprano we come to you what your take on the science that being used by nero marketing at this point in time is it right enough is it ready enough
1806.06,1808.73, the sort of exportation in the market
1811.1,1813.95, actually to be perfectly honest for the
1814.67,1819.02, minor atheistically quite pleased with how
1819.35,1833.96, to some tree unripe the science is so one thing that i like to tell people that there is really the kinds of concerns that we have about real stealth nor marketing that somebody can get in there and
1834.2,1835.43, control your
1835.58,1852.89, so precisely in the science is nowhere near that well developed by i think that the insight that comes from the achaicus is a technology that's been rung for many years but is it hence considerably with
1852.98,1862.16, modern computer analysis that can be applied to these ways forms and from mary to see the
1862.46,1883.22, limited degree are very very intriguing but really we're not quite at the fine gray nuance level then we might want it get to in order to get the deeper insight than we really want but you know the reality is that
1886.31,1887.63, we lost 
1887.87,1897.86, in the nearing field have been refining and there is this thing that at an it always surprised at me then he nor marketing
1899.75,1903.59, discuss this notion of theory of may
1903.62,1920.84, more as when we look at other people we we infer many many things about their state of mind lying on the tongue are they angry or the sad do they intend to do this or did they not intend to
1920.84,1953.6, do this and so our brains are very naturally attuned to understand human brains quite well and the what the newmarket ing is trying to do is to get at no one of that and i think that it valiant effort i think that they're going to make a lot of progress there not quite where where they may want to be yet but i have no doubt he'll get there patadyon your colleges have written quite extensively calling for a code of ethics
1953.78,1958.52, the roaring emerging nearer marketing industry so
1958.52,1963.86, then some of the artisan that code of ethics what would it look like and what the impetus
1964.67,1987.83, so the impetus of having a code of ethics is really that the challenge here is one where all of this activity goes on outside of any regulatory framework and if one has concerns about any of these issues in
1987.83,2001.06, really i like to see actually the industry itself self regulated or begin to sign on to a cottian among the things that are
2001.51,2014.92, sort of trivial it seems but perhaps not entirely so it private companies when they got through the kinds of testing that they go through
2015.01,2066.07, the outside of the umbrella of the informed consent and so the setter research subjects that they include in their experiments at least in north mercadet how it works in australia but i have sung it the same sort of thing that the research subjects are or required to provide informed consent and that has been the standard in human experimental research within that that's actually but a simple and useful thing for companies too to do on which he bases to protect their research subjects as we would protect them in any sort of research experiment and that this because the clinchers let's covering things like what happened if you have any fear or an aged something untoward is discovered
2066.28,2076.21, there's a whole sort of state of protocols around how you would manage that do you tell the person that they've got a brain chinee all their coming is to do and study
2076.51,2080.26, that's exactly right and as you know my colleague
2080.26,2109.78, then a lot of work on developing those particles for how people in in the experimental situation deal with those kinds of incident findings lateral clear what would happen if similar discoveries made in a private company or what or really to be perfect what their responsibility is given that they are operating outside of the legal structures of consent 
2110.5,2128.02, so interested in putrescence shikaree about cooeth being development i know there's been a bit of a push in the us to try this for your industry or australia we've got this train market and social research aside which has a strong cooeth
2128.02,2132.07, both covering informed consent
2132.19,2148.06, a study that my company does there's two levels of importance the first stages at the recruitment face so when the recruitment company call somebody to participate their explained everything that's going to happen should they wish to
2148.09,2149.68, to participate
2149.68,2157.84, and then they when they actually come to the study themselves they have an information sheet which they are for they are forced to richly sit down read it
2158.23,2166.33, as well as saint tatastha completely understand what the actual study is about and what types they going to happen to them
2166.42,2176.05, probably over the top of magatha my psychologist ethics in and principles coming to work but our company as those two levels of informed 
2176.8,2180.7, that's clearly the case so
2180.94,2208.15, and you don't have to be a member of the strain market social research to say to be a practicing montresor company so that's an issue in itself the society camping out with the near satanow certainly the legal profession for example is facing some of the same challenges you know all of a sudden brain can evidence is making its way into the courts and pelagon
2208.3,2210.88, on trying to
2210.88,2222.37, in the society to start to look into it a bit more to see if there is something that we need to add to the code of ethics and guard lines and practice
2222.52,2224.89, for newmarket research
2224.89,2242.35, he will be looking at that into the future absolutely feel what's your take on a kind of ethics and we want you to get your questions and comments ready and raring to go we're going to get a bit roving around in a titan's absolutely critical i think it must be done as an academic
2242.38,2280.39, as you be aware they are very rigorous legal protocols surrounding the races that we do whether it's nearing racecourse donnot of a computer to do some kind of task and i think some of the sustentation is a question about what is done with that distracted
2280.66,2284.11, and is that aroused for other purposes after the fact
2284.2,2293.89, and now that one of the interest one of the interests of large nearing companies is to build up some kind of dardistan their collected
2293.89,2296.95, cause post how to choose some other goal
2297.04,2304.72, we really need to look closely at this consolation what about nero hat because i mean pater
2304.93,2306.31, both
2306.49,2317.71, i saw it a damage canebat also the marketing sector damage as well to get your comments on that but paid or what to your take on on some of the high around the nearer signs in different fields

2465.37,2470.68, for a perspective as an owner of a company that does know marker
2472.66,2481.18, i read so much in the press and what the media reports you know there's always papers coming out of the use of
2481.36,2492.67, some company reporting some outrageous sort of fun is defying spot absolutely the
2492.85,2504.73, now and constantly my lines are asking me will kick can we find except can we find while another basically so well know you can you can't this is what you can do
2504.73,2506.71, this is what she cannot do
2507.46,2509.17, search
2510.31,2517.06, and it's an education process and he comes back to the responsibility of the newmarket research companies
2517.39,2518.68, to
2518.8,2523.27, the customers on what they actually by
2523.3,2525.79, and i can speak
2525.85,2550.03, company out there that they're going to do that they and transparent with transparency as well having been a friend a psychologist like another not there are the nazarite are feathered not here not to night
