0.18,26.97, martindale's thirty or time no one's going to be writing a fight in amsterdam
27.3,44.82, you know the cars the future the businessman political parties were all for so the cars templemore a city in the nineteen sixties where were standing there in cars parked absolutely everywhere fairly shargar from where i'm standing right now at all what a lot of people don't know we've been where you've been
45.0,49.17, car which were everything you know cars were progress
49.2,55.71, they try to build a highway through the downtown area you know and a lot of kids got killed and traffic
55.98,63.99, and half way to see people here said no more it was too much so they rose up and they made a change for the better
63.99,76.98, as it was just unacceptable this is a special spot and answered it is right as an echo the citizens behind the camera you see the narrow seats of the city center grade you see a wide profile
77.31,78.66, had been widened
78.69,82.53, i was in the s to make this toast
82.59,85.14, that it would connect toward
85.38,88.68, it around the city center or place here
89.25,90.63, of course
90.81,93.18, all the city sent could be
93.3,107.25, i reached my car but the people in incidental what should happen but it has to happen to make this a six line car street than you have to break down house over there and even further and fill in parts of the canals
107.55,118.92, so many people were opposed this plan in nineteen seventy two early ninety cent it was in the city council is part of the plan was rejected and that
119.67,120.6, the end was
120.66,128.46, the end of the old traffic plan for the city to people realize oh this thing with every one owning a car in the city and so working in
128.46,132.33, their polluting their noisy is just no room for them all
132.6,148.29, the dangerous so that the tide began to turn in the inner canal rings of antonelli where we are here
149.49,155.97, a lot of shared space in terms of pedestrians cars bicycles
157.29,161.16, easy it works the cars aren't
161.31,171.87, so fast and the whites aren't even going that fast either so everyone takes turns every one is nice and civilized about it on the main arterial road it's a different story
172.11,176.46, the cars are driving much faster and so there is a street cycle paths
176.49,187.74, and between six and eight feet in width and cyclists than have a straight shot to wherever they're going and their protected because they are on a raised lycopodiums built
187.95,192.21, utilitarian cyclists for grandma's for little kids
192.39,211.02, in popular executives for whoever is writing their pike and the riding of simplifying fast and people show a lot of respect especially if your writing is bearded misbegotten in antenatal it's also a very busy cartesian underneath that the petrolite
211.08,211.92, you
211.92,215.91, now i encircles a crossing this tension
215.94,217.53, high numbers
217.74,218.46, then
218.52,233.01, to stop because the cars are coming and these cars let me think on this many many more parts than you have bicycles with is not solemnities to and here in one city second hand cars are crossing in the other direction
233.04,242.1, one and a half minutes so that you see the tiger animosity for a city is that you have very high a capacity of people
242.4,245.43, i bike and if they go by car
245.52,269.28, people do anticipate better than any other place you'll see because it's so busy crowded in a small space before have a six cents for what's going on around them they have a very good special awareness intently see sacristan fit in a small space
269.49,272.31, i need a space well to balance
272.34,279.24, the capable tintings are not clear they may go shake it's very interesting to see
279.27,292.2, but the best way to see it is to experience it yourself i have signals you don't see them amsterdam sites don't stick their arms out they don't do this to go away you don't see that kind of thing they make a settle a little gesture
292.23,297.24, go right in on left and everybody understands that and people adjust and
297.42,314.73, i spent so much time on a plank it's no big deal of somebody bumps the handlebar against your hip or something like that you not get scared you say excuse me sure it afflicted like this would be considered extremely dangerous in the us cause its uncontrolled there are no subsides no traffic alter the course was this does look like chaos
315.09,320.91, but the man at all works everyone does with their food at actually when you see something not working here
321.51,322.65, i would say
322.83,326.37, at times it's because it's a tourist on a bike
326.49,328.92, where there are no traffic lights
328.92,336.03, really much more in touch with all the other cyclists on the road and with the drivers as well people look at each other and there in your eyes
336.12,346.86, you make your hand signals you are much more in touch with humanity on your bike then i think anywhere else in the world for an outsider to come in and see what the dutch of doing
347.07,365.7, creates a very weird war perception about what it takes to become a cycle city when first came here that he every first thing i did for i even arranged housing before i had
365.79,371.37, groceries before i go directest i went and bought cheap second hand the secret bicycle
371.37,377.76, and i just jumped in a wanted to see what it was like to ride a bike here and now wasn't a shock
377.82,378.96, it was
379.14,415.98, it was a surprise and i have to say even after years of being a bike racer in riding in the peleton who rubbing elbows with every body was very strange to be on upright bike in street clothes riding through the streets of corning up north elba elbow with regular people going to work going to school with their kids with their groceries wherever and shamelessly flowing through the world on bicycles i lived in the bay area for about six years and in berkeley high bred commuter bike for nearly everything but my household had two cars for two people
416.31,426.96, here we have three bikes for two people and no cars when a furtive an intimate goodmorning teammate school it came through the right museum tunnel over there
427.68,431.1, and when i came out and i got to the sinister somebody cyclists that 
431.13,435.36, i need to count but i can't any
435.51,437.76, one little tiny space
437.94,482.28, minutes that was enough for me i hope that when bucellas me might have to leave the american i said because i saw nine hundred twenty seven cyclists and twenty minutes of course the decorated the head pinwheel what big deal there one time throughout my book is then the skies the reputation of arsenicalis adamastor reputations men anarchistic side continued to let that transliterated to a jam what they did but there was what fifths power and numbers edomites there is all of how anarchistic and activities were
482.49,486.96, the life that centred up to the present day this
486.96,488.37, sides of the
488.37,489.3, the
489.48,492.06, i guess amazing things you see people doing
492.21,521.97, in amsterdam like thing for one these people have grown up on bicycles they've been interprets by since their babies and their riding every day of their life public lacordere good by criers and second it is human nature people do what they're going to do people drive cars talking on phones carrying stuff tending to their screaming kids in the back seat and they're going to do exactly camping on bikes here the big differences on a bike rider makes a mistake and remsen to something he probably only hurt himself
522.0,526.17, and nobody else and were not murderous does if they take out a store
526.5,527.94, sidewalk full of people
527.97,536.79, it's not that necessarily the kind of bit culture where people are very aware of that they have a culture abroad a bi culture is usually a subculture
536.82,544.68, acknowledgment of sub culture as in it stand out because not many people do it here it's so ingrained it so part of every day life
545.19,549.48, if you tell a dutch person like oh you have such a nice bite culture
549.48,550.2, i
550.2,552.45, you mean because of such person
552.63,559.98, think of by culture is something sub cultural as well you have a bicture when you're on a fixed or on a beesting like that
560.13,561.96, it's kind of strange
562.02,563.55, contradiction
563.85,568.86, it's something so normal so ingrained into everyday life that
570.03,572.19, nobody treats it as something special
573.72,574.8, life is
575.19,581.31, my kids once or twice every day is probably the high light of the day it's really fun
581.37,584.07, i manister maybe a month old
584.52,605.16, first an opiate later sitting in the hand as in an bars an by an bye and they see how it all works anticlea how the flow works in the hope where to go when to go left when to go right at the track of chaffing work and how the whole interaction and system works so now pascalon almost five
605.28,625.35, pertly confident little city sidewinder
