363.54,585.51, he oesterreichischer etiennette teetotallers aeternitatis
585.81,596.46, have you ever felt haunted hunted have you felt like god was after you
596.7,603.87, have you ever felt that god was absolutely determined to have god's way with you no matter what
603.96,605.79, like it or not
606.45,607.68, most
607.8,636.0, some thirty nine felt that way have you ever felt being dragged kicking and screaming and to god's plan for your life have you been called to preach have you been called to simply witness in a way that was uncomfortable for you or perhaps you've been called to make your confession of faith and say out loud in front of everybody yes i believe that jesus really is the christ and that made you uncomfortable
636.36,638.1, you felt called
638.1,645.33, even when you wanted to be left alone felt the frustration and the hopelessness of fighting god
646.86,651.0, you ever felt that way you are in good company
651.27,658.44, a common theme in scripture jonah was called by god to go to geneva
658.53,659.67, the east
659.73,675.33, a tornado straight west as fast as he could go as called to be a prophet said i am not a prophet i am not the son of a prophet amos wanted to be left alone to be a shepherd of his sheep
675.45,682.77, the language a most used in resisting or trying to resist god's call the lion has roared
682.92,687.9, who can but fear the lord god has spoken
688.2,712.83, can but speak in other words amos thought he had just about as much choice in the matter of accepting or rejecting god's call as you were i would have choice in the matter of whether or not we will fear when we are in the presence of a roaring lion moses used his own inability as an excuse i am slow of speech
713.04,727.83, called moses anyway in first corinthians paul describes the same kind of feeling he says necessity is laid upon me woe to me if i do not preach
729.69,730.83, in the garden
731.19,733.65, this cup pass from me
734.37,737.37, crosses not use friendly my friends
737.73,741.69, there is no resurrection without crucifixion
741.96,743.67, but even jesus
744.09,747.81, as wanted to resist god's call
747.84,751.08, there was a marvellous quote from carl bart
751.17,754.02, german theologian of the fifties
754.02,756.6, who says to the preacher
757.14,761.4, as to the one who wants to preach he says you there
761.64,764.31, the word of god on our lips
764.88,766.59, how dare you
768.0,772.98, then karl barred answers his own question by saying you dare not
773.67,775.62, yet you must
776.28,814.98, jeremiah in the passage were going to look at to day says almost the same kind of thing in jeremiah chapter twenty it's an absolutely beautiful passage i believe and jeremias situation is this he has challenged the high priest pasture he has challenged his entire society in jerusalem by preaching the word that god wanted him to preach it has made people mad jeremiah has been arrested he has been thrown in the dungeon he been put in the stocks and ridiculed publicly and jeremiah has said
815.16,824.07, with this i'm not going to do this any more and he resolves that he is not going to preach in god's name any more
825.33,830.25, listen to the language because the next morning
830.49,833.7, comes out and despite his resolve
834.9,837.18, begins to preach again
837.51,847.44, now listen to the language that cherami uses here listen to how frustrated he seems to be resisting god's will
847.62,852.57, discovering that god is stronger than is its germinate twenty
852.6,877.02, seven through thirteen old lord you have deceived me and i was deceived you have overpowered me and you have prevailed i have become a laughing stock all day long every one mocks me for whenever i speak i must cry out i must shout violence and destruction for the word of the lord has become for me
877.02,886.62, reproach and a derision all day long if i say i will not mention god or speak any more in his name
886.68,912.48, then there is within me something like a burning fire shut up in my bones i am weary with holding it in and i cannot i hear people whispering terror is all around denounce him let us denounce him my close friends are watching me to stumble perhaps he can be deceived and we can prevail against him and take our revenge on him
913.71,915.87, the lord is with me
915.99,938.67, a red warrior therefore my persecutors will stumble and they will not prevail they will be greatly shamed for they will not succeed their eternal dishonour will never be forgotten o lord of hosts tesque the righteous you see the heart and the mind let me see your retribution upon them
939.03,941.61, to you i have committed my case
941.91,943.35, sam to the board
943.47,944.85, praise the lord
944.97,947.76, he has delivered the life of the needy
947.97,951.45, from the hands of the evil doers
952.35,980.01, a marvelous passage jeremiah expressing his anger at away for imposing upon jeremiah's life his frustration with the task nothing had gone as he had planned he felt betrayed and deceived by god one translation of scripture even uses the word seduced there he is angry he frustrated he has better and he's out in the open about it
980.34,988.5, most of us do not have the kind of relationship with god that jeremiah had most of us sometimes do get angry with god
988.65,994.08, we're not likely to say it out loud i know who we think we're fooling
994.35,999.51, perfectly well how we really feel but jeremiah
999.69,1001.67, speak out loud
1001.67,1008.48, expressive his anger his relationship with god is such that he can be angry with god
1008.54,1014.78, still love and obey his relationship with god is such that he can disagree
1015.05,1016.97, still follow
1017.54,1022.34, a very special kind of relationship very special kind of friendship
1023.66,1035.99, i can almost hear as cherami resolves to keep quiet and then is unable to do so i can almost hear awaiting i never promised you a rose garden
1037.22,1061.04, god does do however is give certain promises and jeremiah recognizes that even in his frustration jeremiah acknowledges that when his enemies come against him god is a warrior by his side and will confound his enemies and the passage ends with a beautiful song of praise singing to the lord
1061.52,1063.26, resolved to resist
1063.59,1074.69, resolved to speak no more to keep his mouth shut the humiliation the resistance of the neighbors being a laughing stock all of that is just too much for him
1074.72,1076.76, impossible to go on
1077.9,1080.63, then what's look at first in one more time
1080.84,1094.97, if i say i will not mention god or speak any more in his name then within me there is something like a burning fire shut up in my bones i am weary with holding it in
1095.09,1100.97, and i can not jeromio absolutely explode
1101.03,1104.57, he continued to keep his mouth shut
1105.14,1108.29, impossibility of not
1108.47,1109.82, speaking out
1110.12,1112.01, comes even greater
1112.34,1116.42, the impossibility of speaking and obeying
1117.32,1131.93, i believe that you and i are called to day very much the same way perhaps you are not called to be a prophet like jeremias perhaps you are not called to preach
1132.11,1148.61, your profession in life as some of us believe we have been called but you are called by god there is a plan for your life in the mind of the almighty god and we who are called
1148.94,1150.38, individuals
1150.65,1152.15, congregations
1152.39,1153.53, churches
1154.07,1155.45, perhaps even
1156.14,1158.06, society as a whole
1158.48,1160.91, we who are called
1161.51,1162.65, flee
1162.89,1164.33, and we resist
1164.36,1166.19, and we are free to do that
1166.25,1167.99, again and again
1168.17,1171.14, even after we have committed ourselves to god
1171.14,1173.48, we can use our work
1173.6,1176.33, we're too busy we don't have time
1176.33,1183.17, we can use our family commitments we can use other activities
1183.92,1186.62, can even use our involvement
1186.62,1188.48, things at church
1188.66,1191.36, a way of resisting god's call
1193.1,1194.69, about it for a moment
1195.14,1197.51, rather spend our
1197.63,1201.92, one in fervent prayer and meditation
1201.95,1204.62, god forgiveness for your sin
1205.04,1211.37, you rather spend an hour with your friends in the church basement helping get ready for a fellowship dinner
1212.3,1219.2, can even use the church as a way of fleeing god and were free to do it
1219.74,1231.98, always have the choice god does give us control over our lives but sometimes for some of us i came
1232.19,1239.6, so jonah or paul or jeremiah we are so cursed or so tortured
1240.08,1241.61, o blessed
1242.09,1244.49, contends on your point of view
1244.94,1248.12, the choices and alternatives
1248.57,1252.23, become so unattractive so unrealistic
1252.35,1254.45, they become impossible
1255.02,1258.53, and we feel that we really have no choice after all
1258.89,1260.45, we finally obey
1260.78,1262.19, we speak out
1262.34,1265.58, we do what god is trying to get us to do
1266.57,1268.01, jeremiah
1268.13,1270.74, try to keep it in and we cannot
1270.8,1277.76, we feel the pain and the pressure of that fire like boiling in a closed container
1278.12,1282.11, god calls every one of us
1283.16,1285.92, we sometimes resist
1287.54,1289.58, hope you feel
1290.3,1291.92, kind of fire
1292.13,1294.05, shut up in your bones
1294.26,1296.18, you cannot keep in
1298.25,1299.66, then speak out
1300.14,1301.28, answer
1301.73,1304.04, respond to god's call
1304.58,1532.07, i melodrame to the working men meteorological manageableness
1538.25,1547.79, only come to the table we like to think of something that we call it the tips nettle promise
1547.79,1559.13, this is a special meaning not just with the table being the center of our worship service but it really is a center of our disciples met ministry
1559.25,1572.27, has something to do with his people realizing that we have a hunger a need that we can't have met by anything that we can do in our lives whether it's by reading or studying or talking
1572.3,1574.55, whatever it has to be met
1575.21,1579.5, coming to the one that can fulfill our need
1579.68,1591.44, we come to the table where we take of this bread and this cup in remembrance of jesus who gave his body and his blood on our behalf
1591.86,1599.69, but we also come to the table together you see we could take this alone but we come to this table
1599.75,1602.27, together all of you out there listening
1603.5,1608.75, a time when we come as christ wanted us to come as a people
1609.2,1613.43, believers were in passing the bread to each other
1613.55,1619.85, in seeing each other at that table where we sit in humility and seeing each other
1619.85,1621.44, all of god
1621.98,1625.76, see them reflected through the eyes of our host jesus christ
1626.93,1628.22, a head
1628.52,1637.28, we go away from the table each time more able to understand god's promise for the world that god gave to us
1637.58,1640.07, and so we ask you to come to day
1640.13,1644.84, wherever you are whatever situation that you may be in
1645.05,1651.02, we also ask you and this is a stretch for it all difficult
1651.32,1655.19, try to think of some of the other people that are here
1655.88,1658.43, think of some of the other circumstances
1658.61,1660.2, the same table
1661.4,1663.5, to see them reflected in
1663.5,1666.26, a host jesus christ
1666.68,1667.76, price
1670.22,1674.57, gracious god we thank you so much for this gift that you give us here
1675.2,1677.33, feeling this in this way
1677.33,1681.23, that jesus christ gave us this way of remembering
1682.16,1683.6, remembering
1683.96,1688.49, love for us and how we are to share that to pass it along with one another
1688.88,1692.24, we have set you bless each person listening now
1693.38,1696.62, but their table it extends from this one
1696.77,1703.4, as the bread the cup that they have before them even if it's just held in their mind
1704.15,1705.83, but this
1706.28,1708.32, body as we partake
1708.32,1711.02, for so the name of jesus christ would pray
1712.58,1718.7, for it was on that last night that jesus sat with his disciples sharing the passover meal
1719.27,1724.73, and he took a loaf of bread and after he had blessed it he broke in and said this is my body
1724.73,1728.21, broken for you do this in remembrance of me
1729.59,1733.85, in the same way after they had finished eating he took the cup
1734.42,1738.32, said this cup is the new governor of my blood poured out for you
1739.88,1742.07, this i remember some
1742.25,1748.82, for as often as ye eat of the bread and drink of this cup you tell the board story
1750.68,1752.15, come again
1752.69,1779.81, to come beausire
1779.84,1802.43, i osawatomie
1802.55,1804.86, prayer for you this day
1804.95,1806.84, a prayer of blessing
1807.32,1811.46, perhaps a prayer calling down the curse of god on your head
1812.27,1816.29, depends on your own point of view i suppose
1816.44,1818.06, i wish for you
1818.09,1819.65, prayer for you
1819.86,1821.96, the prophet's choice
1822.56,1823.67, you
1823.85,1825.77, the prophet jeremiah
1826.04,1829.85, here and understand the call of god prarie
1830.9,1835.34, misery of holding that in and refusing to speak
1835.49,1836.72, yours
1837.11,1839.87, till you are weary with holding it in
1840.26,1845.96, you cannot any more until you give way to god's will
1846.14,1859.85, but it burst out one
1860.27,1872.69, he 
1873.11,1879.41, the other
