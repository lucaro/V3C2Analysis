94.38,96.24, things you write
96.42,105.42, if you're not enough with it i mean there's something wrong with your material i don't think they should base on story or topic which you're not obsess with

160.77,163.95, i really knew exactly what the next scene is
163.95,179.67, they really know what to extenuate kind of orchestra should be playing under the underlines melodies of the singers and so on so and so he was very easiest and i remember the last bar last
