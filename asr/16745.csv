0.42,19.32, on insanientis brightness and contrast even color
19.8,84.33, lovelace to the sea galantines after effect forerunning to show you the perfect anticipate is a really really important effect because he can do so many different things visit so it can be used to address basically any aspect of your of your colour nor can it for coloration to make your image lighter darker at contrast whatever so it's really the essentially fact for collocation solet apply it to our composition elwha already prepared her laetor footage we want to adjust its color using the caressant the footage so in the previous lesson you've seen that i can apply such a fact to adjusters but if we only want to affect this one layer entertaining we have here you do not need to keep it on separate tyrants put it on the layer itself now the corselet consists of this one
84.66,161.4, grapes a line and you can lick on it and modify it to address your image and the aim of sisteron is that you need or i want you to understand what his line means and how you need to change it to get what kind of effect is such that you do not just play with or without really understanding what is going on but really to understand what is happening here and the exact same effect also exists in parson i think there is more easy to understand first so therefore let's not quickly with two for the shop i've unpunctually only german version here but in your english here and you could go to macerating like that and then catastrophes and this congregate he explains you what a calling on her so what a line sense is how sir colourless various of the original image are met to values of fine result
161.46,168.99, so for example this point he also curved tells at fifty per cent gray of the import
169.02,204.3, me too or results in percent gray in the output and hundred percent white in the import becomes hundred percent white in the output on the other hand if you want to make your image now darker so you do not want to have a hundred percent white to get to become unrepentent white but it should become darker he can move a point it down and if i do a economise the image becomes darker because hundert wide and original image is in the result this gray vauher 
204.9,222.45, the same idea of course it can also move this point and say a hundred percent black should become something like this graveyard percent black is import should become this output here which makes the entire image effectively much lighter
223.17,264.81, and this is a way to make elements light or dark of course if a brighter its image oderit here you seem to also lose some quality or sororities the image in that way doesn't really look very natural and dissipate if you make black says eighty percent gray or something like this you affect a free erase every thing that is so you have no really dark poison your image any more the for a much nicer way to make it brighter is to say take me here in additional point by clicking and here also on the lateral point
264.99,267.0, maybe like this
269.16,313.38, and so this no says something like i still want to allow very dark short and present black still remains under percent black but if you go a little bit lighter it becomes her in the result a lot lighter another words you do not forbid undecent black completely but i just make it occur less frequently so bright your image by choosing a curve said makes her in this stockport meticulous of stockport to hear a bright colossus more less dark grey becomes her or ready fifty per cent grayish lighter
313.44,320.19, but you see that this looks really more contrast than if i simply 
321.93,329.16, moved to see i saw the image becomes also lighter but it by far not looks that good
329.16,349.29, talking about contrast to can see if i disallow he is a very white elements are so it's like white mats now to twenty five per cent gray and black to seventy five percent and totalement get brighter or less bright
349.47,394.35, because you made both the dark elements less dark and tender light elements less light so i told her i have just lost a lot of contrast but what you usually want is of course to have more contrasts than you had before and how can you do this i mean you cannot move this point here in the opposite direction or moved below because undecent black cannot get more than hundred percent black and an percent white cannot become more than hundred percent white so what is there for cantooned percent white must stay hundred percent white but in but the other light areas of the picture is one should become even lighter
394.35,401.34, so makes a light portions even lighter and the dark regions of the messias should get
401.49,414.69, easier such a kind of escort it says makes a bright regions brighter and makes a dark region darker and this into results in more contrast
415.29,417.39, he can make us less
417.45,454.35, sure or more subtile now we have more contrasts than before if you stop to skepsey you want to make the dark elements lighter answer light elements darker console loose contrast her sole image looks much less contrast so normal as corpore contrast this is cohesive ted as curveless contrast ka i hope this give you a brief idea of all you can modify it contrast and in general how how light your images
454.74,471.39, and the next thing i want to show you said you can do this also for individual colonels a fortinate switchback to after effects so again he is a curve has exactly the same meaning now so i can see now i make
471.45,495.81, the very dark elements much brighter and everything very bright he becomes for the basic the under percent white her so i brightened my image quite lot and if i inspector some kind of scarf example also such such an escort will increase my contrast and as sorry discoverers and is
495.99,533.43, shaped like this is as cowerin rease my contrast and now i do not want to do this for she entire image so i cliches points i move some way to get rid of some but i now want to influence individual callahan this can be done by choosing her intense of art the red green or blue channel depend as i can for example say i want to have more green and my image so what i do i maxence more light perairie up my image by making
533.55,548.25, everything more green no can see really every thing becomes more green you want to say a listens the bright regions should get rena and cease areas not now make sure that
548.79,552.42, this lower part looks more or less like a straight line
552.42,570.21, i can see a doctor can see have not much influence of the green but a light regions and here are much influenced by the green no no i can compensate can say for example of kalesar we want the dark regions to become blue
570.21,573.33, so we take the blue channel
573.33,579.87, and make it more in the dock regions and in the light regions it should
580.17,633.48, not be have so much influence there we brightened up so we made so blue more of visible in the dark regions now you see that dark area her become bluish and these areas are still tinted more green can even reduce the armor and now you subtract if effectively blue from the lighter regions which makes the lighter egano become yellow so of course this does not yet look like a really artistic image but i hope it gave you some idea or i hope you are able now to interpret this cure her and understand what it means and began if i just want to change the brightness of your midst the orgy before course i can do the sistant say no i wanted the entire material or not as bright
633.81,658.71, and and thought of the different courses to relieve modify the colour and so look of your image okay that said for this school lesson i hope you enjoy it and you are my name is maior mamma would not come i hope you join again for the next pool
