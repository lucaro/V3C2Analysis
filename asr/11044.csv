55.41,61.71, what are looks when we see the opportunities dunchurch service typically when you can stop a start recording
62.04,65.61, one of the points is of the first set him
65.94,73.86, seated you have him and typically that's about six eenterest time to stop and start with calling and rest you told me limit
74.34,82.11, after him and he had a good for seconds when people are sitting down in the minister's centinel sorted for the next bit a perfect chance to stop him stop
82.26,89.97, another point is just before the actual pronouncement starts again you have a good bed time when the ministers think you it was happening next
90.45,99.36, and again are the points when we stop and start a typically around when the hymns happened the basic to recording a wedding with a tiara is to court all of your audiotape

179.04,184.32, and dapamort that the time it takes to start as one not in seven seconds
185.22,223.98, the question we ask is how many people fill with us people look out work and think we're filmier maybe more people often it's just myself in julie occasionally for the larger weddings we take along a third either caviare the way we actually do all this is because of the walkers is because of these allows us to function like a large unit effectively saves one person though efficient communication foamiest one person be designated the director and as their jocosa what shots they want what they don't want and he seeth watakushi can do that and often they will direct that even being there for example julius in the details in the in the section room

298.32,309.06, another reason he switched the ras was because people just a lot more comfortable around them everybody's got a thersites days so in people see so when sorte des lily fill more home
309.15,314.73, what we used to give them to canvas people turn their backs and go quiet and we used to get for tottie couldn't use or wasn't
