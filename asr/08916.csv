0.03,11.82, okay so this is me standing on a mountain in california a couple of years ago and basically what i just want to show here is i've been doing this for a long time spending time in the wilderness outdoors
11.91,22.92, all this is what's important to me and this is what led me to do sustainable design i want other people to have experiences like this and have that opportunity so we have to make good decisions about what we do
23.37,36.45, i also spent a lot of time working in restaurants making pizza and working with plants there two different jobs to different worlds but it really taught me a lot about the kind of food i want to eat the kind of food i think other people should be able to eat
36.57,43.2, also how we grow plants fertilizers all these different things that we put into it you know how good is that really for the plan and for us
43.65,59.88, so this is how that i make an end this is what i think food should be its brain it's colorful and its healthy and i know what these ingredients are it's not coming out of the box and i don't know how to pronounce any of these things i mean this is real good food and i think we should all have access to this kind of food
61.98,70.2, now i met george tag i'm finishing up my industrial design degree and i'm working on my thesis and so i wanted to take all those things are important to me
70.41,77.94, focus him in my project so how can we do agriculture better how can we grow food in urban environments how can we look at
78.06,83.31, ability issues with in a small way but also talk about the larger issues that are affecting us
83.7,99.57, miles is something i'm sure a lot of you've heard about and talked about it's really important it's addressing this issue of local food but that's only one small part of the problem with industrial agriculture there's also a lot of waste of resources and industrial agriculture and
99.63,104.61, fertilizers pesides aricie things that we don't necessarily need to eat good food
104.94,114.42, another issue were facing is the population is quickly growing you know were reaching we're going to be reaching it to billion people in the next years
114.45,119.58, means we're running out of land to grow food others less space for us to all have
119.67,122.85, to that we need so how do we address concise
123.06,129.06, most of these people in the next year a large population are going to be living in urban centers
129.15,134.28, urban areas are great but there's not a lot of room for growing food how do we maximize
134.46,144.03, space so that we can grow food that local and healthy and good for us and i think the way to do that is to go vertical to start going food vertically
144.24,159.72, there's a lot of great concepts out there right now sort of on this large architectural scale for growing food in whitehall farm scrapers so i want to take a lot of those same principles for going through in that way and bring it down to a smaller
159.72,165.0, home scale so we can be growing food and schools or hospitals or in your own home
165.27,171.06, so to do that i started looking at well what's already out there what kind of products are used for growing food at home
171.12,179.91, you know all of these have benefits some of them are kind of large for if you're living in a small apartment in new york or sarcis it's going to be hard to fit this in your home
180.06,186.21, or you know growing plants and so amazing in magical were you going to hide all the magic behind a white plastic box
186.87,203.58, i'm so interested in engaging the user and growing food so how can we can create something that gets people engaged in the process of taking care of plants and then getting them to think about the food that they in the choice they make and thither to the 
203.64,206.16, affect their health or the environment
206.67,225.81, i also believe in art i think art is really important and i think that its impact ful in it you know if it's beautiful it can really stick with you and it creates a memory for you that you take with you and affects the decisions that you make down the road and along the way so i want what i'm designing to also have that really beautiful esthetic value
226.65,235.5, now i know i'm going to you know i'm going to work on a vertical farm i want to figure out how i'm going to do that so there's all the ferment was to grow food but i went with hydroponic because it's
235.5,238.92, most efficient way to grow food indoors it's
239.28,246.54, more efficient in terms of water use than soil it's a lot easier to keep nutrients in the water than it is with soil
246.63,255.12, so the next thing i wanted to do as i needed to go out and get some plans i needed to start growing food and figuring some of these things out so i went out and
255.21,266.79, farmer des which he actually spoke here a few months ago and they have tons of great stuff there lots of great plans lots of good people working there with tons of good advice i really recommend going and checking it out
266.85,286.95, this is my first working prototype this design is actually based on a project on by some people up in brooklyn called window farms and basically i built this system because i wanted to learn how hydroponic systems work i've never built one before i don't know what components need how does everything together launay
287.16,295.26, hydroponics is basically instead of using soil you use some other sort of substrate that the plants are growing and so these are
295.35,299.85, baked clay pellets that retain moisture for the roots to grow in
299.88,307.38, so the group can just sort of grow in and out of these pellets here and then you don't have to
307.47,308.82, so
308.94,315.57, so even though the systems working really well for me i'm thinking you know maybe there's some other things that i can do to improve on this system
315.63,322.44, you know i'm analagous sustain ability wise everything growing in plastic how can we move beyond plastic and have other materials
322.47,328.05, a lot of components here and it took a lot of time to put together so honwe make it easier for people
328.29,348.87, during my research i figured i came across people using felt to grow all kinds of different plants and for indorse and outdoor use but nobody was really using fell for hydroponic so i decided maybe that can replace the plastic in the system so i started building prototypes and testing how the water flowed through the system
349.35,372.87, and actually works really great the water comes down through the fell it gets to the roots in using the same play palates ead of having them in a little plastic basket they're just straight into the feltman then the water just runs through the fellow goes back down into the system and get cycled back in so this is some of the stuff i harboured from my farm
374.79,386.04, my studio yes so it tastes grey it's really good i encourage you to go out and grow food whatever way works best for you and this is why logoi you want to learn more please check it out and
386.37,396.0, he grunted
