0.0,22.41, hallo and welcome to the rustle brown show in this episode in going to be talking about editing video inside of adobe photo shops and in this case it some video from a decayed mavick pro taken here at the california coast now it looks pretty good but
22.53,25.71, you were to color correct this using
25.98,33.09, i came raptures here inside of a doe potash it would then look like this
33.15,36.84, we minute do that again before
36.96,45.48, then after what i'm going to show you how to make these corrections here inside a potshot what's get started
45.57,76.65, right over here is my original four came video captured with my dogmatic i've placed it here inside of photo shop and you can see the single layer of video here of course you can do color correction in premier and after effects but if you think like a potshot use you may want to try color correcting your video here inside of potash and of course you can then export the high resolution files and place those into premier or after effects
76.77,78.12, let's get started
78.15,97.41, it starts of course with converting this video layer into a smart object that's critical right clicking here on the layer itself i can select to convert to smart object right there then go to the filtered and down here to camera raw filter
97.53,102.27, you're familiar with the camera of features that you normally used with a still image
102.33,106.44, same thing applies here to this moving image
106.44,108.87, in this case i'm in a start
108.93,119.04, the classic way of correcting the color balance to the image and get rid of the colored cast riever here in selecting tone curve
119.49,137.37, then i'm going to sea and target each individual channel it's a classic way of adjusting the color balance and getting rid of a color cast and especially in this case when there's no direct sun and its cloudy i can really improve the overall
137.4,146.19, quality of this image here are the basic simply dragged the shadow slide over to the edge of the mountain range
147.72,155.07, we translate what r brown just said he meant to say to select the black point and
155.1,161.7, move over to the right and tell it touches the first pickels
161.79,178.2, are visible here on the historian ah now you know this is a classic technique that i learned many many years ago from the creator of potash of course thomas more then go to the green channel
178.26,184.44, do the same thing moved over to the edge of the mountain range here just like this
184.62,190.05, i looking at the screen yet not really i'm just moving the default
190.05,194.85, setting across all of these moving it to the edge of the mountain range
195.12,199.62, then i'm going to go back through them again and visually adjust them
199.62,206.97, in this case i want a little bit warmer shadows here sliding here to the left and
207.18,212.55, a little bit more neutral color to the waves and the high lights
212.85,216.3, here on the right go through each one of these
216.39,264.27, yet again and readjust them a little bit warmer here with the green as you can see you can put a green cast to your image by moving too far to the left and the little bit warmer as i moved to the right and the same is true for the highlights here on the right i'm simply sliding this over and adjusting it like this let's finish off with the blue values here once again don't be afraid to move it away to the right and to the left and till you find the exact position for it getting of that colour castoria and you really going to be surprised how much colour cast there might be in the shots that you may not have seen before and of course do i have a color calibrated monitor yes i do so it helps me in adjusting these
264.75,265.92, great
265.95,268.74, a great start to this whole process
268.74,275.58, then i'm going to quickly hear go over to the basic settings and go right into my exposure
275.82,277.5, highlights
277.5,282.06, this case holding down the option or old geof course
282.09,286.47, to see the areas that are burning out so i don't
286.8,292.83, my highlights and my shadows it looks like i could drop that down a bit
293.07,295.08, and strolling down
295.47,309.93, always add a little bit of clarity look the way it brings out the high lights in the cliff right here in the centre of the image and of course vibrant not too much but just a little bit to bring up the colours within the image
310.17,320.22, looking really great down here this icon right here was show me before and after tapping at once is before
320.52,324.0, and then after so our corrections are looking really great
324.3,334.26, wait there's more over here under the effects cabalas and a little bit of behave loowit takes those mid tones and
334.41,336.96, more clear as you slide that
337.35,339.6, looking pretty good but
339.9,344.58, take it to the next level and make your brains explode
344.7,367.08, i'm going to use this tool right here the adjustment brush given the fact that the camera is not moving and just hovering in the sky i have the ability to paint over my image and highlight areas with this brush the first thing i'm going to do is clean up the colour of this grass that's right
367.11,380.85, may find this to be criminal but i'm going to adjust the color of the grass because of the drought in california it's a little bit too brown and i want it to be a really nice green grass
380.94,382.92, notice over here to the right
383.07,386.01, i selected a color here
386.01,390.27, this colored picker right here for the green i want to work with
390.36,393.78, and then i can start to paint in
393.81,408.27, grass i have my density sat here that looks pretty good feathering the edge and the flow is set here looks great i think i'm going to bring up a density a bit more like this let's watch what happens
408.75,436.65, as i paint over here to the right notice on changing the color of the grass as you sing yourself he's a criminal i am a criminal but am i altering the grass in any way in terms of adjusting the pickels no and merely recovering the grass i'm trying to justify the fact that i'm going in here and
436.74,439.53, doing this criminal thing
439.71,443.52, this grass all much better that looks
443.79,468.75, i paint the sin and i'm going over a couple of times because i can then add more and more density for this grass just like that doesn't that look so much better that grass really looks nice okay this looks pretty good we made some adjustments to our basic settings we need some adjustments to our tone curve
469.59,485.97, gone in and adjusted behave all of the same types of things you would do to an image are now applied here to this video let's click okay there you have it you have just seen away to
485.97,498.51, color correct video in this case from a decameron side of adobe potshots it may see illegal but it's really cool give it a try
