879.33,907.77, this is going to be one of those what we all quote controversial races on the ballot what kind of feed back or you get it we've gotten very positive feedback like i say we're talking primarily the business owners and business owners they can see what the impact of additional visitors and antelope of bent land of commercial property it will have a tremendous economic impact in any business one can see that
907.8,934.41, now you have the endorsement of the lagoon chamber of commerce i believe had i that well that came doradoes but they serve their membership and they are representing the business community and when they serve by their membership and sausage overwhelming response in favour of the racing issue they felt that they had to make that public and reflect that that's how the community felt
934.62,962.43, to the panopolitan hadn't vote in this well it will sit out there and continue the increasing in value which means the value keeps going down on a property tax rolls and that affects all of us the bank may or may not be able to find a barford it's hard to make a track that size operate is just a trinity if you don't have the party drink a man
962.46,977.28, and that's one side of the issue that's the go when we come back from the breatheth ootside of the issue and we'll talk to the contents of this issue when we return that after this word from some of the folks that make our show possible

1076.79,1088.97, you could probably get just what you're looking for right here at home is not duchesnois more than time
1089.51,1091.34, and the
1100.37,1155.12, to our show that discussing the issue of pauwating on harassing inaction again you can call in your questions to my guess five six four eight three eight six is the number we just heard from sanderson who is the spoke person for the pinewoods economic development association ornamented middlebrook seastoke person for citizens who care to that detected the northernmost
1155.12,1159.47, gamelin legal so were concerned that we get all the answers that question
1161.12,1177.59, we are living in a time of some economic time and there's no big mistake about that sending that watering at the track of any wood down could bring in possibly four hundred jobs
1177.65,1201.56, what's wrong with that while i practise at all i've said this publicly in was economic development and all of us are free economic development and their concern and their money for that is pure in appreciate them and none of us are trying to not jobs but i think that is every time gambling's been put on the issue for voting on the issues been taken away from that even the proponents of in the industry sated
1201.59,1219.26, you can never get gambling past you have to make the issue gasthaus banter race track under down as example i personally talked several times to them and to their done of their spokes persons down there they tell me they have about to full time job
1219.38,1235.4, the jobs on part time bases at the track mostly on week ends and about seasonally half the year even though very jobs isarte job is not something to say no to we need those kind of jobs but the other side of the issue that we need to look at
1236.09,1309.23, some of the well first of all in order for pinewoods down to be an effective and economy it has to be a bible program we've got to be able to first someone has to come in here and get a lisette texas racing commission regulates it sentimento do that somebody's going to have to come up with an investment for five six million dollars to bring that track just up to they don't understand that track doesn't have the kind of barnes it needs it the track surfeiting
1309.47,1371.48, as the permeating gegenstand nobody bids poniards now then is the issue but i think the issue would be met in that case except that i believe there will be somebody that comes along and tries to put it on and think they'd be this much polish farithee were not on paper in the way we caught it was a vile action and the problem nor is been in many cases when a track comes in it's very close very marginal other tracts and texas are not really making money they turned to several things first of all they turned a taximeter it free taxes for five years or ten years the second thing that really i think artapates ought to think about is how many tracks have been supported bonaparte used all have class one tracks approved and all those facilities were menegitis based upon some public funds being put in there we need to expect in this as she passes that will be thinner isipione to help support the track
1371.48,1421.85, but one of the things i was going to ask sanine ran out of time that's one of the things to get used to doing a third of a show once a week is opposed the radio show two hours every day i was going to ask her i know that her group has said he that this would also be a boost to the quichuas to horsemen and ranchers and that sort of thing would that not be truehearted i talk to giantesses the train and pinewoods out here now he's recently moving his horses and he said that you know the horses need to be close to those racetracks arkansas dalesfolk so from that standpoint i don't think it will be that big a boon to a local
1422.24,1426.65, i let go into 
1426.89,1491.42, other issues with regard to waiting senatorial about the economical boot to the county i've noticed in a lot of your advertising in your literature you talk about the molestations
1491.42,1515.42, the cab it will bring but the detrimental facts it i'll have on our county and i be glad to discuss some of those another thing that i wanted to ask you i i ran out of time and that was a anybody was talked to any ebullient people is law enforcement supporting this i'm looking off cameraman encouragement
1516.14,1517.58, yeah
1519.2,1603.86, orthoptera can you could hear that was that they're going primarily from other areas for there is wagering it tracks now any of the law enforcement people in this area support your position nor they do a number of law enforcement people some of them because the political climate and races going on it said to us we can't come out publicly and nasiban that there's going to be a problem there not liberty to say who those people are if you go back and look at the director of the f the director of the septuagenarian as legalized eligibles on come in to play one of the problems of attests we've been using an manhattanites a while that crime to work through the system once people begin to get in the habit of crime a lot of the crime is quite alarming crime to support a gambling habit and where you were just really begun racing and texas then the problem is going to continue on and we both prepare me to gambling and adonis not like voting for a district you don't like me gottee
1604.1,1701.39, syme talked about the job she said i could bring in a forbore as possibly jowter amount of jobs there are the group is proposing something that to some degree of the other wood besancon of the area is the alternate ways of boosting are economic position inattention
1701.39,1706.85, that's barometer trying to take their students and i we've got a lot of impact
1706.94,1800.18, and i from parents of university students originality when you havin fun don't the public for on this on the compass when again gets mondaine october twenty six this coming monday night at seven o'clock in the grand ball room again i would like to think sending frigidus we want the show to be a community for him where we can present all sides of the issues and give you an opportunity to cast wives and make wise needn't plan to effect nackington we one of the morning raconteur
