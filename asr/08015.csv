0.03,4.08, meanderin gave us a slap of a clap
5.49,13.05, thank you bastard with this thing is your name in what class of sea and we of new
13.35,18.3, i'm talking to you yes i am linda holland i graduated from
18.51,21.0, academy in 
21.09,24.3, in new york city and i'm going to talk to or
24.75,36.57, for answer okay so just a little bit about you back in your family reclining and when they were there if he moved were from and how it yoshiwara
37.53,39.63, my parents were
39.75,44.13, in japan they were through missionaries so i was born in kilt
44.28,47.76, then we lived in a change
47.85,51.81, my parents made them rather usual decision to send us
51.87,56.52, japanese public schools so i went to japanese public school through a grade
56.94,58.08, then
59.22,62.22, the grade was an american school
62.61,64.17, then
64.65,68.01, we in two years and a
70.29,71.19, you know
72.51,76.56, so i was a kind of a strange person i see 
76.71,79.83, i mean if you go through japanese school
79.98,83.88, i forms in provincial japan through a grade
84.36,88.77, it really makes you quite japanese despite my looks
88.83,90.96, quite american
90.99,96.57, i was told that my teacher when the sixth grade i know which is really impolitic
96.81,99.3, in japan to be told that you keep your
99.93,101.52, and
101.79,107.37, so you know canada was so then so i guess that was there
107.49,109.23, the 
112.86,114.15, i think
114.27,117.36, think it was sort of my first sort of
118.14,123.12, well you know i was thinking back you know because i got your question are
123.33,130.11, and i think said it's an odd thing to say but she was the place where i found out i was smart
130.89,135.81, in third grade japanese school like it the best grade on a contest
135.81,140.97, and the teacher brought me up to the sun the class and basically said the guide can do it why can't you
141.03,146.52, at the end of my i mean you don't get to both drop in a comic bomb and beat them at their own contest
146.52,148.38, like not far
148.56,154.38, that was the end of good grades from eating japanese school and then i got to see a and i looked around and there like
156.0,158.22, here i can do compete with
158.58,160.17, and
160.5,164.28, like i shot out a bottle and so my most
164.34,167.04, all experience sitting in
174.66,176.31, doctor
179.04,180.09, and
180.42,182.4, it was senior english
182.76,183.78, and
183.87,187.95, here shortly reading majorem this part there will
188.55,196.83, and he said in the book another posits that anything that violates a perfect moment is a moral
197.43,198.45, i said
198.78,201.03, the passage of time and moral than
201.78,203.82, that was laden
204.03,211.14, teacher writing a recommendation to yale which accepted me saying if she had a last name i would think she was descended from socrates
211.17,214.35, i
215.85,238.5, so sees this great sitooation the car with did he just had me on the shoulder i sorry i thought i'm not got a single or a signal for getting over assurance isotopes was the professor he was
240.48,241.8, in
241.98,243.63, and brilliant
243.78,245.67, he had the presence of mind
245.97,247.11, to
247.17,249.72, as a young girl
250.11,255.03, really wasn't clear about her position in the world
255.39,259.02, come out of that much japanese school and mister background and
261.27,265.92, and at that time i think it was still very including me with her i was that well
266.13,269.58, i didn't feel it american or japanese now i know that i'm both
270.06,275.73, so it gives me very solid ground stand on but i didn't have that and carved that out for myself 
277.41,279.39, a man grateful to doctor chris
280.26,293.88, i feel like recovered a bunch of questions allowances oh i wanted to hear a little bit more about your experience and japanese the transition in the carissima be like
293.91,305.58, that the shock or like the experience may be within that transition moment like that year or something yet this is differences and how how you feel about it that it was a hard for you did you enjoy it
305.64,312.36, well i would say that the defining event of my childhood to place in japanese school
314.46,318.12, was ever thief forth grade i'm not quite sure
318.57,321.12, and the teacher
321.3,324.12, ode on the blackboard the words
324.48,327.06, atomic bomb and defeat
327.69,328.92, and
329.37,333.96, quite sure there is a way to teach canalboat the atomic bombs
334.23,337.11, but all the kids turned round listomere
337.56,339.66, the kid turned around and looked at me
340.14,341.64, and
341.7,344.01, what you doing tiresome 
344.16,346.98, i thought it was really my fault you know
347.52,353.91, and so that in a sense that moment was sort of the end of my
355.44,359.19, i didn't i was old enough to know like complicity
362.07,363.9, forever put me
364.56,365.61, i
366.39,371.4, it was i didn't really want to make me run to the american side either because who would do such a thing
373.77,375.84, i mean i still think
375.87,382.65, now who would do such a thing but when you think about it i mean i guess my parents 
382.71,384.48, to them to
384.69,386.01, we're not guess
387.0,389.58, it probably didn't occur to them i mean
389.67,394.14, really one of the fundamental conditions of my childhood is
394.38,402.36, which is that my parents felt the need to go over and convert them into it better religion
403.47,406.35, schools and the children were good enough for me to be great with
406.59,410.49, you know i love my parents and i respect them a lot but i think
410.88,414.63, coming from an american mind set where the
414.66,418.5, the fundamental base line raises his
419.22,420.54, better
420.69,423.36, and americans are even best
423.99,429.12, so i grew up in the middle of that sort of swirling mass of contradictions
429.39,433.44, second there this time christ or didn't hear shewell
433.71,435.42, and with you she
435.72,440.55, and so my most recent from i've made no three films dealing with world war i
440.88,444.57, a post war us japan relations because
444.87,448.56, in gap between what i learned from
448.86,450.12, people
450.45,452.22, just a japanese school but
452.46,454.71, the experience of the war in the defeat
454.92,458.37, the american narrative a victory is
459.09,463.26, it seemed insurmountable so the three films that i may win of defeat
463.53,466.74, and now things left behind about how she
467.04,468.99, for my attempt to
472.32,474.6, he can't reach the gap but
474.6,479.13, maybe fill it so now that i've done with my world war two tregonning
479.49,480.36, you know
482.19,508.68, nature was sagrestano altalaat the first year at seeing this is one destitution into that having gone up in the japanese consisted in either the same thing is wondering how what your experience is like may be you remember the first day i cigarette first while you were you know don't have a lot of memories for my child 
510.12,511.11, but
511.11,513.06, i must have religion
513.21,521.28, because that's one thing you get at least when i went to japanese public school i had to work like a dog and just even damastes king
521.67,526.02, there you are very very accustomed to studying very hard
528.72,529.68, and
530.82,534.03, i must have i mean yale really taught me how to
534.57,535.71, right
536.04,539.37, myself from my own ideas but i'm sure that
539.88,545.4, this class i just mentioned had a lot to do with helping me with that as well
547.29,548.67, i remember
549.18,551.76, in the old days the school was up on the hill
553.92,555.78, it was my sister and i
556.53,561.9, an a little operation out of a suitcase where the door food was like
562.92,564.9, it was cafeteria for
565.14,571.41, we buy dominant sybrandt sacks like that to them it 
571.41,575.07, and a modest missionary life profit
575.31,579.09, we would go shopping and so i guess that was our
579.6,584.58, a sort of way of staying japanese because it was a little kitchen at the door were
584.85,586.71, little bit so
587.31,602.34, operation going insectile another any other events experiences you member from your your two years i see that that you member funereal my ponies
602.94,607.29, i let you have a really great story to tell i don't know missus men
607.35,608.7, japanese
608.97,612.36, for many many many many years that penitence
613.08,616.17, and she i remember
616.29,619.14, she she also ran the cook
619.38,624.09, it was cooking through semi professional she had been
624.24,626.49, she had been a man she would have
626.55,629.16, to become a complete actor passion was
629.64,630.87, i
631.02,634.05, and it would really really cool productions
634.26,645.3, i remember for some reason i remember calling lodging degenerating into i just have a memory of that during a couple of peppermint but you know
645.39,650.22, when i made a bow which is the film that that
651.3,660.27, resistance to us military basis in japan to a treasure trove of art that i excavated from you seem valtrauta
661.59,664.8, and for its premier to be at the
665.13,675.06, the great ashore and tournier sit on june fifteenth at two thousand ten which was a fifty adversary of the death of the marcomani
675.66,676.65, and
676.83,678.45, i had heard about it
678.6,682.5, on the i don't know how she heard about it but she heard about it on news
683.13,689.85, and she's in a wheelchair now she's gone she and her husband came up from corbet to hester a
690.09,694.47, my sister janet was there and jammed her too and she said
694.62,699.93, never talked about it at sea but i marched in the demonstrations as a christian
700.77,702.0, and
704.64,706.47, pretty special and
710.64,714.72, sunnysides seventy
715.08,717.0, in the late
717.06,743.85, an how about now looking back at her experience in december more poetic because of the purpose of this maclaire what do you you know what do you now reflecting take away from those years i give have memories of relationship or what is it like the relearning or linton about yourself or anything that you know looking back at your time of seething about
744.99,746.7, you know
747.42,748.74, i
750.18,758.94, i think it was an even there was definitely like i was definitely not part of the main stream cool kiss
759.69,761.25, but
761.94,764.19, think already then realized
764.64,766.71, that's not what i wanted to have life
766.92,768.57, i hang out with
769.56,773.31, close female friends belong out with like these
777.42,779.19, and
779.34,781.14, think it was sort of the
781.83,784.8, i of my exploration of
786.21,791.01, as i said before a sort of american and my japanese what is my i mean
791.22,793.53, american passport but
794.55,795.48, i don't
795.51,797.46, a big because i don't
797.7,799.89, even nation states really
800.61,804.21, and i believe that that kind of nationalism
804.27,805.5, to
805.98,810.72, and i think that he was sort of a really nice
813.09,815.73, incubator from me to
816.33,820.71, to think about to be in defined my way in the world
821.16,822.24, japanese
823.26,849.57, one is a fine chap for a place this is a graduate school like that the future the score to like the fetters on now this formative the seventh person to have very different stories in a darrin but all kind of nose in the smaller a bigger way has kind o i see how a kind of shape the presenting you know if you have had any
850.14,856.29, hope for like the school as in this in japan raising the foreign community
856.83,859.83, you know i would just i cannot untie
859.98,863.13, a bilingual trilingual education is
863.28,868.23, you read in the new york times that is proven now scientifically that
869.37,872.37, the lines that are active every day
872.37,874.77, of
874.89,877.08, the onset
877.2,883.5, minds that are actually used every day delay the onset of a timer by ten years
884.01,888.87, because if you have a blind it means that you have to have a menominee that's controlling
889.08,890.25, as
890.55,892.14, makes you smarter
892.65,893.7, and
894.0,896.19, i think i also makes you
897.24,900.21, more inclined to
900.27,901.83, able to accommodate
903.39,904.62, understanding
904.86,908.43, few filter experience through two languages
908.58,909.57, the same time
911.7,912.9, i would say
913.89,917.64, try to teach as many languages and learn as many languages as possible
918.33,935.43, and this caacupe of other things an we was sort of activities were you like it was coming and activity he offered all a woman therefore the war artistic norwood of delegating activities desiccate
937.17,959.19, and norris and i mentioned the one english teacher that he even members tante members of that community that you the left impact on immediate or just a teacher or the people who worked as therefore
959.31,963.87, and i really bondage he was also missionary daughter
964.38,965.79, and
966.84,971.79, she had been japanese i think to the first or second grade and we really bonded
972.0,974.58, and other than my younger sister janet
974.76,978.15, genus the person that i've stayed close to
978.45,980.01, speak regularly
980.61,983.55, we both lost our mom's early
983.94,986.52, a lot of the missionary came
986.91,988.53, it was the man
989.76,992.85, the cancerous in the early sixties
992.97,996.12, a complicated i think
996.42,998.64, a lot to do with
998.79,999.84, american
999.84,1000.74, women
1000.92,1002.36, trying to
1002.57,1004.1, themselves
1004.1,1008.45, in the female public space that was allowed in japan i don't think it was an accident
1010.85,1014.51, i think the missionary community
1014.51,1031.64, in obedient experience from some of the other like a heart may be experience what was your experience like going up as a missionary kid on amongst the danes thing in the sea thing and i guess us like a bigger one part of your upbringing
1033.23,1034.79, well
1035.78,1042.38, my parents were always in rural i mean provincial japan so my knowledge of corbett was only
1042.56,1052.1, i mean i can't really say that i know bicause i mean one thing actually that alexander marooned to take the train
1052.49,1056.87, to go to the only temple remarks
1057.29,1058.7, i told
1058.85,1060.08, or
1060.74,1065.0, i was on hand the month and then there was another one and they were the great
1065.03,1066.83, and that's where
1067.46,1068.51, i started
1069.68,1076.13, i started yet because i skipped a grade i lamed up graduating at when i was 
1076.37,1077.48, and
1078.47,1081.98, alexander and i shared some kind of artistic
1082.37,1083.96, for
1085.28,1087.14, i think i see 
1087.65,1090.92, certainly my sense of gen comes from
1091.52,1093.74, in a japanese loose and
1094.01,1095.6, like primary colors
1098.33,1115.19, the anteater my question on his wondering if we can if there's any other may be specially seething that you we have uncovered yet that you would like to share a messinese you antisthenes the unique people who
1115.55,1121.82, he awkwardly that you know was a shorter time but if you have any the memories that you
1121.82,1123.32, let
1128.6,1140.39, they graduation or leaving the new gothic to the states after graduation wallowing in a living little may will would happen was that
1140.42,1143.69, because i was so young when i like 
1143.99,1146.54, they turned me down the first time
1146.57,1148.37, i was determined to get in
1148.79,1153.44, and so i spent a year not going to college
1153.62,1158.69, printing throughout japan so i worked on a dairy farm and idle
1158.99,1160.88, the apprentice with a
1163.43,1165.86, de s we were
1165.98,1167.66, my
1168.11,1170.12, the apprentice with a weaver
1171.2,1172.01, and
1172.01,1176.6, i've heard that yale was accepting me by the time i got there i was so happy
1176.96,1179.0, i had
1179.21,1182.93, conditions because when i go to yale
1183.2,1185.72, encounter obnoxious
1185.87,1186.92, wealthy
1187.64,1189.29, it people
1189.62,1193.85, could stand my own ground because i knew that i could do something they couldn't
1196.82,1201.95, i i good thank you 
1202.04,1214.37, good god plain amunition was i did not because i am but maybe i yesterday you some of what may be your sperience and the word or a little phrase
1214.61,1217.67, what would it be to think and maybe why
1220.04,1221.15, and that
1221.9,1227.75, i thought that kind of timothy's
1227.75,1231.08, you go
