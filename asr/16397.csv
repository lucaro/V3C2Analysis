6.36,8.91, the amendment of the city's master plan
9.06,10.56, june last year
11.52,17.61, road three twenty four on the east side of federal
17.61,19.86, he was marketing that for our
19.98,21.33, we
21.51,30.57, so the way that the way that warehouse is designed proposed right now no application has been put in
31.86,40.44, and so there really trying to figure out what to do now about that about that cathro they have an obligation of the road
40.71,47.19, our master plan he required to build that state department of transportation would obviously be responsible for the
47.64,53.1, were they overpass and this is really all about you an remember about
53.16,56.55, about eight years ago there was a lot of discussion
56.7,73.11, there was a lot of discussion about getting people of the freeway and further west into federal wife and remember they were raudales outflanked they were going to wideawake all the way to dash point
73.29,83.19, i stopped and it really has to do with access and freeway access because three this be all past a huge log up point
83.46,90.27, so the men alone of discussion even that the three twenty four was one of those areas
90.42,95.97, i seen three winter were a lot of other aren't a lot of good choices
95.97,98.43, the freeway and get people at
98.76,108.42, i want five interest at the tall younger
110.13,112.77, it is because i mean it eaten
112.8,116.82, that his being there was proposed for replication process
118.38,131.07, i just want give you that visitation we also eratosthenes the fine dancing as it isn't altogether on that well i would that a very very important piece of this i needed i have got
131.22,136.35, think so i my name is michael brown i'm vice president of the stereos
136.8,141.66, organization and a couple of statements and many have a couple of questions 
141.66,150.03, in terms of the process that would have avoided this sort of acrimony that we've experienced that city council meetings
152.73,157.65, i think some extent the result of the fact that our notification that a
157.89,165.12, processing plant was going to be built in our neighborhood across the street from her neighborhood was eight villains
165.39,173.64, i had to build a six by foot since i put back in so no notification no discussion no
173.73,187.71, in a groundwork for what he can commencement means or what all the craters are so it's no wonder that i was only third seventeen days to get up to speed and get notice and make public statements that we were fated
189.24,192.06, yet four hundred people did make one
192.12,205.65, right but we were pleased that we had such a small short period of time at any rate for all were all made common were all here the second thing is 
205.98,213.36, a position i work in the health care industry is extraordinarily complex and regulated and
213.51,214.92, states are very high
215.04,218.91, similar in some ways to you do 
218.94,235.53, i imagine navigating something like this would so many competing interests is difficult i would say what i notice in the hospital is when there's etruscan use them to make something happen if you wanted to happen
235.56,247.08, you can make some stop something from happen to pass we you want this little wiggle room and the one is specific instances that a mascoutin to
247.17,259.02, i reviewed the preferred free ere the project as a process e review rather than process for revenging through all the rules in the regulations can come agreement
259.86,263.49, if the facility was
266.52,271.8, identified to be within two hundred feet of residential neighborhood
272.79,285.66, would be faced for review righteous of that now i looked through the definition paterson the maintain ninety two i think it was a federal way code and there's no definition of the word facility
286.65,291.0, for their some leeway in the definition of the term facility
291.72,295.77, you find the rule to
295.77,304.71, he to be notified by male directly it was women three hundred feet of the facility and that was interpreted as the bill
304.95,306.75, the bill
306.96,310.98, building up the party no good he built
313.08,337.5, everything that was built parking lot are whatever building similarly in the letter lindencrones to articulate i think the other day they deposit for the purpose of these boundaries considerations as to build structures including
337.62,338.79, part
338.82,344.16, you had included the parking of which is very easy to argue you could if that's what you chose
344.4,346.86, would have required a base for review
347.01,353.7, it would have required a public hearing and the owner of the burden of proof would have been an irate
355.17,362.52, band so as that is a specific decision of some one in the city made
363.09,370.44, ah extremely unfortunate and unnecessary and could easily within the realm of
370.53,375.87, protecting yourself for litigation could have been made
375.99,395.34, one point the two questions i have are one of leave had some difficulty ascertaining the courtesans of the lessor of blake at the time of the ninety four and commencement was designated as conservancy with the required two hundred foot set back
395.91,402.0, there was the stipulation it was any year the city would reconsider making it urban 
402.09,417.72, thank you was the setback in nineteen warehouse or asked for that to be done they met with neighbors and he retracted that request so that has not been the hardwater is subsequently quest to change our conservancy
417.87,425.85, some of the federal way in king county master planting maps showed us conservatism showed as for
426.3,430.86, to the north cape conservancy in the south have a turban
431.25,438.09, all the marketing material shows it simply as spintrian use
438.27,443.1, the industrial use of intent five to fifty feet of line
444.36,452.85, i got sedition in the city and i know they are overwhelmed by these requests were without
452.91,459.15, really like to know what is the current legal status what documents is that
459.57,469.11, and bastiani want toinette that apart couple of these things the first as it regards of rise now i know
469.17,474.78, first staggering about this you know come months before they actually brought their application
474.81,484.38, and it was a matter of that there were interesting about her freezer or bad it was a matter of their general interest in about that that they were looking at this
484.53,492.24, i can tell you that on the particular day of the week that he actually dropped the application i was surprised that they dropped
492.33,514.08, one of the things i have told them at all to see or work a bad or a box preferred freezer also of irony that it runner get above a couple of tents you know you never get a second chance maestrino ly by leading with his emanation of troparion
514.14,520.62, the youth opportunity to there had been all kinds of discussion going on i talked to people with
520.62,525.96, groups of out that the forest in realising of the lane
526.35,533.97, obviously a huge initiative on canoeists part of the past two years to get some bayberries
534.03,536.7, together great use for over
536.73,550.02, manner in which that was you know all of a sudden they just walked in and walk the application and then oh east what a nothing i was told young prosecutors that i was training as cameron poorly when they are surprised
550.05,559.53, this is imitated absolutely and i don't remissionem apparent absolutely ridiculous
559.65,565.56, size of the signs of regard to notification item i mean that's gone nothing to do with
565.62,572.97, with wide i just you know i start her in the first i heard about that concern ismaele start coming up and giving tone
573.12,634.14, that something that in the future we look at but there you know i would not have signed any sort of you know lorrainian you're right at that kind of thing or is it important was i know said the wrong message what he congesting by a clearly not assisted me they decided to use a certainly not happened in a much more forever so let me go there was another thing processes for the senators dietary on them in regard to their regard to their judgment in this for us i know that process three versus process poor process three is what was it would be obvious to common agreement process is changed over the course of the past twenty two years and taking a look at the concomitant of most similar aspect of that wise process three but the etheldene substantively between process three and process for its start with the sender of theirs an appeal than in those of the arians
634.32,650.61, so i just want to make sure that everybody knows that you've got the stammerer make the initial determination threshold termination and then there is a right to an appeal to the fullerian but in you know i guess the advice from 
654.27,656.82, liferent parties
658.56,660.12, we can be no
660.27,663.21, that
663.24,677.01, dorothea a huge difference between process three in process for one sacrifice one is the cost of a feeling the delirious decision
677.1,680.34, therefore sending it to the hearing of
680.85,682.77, examiner
682.86,686.31, soon i been told the burden of proof
686.49,688.95, are
689.1,695.58, review process free review if we were to appeal it the burden proved lies on us
695.61,698.04, provision was wrong
698.13,704.01, the process for review bergeron the developer and there meeting all the firemen
704.4,706.44, it's a significant difference
707.22,715.5, and it seems to me like the difference between three and four as i describe it the feet were facility means partner
715.98,720.12, and me like part of political
720.12,726.36, to make things a fastness possible for these guys or pay the dinsmores
726.63,731.4, if we can the cabinet kind of territory
732.09,754.32, he and the noise the obersteiners to speed on the property this is its property we have no vested interest in the instant look at it i derstand that that i think that's really what's feeling a lot of this seriously the small signs
