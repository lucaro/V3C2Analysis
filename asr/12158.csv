0.03,32.55, sidenote the senegal in through scripture so with the guys and astaroth some different different things for us as a church i will say i am i'm a little bit exhausted right now my family moved yesterday from one house to another in moscow and as many of you know who ever had the experience of moving that's a process and so the priest reinstate you guys that you are out here to night i should throw away and get rid of stuff because you know a
32.55,60.21, that's found in the bible somewhere so that's my first sermon but small exhausted i think i lost my mind yesterday like a little namerican don't know where it is but excited about opportunities stuff luckily what immediate to talk about and so even if i fall asleep up here i'll still be able to talk about it so
60.42,222.0, but yesterday we were moving some bunk beds and my son sam and jack as a jacket three there sharing a bombed these days and so i had some of your finest engineering students working on getting these bones out of the boys room out of the house and into the hall and so we thought we'd just go in to take a part to part and then down the stairs and we got down the stairs and discover they wouldn't fit solemnities young boy about eight years old and my little brother moved into my room and we got on beds and when you first get on your aneantissement of gustatory toothsome great chandelier day would end with a line talking about the day talking about each other's lives and ask each other questions may what house that thing going that you were talking about the other night how that relationship with that girl has a stuff how can i pray for almost always almost ended up almost always ended up in a praying for each other and sometimes we opened the door and yell geraniaceae gospel community while we were all of us were growing and christanoes that time of my life was one of the most spiritually transforming times that ever had and in one of the time they really kick started as emetrius growth in my life that i would say i got me here to ithona i because of those those knights that those times praying with my roommates and talking about life in the future where god was leading in those are my first experiences in community
222.06,224.01, true gospel community
224.76,306.51, i want us to look at some of christianities first experience in true gospel community and were going at a passage of scripture out of the book of acts that is an amazing picture of what community could be what it has been what it we sin glimpses of her even among resonant to talk about heistand of our book of our walk through the book of ashtaroth finster inventions in between as we take a break from it into a little bit with estaminet week not to remind you where we are in this and do not forget about who we are as a church and what would poisoning through the book of antecedent and conquering death and in what does that mean for us as a church a strong bilateral last week launches into our subject in our inner and our talk for the night and move us for in the next place where we're going is a church and so your
307.62,318.9, chapter two were going to read a portion of the scripture but there's something you need to know that that i believe in that we believe as a church is that we are made to be in relationship
319.53,325.71, we are made to be in relationship primarily in relationship with our god
325.95,337.92, secondarily in relationship with each other there's this time when jesus when he was hanging out on earth and teaching and he had a gay come up to him and asked him a question he said he just iterates commandment
338.34,343.26, the greatest commandment and jesus said all the love the lord your god with all your heart seldom strength
343.77,348.39, and then he said interestingly the second is a lot like it love your neighbour as you love yourself
348.63,353.85, he laid it out there he said relationship with god love the lord god i heart holds them
353.94,357.93, love your neighbors yourself love each other being relationship with each other
358.11,365.1, and yet if you remember as we've gone through a fetishist half of a patient chapters one two and three we talked a ton about our relationship with god
365.28,386.76, we talked about all that god has done on our behalf he saw that we had an issue and he said i'm going to do something about that in chapter to talk about going from death to life and he saw the because of our sin going back to adam and eve therefore
387.24,397.14, we're made to be in relationship with him he and then that and did something to that relationship brought separation between us and from that moment god said i'm going to do something about that
397.17,408.9, i'm going to do something i take it upon myself to rescue them out of this place they put themselves in as we talk about infusion chapter one and to that he shows us that he brought us in a fine had adopted us
409.02,412.77, may his holy and blameless in crises sealed as with the holy spirit
413.73,417.09, in chapter two again he brought us from death to life
417.3,424.56, his free gift of grace to save us nothing that we can do to earn that but he said i'm going to do it i'm going to do the work to save you
425.58,428.31, to redeem you to bring you back to myself
428.37,431.79, bring you back into the relationship that you created to have with me
432.09,444.15, and then as we've been talking about a couple of weeks in chapters four and five it's this transition absence and letter were polite almost like he just gets in this list of ducados do this do this treat each other this way don't do this each other
444.42,450.63, began to communicate were lionship with each other again relationship with god relationship with others
451.41,459.45, as we read this passage i began to see what it looks like for us to be in relationship with each other
459.66,467.28, as we react to what god has done for us and how that affects how we treat each other as read this chapter two
468.66,473.13, chapter two verse forty two three forty seven
473.76,479.13, all the believers devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching into the fellowship
479.37,482.79, to sharing and meals including the lord's supper and the prayer
483.66,487.44, deep sense of all came over them all
488.07,506.43, and the apostle perform many miraculous signs and wonders and all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had they sold their property and possessions and share the money with those in need they worship together in the temple each day they met in homes for the lord's supper and shared their meals with great joy generosity
506.82,516.0, all the while praising god and enjoying the good will of the people and each day the lord added to their fellowship those who are being saved
516.3,520.44, a beautiful picture of the church the first church
520.53,526.05, in church the gathering of followers of christ the gathering of believers
526.23,529.38, for they've been called themselves christians this is what they look like
529.92,537.39, a just pride of this this is is is forty nine days since what we talked about last week forty nine days since jesus rose from the grave
537.69,546.36, about days with his disciples and with his followers re communicating the things that he had already said to them firming them and getting them ready because he was about to leave
546.9,551.31, days after his resurrection he ascended into the heavens
551.37,567.84, you read about that chapter one and he literally went up into the clouds and all the diverse are like what do we do now and the standing there in these two angels show on my gathered in your heads in the clouds go back to jerusalem and wait on me wait on him he's goin to send somebody to you
568.41,574.02, nine days later pentecost celebration the jews were having in jerusalem
574.11,577.83, spirit of god shows up in a new way to come and be with them
578.28,617.37, while lessen longer there with them the whole spirit comes to be with them and he empowers them in courage to start happening and all of a sudden they start telling the story and telling the truth about who christ was and what it is and thousands are being added to their numbers thousands are being added to their group onetho's closest followers he had a rough time around that whole crucifixion time and incident but judiciaire and encourage him say i got plans for you and so after us left peter's fired up and ready to go and preach the mating terminated their necks chapter two and they again thousands of people becoming become followers of christ
617.46,621.96, from about as a cry while jesus himself was here
621.99,626.76, leave the holy spirit comes and boom thousands of followers of christ
627.87,633.27, then accepted too began to see this picture this picture of what it looked like when they were together
633.48,637.17, they did live together the first community the first gospel community
637.29,638.91, see among christians
639.81,661.44, and so as we look at this there's things at three points kind of three and a half points but i'm going to say three points maelstrom the half later in later on but three points the thing we draw from its wischert thing it was it looked like to live and gospel community and honest this is the time of learning to think through a wood is this look like and how does this work
661.86,669.03, not a bolt we're going to talk about gospel community works with all of it has implications on you and how you live
669.36,679.8, we've been talking about relentlessly relational as we go through the book of hessians and if you remember we talked about you and me and us and him
680.04,694.68, and it's real easy as we go through to talk about stuff in listeners and thinking about me thinking about you but we think about ourselves and get self consumed they are there's a graphic souhaits really easy to think about you
695.01,699.81, sometimes i really and it's really seething about me sometimes i don't get past that
699.9,704.01, to think about god i relationship with him that's got to affect us
705.06,708.96, for truly interacting with a gospel it's going to eventually affect us
709.11,717.18, and so as we get into this point number one gospel community is a product of god's love gospel community
717.36,719.88, as a product of god's love
720.6,724.32, we see this in this act to passage
724.56,729.15, we see this that in response to what christ had done
729.57,733.17, response to what happened at days before
733.56,738.45, affected the way they treated each other as they experienced god's love
738.84,744.69, overwhelmed at change the way they acted on a day to day basis a change the way they related to each other
745.65,748.08, this love that changed them
748.59,757.95, as they proclaim the gospel of how much god loves them of how much what god had done on their behalf it changed the way they treated each other and interactive each other
759.09,767.25, what happens is in this the way i say it's a product the gods love because it's a natural outflowing when we experience god's love
767.34,770.22, just like i said it changes the way we view things
770.49,782.52, it changed the way we view ourselves again in relationship with god as that relationship grows it changes the way we view ourselves we go from being self consumed and narcissistic and all about us
783.36,792.12, to humbly about us let me explain it's when you begin to see yourself as god's creation
792.42,797.19, and you have a healthy appreciation for yourself as god's creation
797.76,802.56, not in an areaway like man look hazing i am all glory be to me
802.68,804.21, but like men
804.39,808.89, i appreciate what god has done and creating matthew young or insert your name
809.37,818.76, when you begin to see what god is done on your behalf to rescue you what he sacrificed for you he began to experience that he values you
819.63,823.23, again in a fusion chapter one he shows you
823.8,826.5, brought you into the family adopted you
827.01,829.2, sacrifice for you
830.16,835.29, when that begins to affect your thinking when that begins to affect your soul
835.32,837.54, changes the way you feel about yourself
838.08,846.72, again it doesn't lead to self glorification or to self loathing and beating yourself up
846.78,848.34, leads to like 
848.46,875.43, soldados made in me so we all have in part of just natural maturing as a person i began to have become more and more self aware to begin to recognize your personality traits and how they're different than others and but in god's love he began to say okasise for that if you had to look at your pet your life experiences from your past when babes will look at that and some that was hard simeuse that god has a purpose in all of those things that he can use all of that
875.43,898.23, you're gifting and even the skills that you acquire begin to say okay okay god's given me the village do these things and now may i want to use them to glorify god and i appreciate what he's done and allowed me to learn these things all of this is part of yourself learning but it's not in a way that says may and i'm amazing person everybody glorify me but it's lead you to say and i pushed one here
898.23,902.88, i feel loved i feel overwhelmed by what god has done and what he's done for me
902.97,910.47, rescue me out of death that i may have life and that he may use this use me use what he's made
910.56,915.99, god for glory creation praise god for creating me
916.02,918.87, in the humblest way you can believe and think that
920.19,926.49, and then what happens is when you begin to recognize that about yourself and you begin to see yourself as someone who is loved by god
926.79,933.81, you can't help but realize that the guy sitting next to that person sitting over that person across the room he created them to
933.96,941.76, all of that stuff about their unique individual and they have a personality and if things and experiences and all of the stuff they're unique to 
941.88,945.93, my goodness god is very creative composite made over there too
946.14,950.04, so not only to begin experienced god's love as you appreciate it
950.13,956.88, creation a new but then you began to experience god's love as you recognize and appreciate his creation in others
957.51,964.08, so you pass scripture that explains this and shows how this works and first john chapter four
964.35,982.86, a beautiful picture of how god's love works so i want to read this somewhere off the screen here first john for starting a very dear friends let us love one another for love comes from god everyone who loves has been born and knows god
984.12,995.73, he does not love does not know god because god is love god is love the only way we're going understand love is by knowing god again relationship with him
996.0,1000.68, all the way we're going to understand how to love one another as if we first experience loving him
1001.7,1003.5, experience his love
1004.91,1006.5, reading sorry
1007.04,1014.18, this is how god showed his love among us he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him
1014.54,1018.95, this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us
1018.95,1022.88, and his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins
1023.51,1025.04, difference
1025.04,1028.7, god so loved us we also ought to love one another
1029.06,1036.62, ever seen god but if we love one another god live in us and his love is made complete perfected
1036.95,1038.12, i 
1038.78,1042.35, the enemy saw that through their but god is love
1042.62,1044.81, we're called the love one another
1045.14,1047.84, the only way we know anything about love
1047.96,1049.16, from god
1049.52,1052.64, worship love we worship god god is love
1053.18,1054.92, love is not god okay
1055.31,1056.6, to strain
1057.65,1062.03, but in that we experienced god's love through him
1062.36,1069.44, his greatest act of love and batteries tissue so his greatest act of love when he said i this is what love looks like
1069.92,1077.63, to send my son for you i recognize that you guys are in trouble you had that sin thing going on in your headed towards death
1077.75,1088.73, his greatest act of love was giving part of himself his own son to die a sacrifice he sacrificed part of his his own self for us he gave that we would have
1089.21,1091.07, he gave for us
1092.51,1095.21, so he demonstrated his love in that
1095.33,1100.37, now there's that there's that troubling thing for us as people that no one's ever seen god
1100.7,1104.51, but as i said the first twelve if you if we love one another
1104.99,1107.69, his love is made complete and us
1109.73,1134.51, oftentimes we experience galore have this idea of experience in god's love and that i feel love or in a worse experience or a time of rescript or a time when you feel love by god again that when you recognize that got lueste it's an emotional feeling eatanswill is to it and your relationship with god it's all about just you
1135.11,1137.66, just me and what i'm getting out of it
1138.14,1141.44, love is done yet it's not made complete yet
1141.83,1147.86, not finished until it overflows out of your life and began to affect the lives of those around you
1148.28,1151.91, tell your relationship with god begins to affect your relationship with others
1152.51,1154.4, tell me about us
1155.09,1158.09, not perfected it's not done and something comes about us
1158.57,1161.33, and so gospel community
1161.36,1163.73, a product of god's love
1163.73,1168.47, we experienced god's love over flows out of our lives and in the lives of others
1169.1,1172.46, then you experiencing gospel community is what we see there in the book of acts
1172.64,1174.56, chapter two
1176.33,1181.19, the second point gospel community has sacrificial love
1181.76,1185.0, gospel community has sacrificial of
1185.27,1196.85, we saw it just in that passage in first john for that god's greatest act of love was when he was when he gave up so that we would have when he sent his son as a sacrifice for us
1197.48,1202.22, we see it throughout this passage in act to three that verse forty four
1202.43,1210.77, he says and all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had in the greek that were everything means everything
1210.8,1217.43, after you some greek or are they sold their property and possessions and share the money with those in need
1217.64,1224.18, worship together at the temple each day met in the homes for the lord speronare their meals with great joy and generosity
1224.66,1226.28, since hearts
1226.46,1234.65, everything they shared everything they obviously the one that stands out to us we say oh wow they were like seantum and providing for each other
1234.74,1251.21, they were shared their money they share their possessions they shared obviously sure their time their meeting the other daily they're getting together regularly they showed their time as should their space there having at each other each other's homes and say come on over let's eat they shared their food again their stuff
1251.24,1263.27, maybe i'm reading into this but i want to say that in everything they shared their emotions they should their feelings they should their fears they should their joys they shared everything they were together they met regularly they were involved each other's lives
1263.66,1266.39, i say hey that's getting to close gases
1266.42,1272.51, naebody said come on come on in bat's get to know each other let's do this together
1272.99,1277.67, in this with each other it's about us at this point it's not you and me
1279.74,1283.97, as the experienced god's love it affected the way they treated each other
1284.54,1290.93, there there at the end it said he had great joy since hearts
1291.26,1306.38, translation says they weren't coerced in this wasn't guilt driven it was like well guys you really should be sharing your food is like it here's my refrigerator it's open to you come on and let's eat come into my face and you have needs i see your needs i'm an help take care of them
1306.38,1309.41, it's a beautiful picture just like christ
1309.8,1321.8, he saw us god when he sees or issue a greatest issue of sin and separation from my that relationship with god i says i'm not okay with it i'm going to do something about it he saw need
1322.1,1324.86, what need to happen to take care of that need
1325.22,1331.67, early christians as first church this gospel community the exact same thing as they saw each other's needs they said i'm going to help take care of that
1332.12,1333.68, not back in away from it
1333.92,1336.17, step into that i'm going to help provide
1336.47,1340.28, those needs were as beautiful picture sacrifice
1343.88,1347.12, be a christian means to live a life of sacrifice
1347.66,1349.46, tea followed jesus
1349.49,1352.91, it means the sacrifice to give up for others
1353.24,1354.77, others may have
1355.34,1365.75, he constantly said stuff that reference this he said the first would be last the last will be first you must regularly daily die to yourself you must give up
1365.78,1366.89, others
1367.19,1377.69, lived that he displayed he calls us to walk in that i want to give you a chance here the thevenin at two to experience a little bit of sacrifice just a little bit
1378.56,1382.01, call us to seconds of sacrifice 
1382.52,1397.04, just a moment we're going to take seconds and i want you to pray for some one i want you to pray for the person on your left okay were as been thirty seconds praying for the person your left not you guys you have on this far side of the auditorium on the far
1397.04,1415.46, far left you guys over here you have a task that you have to pay for the people all the overturn the end of this row because they don't have to be fandor them okay you kind o look over there you get a feel for who's over there and see onaparte first on your left you guys are going all the way across i'm going to pay for the god to sound but on
1415.85,1423.05, a small sacrifice what you're going to get thirty seconds of your mental capacity thirty seconds of prayer
1423.14,1428.42, not for you too often we spend time trying for ourselves here's been ends of praying for someone else
1428.48,1433.91, you're going to ask you're going to go to god and ask them this god help them to understand how much you loved them
1434.93,1440.18, to understand a growin an understanding of how much you love them
1440.54,1446.03, i know everybody here i may not dismay me the first time you better said prayer life here in just a minute it's okay
1446.24,1453.5, for you know you have not your praying for just ask god to help this person on your left to understand how much
1453.83,1455.81, he loves them all 
1455.81,1457.43, you have seconds
1457.79,1460.4, get set
1467.96,1471.47, just give up seconds to your day for somebody else
1471.68,1479.51, ay that was simple and i help lead you in that really well recognised you can do that whenever
1479.78,1486.2, in simple stuff like prayers and big stuff like giving your time and your space providing for others needs
1486.83,1491.12, as a simple act of just saying what about somebody else what about us
1491.45,1492.86, not all about me
1494.3,1502.7, the sacrifice that cascade as much greater than that and he's regularly the scriptures say he's regularly doing that for us interceding in our behalf
1502.85,1504.23, for us
1505.1,1510.71, to pray for one another for us to experience with god is done and half i pray that that would happen someone else's life
1512.06,1516.74, he who we are church of sacrifice the regular walks in the
1517.07,1521.18, welcome the opportunity to give up to help someone else
1521.81,1526.34, the third point gospel community brings glory to god
1527.21,1538.04, gospel community brings glory to god and parenthetically gospel community brings people to god that's the point five three point five gospel committed brings people to gain
1540.5,1552.17, see there at the end of that chapter to passage i said as people were watching this there was a sense of the beginning of that passage in forsythe as there was a sense of all
1552.47,1556.91, people were experiencing what was going on they were in all of what was happening
1557.93,1572.06, and then at the end of that you begin to see how it affected those who were experiencing this how they were seeing it that all the while praising god and enjoying the good will of all the people in each day the lord added to their fellowship those who are being saved
1572.84,1576.44, this gospel community man people are like i want to be a part of that
1576.74,1585.62, experience the love of god as they heard the gospel preach and taught and clarified to them and they would step into the cask communion they would be saved they would be added to those numbers
1585.8,1595.34, we saw that jesus did this actually we saw him display this there's a sweet story and in lucerne were

1963.44,1977.51, back in the book of a vision we looked at this couple weeks ago and at this prayer is paul and his letters making this transition from talking about our relationship with god began in to talk about our relationship with each other
1977.87,2010.27, begins to talk about a relation with each other again as josh preached two weeks ago through weeks ago those two sermons where it looked like a list of rules these things how we treat each other and horspittle each other not steal from each other don't let don't send in your anger and then he talks about don't have any sexual morality among you and how you use your mouth and all of these things all of that literators how we relate to one another it's not just about you and it's not just about me it's about us
2011.98,2014.77, protecting the community the gospel community
2015.13,2023.74, i think that at the point of paul when he when he became a christian prior prior to that they called him so
2024.07,2037.63, i was in jerusalem and a short to place he was somewhere else becoming really smart in judaism rather began to hear rumors about what was going on there and he was like no no i'm not okay with that they're doing something different than we've ever done it before
2038.32,2046.27, he says i'm going to do something about it he oversees the persecution of the first christians in the first martyrs were done under his watch

2051.22,2056.86, paul held their soul held the coats of those who were doing the stoning
2057.7,2071.77, love it so much and he wanted to see it happened so much that he got permission to go throughout ancient israel pursuing these christians persecuting them and having them arrested in seeing that they were killed in the process of doing that jesus met him and said i'm not okay with this paul
2072.04,2074.02, something different with your life

2081.64,2086.32, sacrifices his life planting churches like the one at ephesus
2086.77,2091.39, and i think that he probably had its image in her stories of a chapter to
