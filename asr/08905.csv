8.13,9.84, is your question
12.57,18.09, the fire my best option for survival will be driving away at the first sign of smoke
18.54,23.91, standing in the middle of an entire like an oval or field sheltering in the bathroom
24.63,26.37, reliving room
27.12,29.58, into a pool or a water tank
44.1,49.35, the trees the same droning away soon as i see smoke
51.81,54.06, the big one really is one
54.06,59.16, to be issue of the united stylehurst
59.25,64.35, i guess it's a talk around the issue of little but i think we've got to appreciate that there are
65.61,72.78, treasures of any go into further fuel is one of them and we have a lot of emphasis on the fuel because it's something we can manage
72.9,84.51, the other is that energy coming from the weather itself so the strength of the wind draws of the wind and the baltimore is actually energy in that dedicate much fuel to have a father to be leslie
84.51,86.4, the one is the topography
87.51,102.03, i guess what we looking at her is making some of these decisions when attender stand how each other specters playing out her training in the middle of an evil for example when it the wind is sixty kasana's forty five degrees and
102.12,105.63, i think he still may be in a dangerous location
106.65,114.78, the side of you've got moisture and the atmospheric ability to think for behavior and on black head we had made basically now moist because of the
114.78,121.98, i read and we had incredible instability in the atmosphere which is alas a conviction called to form
122.04,126.96, for behint just all that fuel to last four other maids effects
127.02,133.17, in making the decision there about what you're going to do in terms of your responsible depend on how it those
133.17,138.03, going to fix you where your house is where you haven't i believe at particular time
138.87,152.64, just for this was really choice between sort of the west repairing there were there in placed a continual issues about why i tithings
152.7,156.0, and then eustace
156.39,158.7, on a smile
158.91,163.68, elstrick me as well once you oucanasta
164.04,168.66, often had not its already to right to make a decision about
168.69,171.84, about moving to a safe place
173.07,175.95, endlessly
176.13,186.39, we of where the fire is and we your extend the danaidae clear and the united ritidian hilarities
186.69,189.84, in reality he said my time
189.96,198.0, it must also not my brother man and bit of an issue that every one in the town was on the same smoke have a few rafters
199.05,201.99, that's true as well so it's
202.65,207.6, i like a bit of retraction from masefield
207.78,214.95, standing anywhere it inside a carefree in the arena i be inside a house before 
215.13,218.82, orations there is not a beanfield
219.45,223.8, so institootions is her one door
223.98,229.02, it's where a lot of people do find themselves trapped in a structural far
229.29,230.7, and in
231.81,235.02, of people and lose their lives in houses
235.38,237.21, in
237.6,240.03, after in fact in the bar so
240.12,245.97, the showing that they do have a sense of the time frank and before passing a structure
246.15,248.1, they're not
248.1,253.38, allowing themselves to continually monitor the fabii
253.38,256.26, the wind is to the house to
256.29,258.48, nippon where
260.07,266.64, an opportunity to move on to burgomaster from passes from when the house accounts the far
269.07,272.43, that something would show awfully
272.61,278.22, i guess the less the falls was the living ring as many
278.4,282.99, more than one door and in fact i be riding around the house
284.1,286.02, monitoring
287.07,290.67, we britishers coming
290.7,293.37, happening out in the house is it
296.46,297.33, but
297.72,300.6, all says when you're out in the open again
300.72,306.39, there are some private notes about living in those circumstances but
306.78,312.45, hiroshima a half erasistratus any night
315.3,327.63, i think it was the makassar every complex problem missile solution and as usually wrongdoing this is is this is actually a new discussion
327.75,328.89, i think
329.31,332.34, for paper toward simplistic outside
333.78,335.91, i think that's going to be part of the community
335.91,344.73, prices is sitting down and sarcenets look at your house let's look at the situation and having a set of plans by scorn
344.79,354.45, he what we do know from the ideational intriguante is that people are actually able to consider multiple series
354.63,358.59, i have planned a plan and the plan and played the
358.83,364.11, situation is and be pretty good at deciding which of this it is
364.38,367.11, does that you have to have the dollars
367.11,368.55, he actually
368.85,373.83, recipes to acknowledge that the
375.63,380.43, but what i was wrong with the idea that he my plan is
380.49,385.35, is going to be really had but the big north wind and the temperature rising ungenerous
386.01,396.27, and a good irresoluteness in carinthia should be content any one should do it on to make their own position in
396.75,405.0, a bicycle that broiling advice sanitation think it's a one size fits all solution
406.26,413.28, white rudiger lies and i know the attraction of simplistic solutions to policy by us
413.49,423.12, castlemartin it's a weekend problem and i don't think we can aforetime solutions despite the appeal and despite
423.93,426.87, in a piece between states
427.44,430.44, community about pretending that such
431.58,433.56, cantharides
434.1,445.08, i think one of the interesting things that came out at which barracoons that the counsel of sitting in that he commission was very strong on the idea that he should evacuate with those earth afar in an area
445.11,451.98, the commission themselves the trinities basically decided now that the one side was all that going to work
452.34,456.6, there was a significant value of the existing policy
456.75,474.09, and ellesmere inforced in support of robotics sary trentisoe in different and equally bad sort of putting the plain the or commission given all the evidence they there receive bothersome living in as far parvient or that the time he spent thinking about this
474.18,489.0, antithesis which is in mandragore for causes and stubbly what's appropriate to you in your location at that time the situation was no we often done scale the problem that is wait is cool what called the fallacy of corporation
489.0,492.78, it may be good for me to depart rapidly in
492.81,505.53, but if a habitable do that with his cook everyone in cars on the road so there are the scaling issues about what happens on the individual level and if we scareth committed little man or work at all
505.68,507.27, the
507.27,511.68, she detailed discussion of pultowa would happen if everybody did
512.07,520.02, what would be the consequences the arlington the answer of your saying as we need to think very carefully about the office
521.22,527.46, an you got your chance to answer you ask your questions very soon before that old couple more questions
528.93,541.47, a sufficient time to leave one i see smoke and at folwell thad a few clothes on this one estate
542.31,544.59, been listening
547.41,554.22, just then he read we have one more i think
556.98,561.33, planned preparation for staying in defending
577.26,580.08, well what do you think 
580.17,594.51, i think it's pretty wise pantheistic said nothing one of the things drew sign before his plan i veinstone think well the best thing for me will be to do that if that doesn't work and do something
594.54,595.74, and
595.8,602.13, allenquer of options which are equally foible in different circumstances
602.31,608.94, on themselves into an auditories chances 
609.09,612.48, you expect a 
612.84,618.96, teasing up in the result he the tale actually sort of amastan there
619.68,621.9, fiona
622.05,627.0, it is the species it so it is it's not the 
627.09,644.13, even with a broad spread i guess i ever won the day in all that very well and do nothing to aid ostheim where you guys get the cousin so were i think will
644.4,649.95, a couple of months maybe get some mark refines into the audience there
653.88,656.01, we question obstinate
656.64,662.07, the keel i got to
662.1,667.89, then the german one of the time will be good now
668.04,670.2, the first thing that
670.2,671.7, coming up 
672.81,676.2, i guess as to things one is the householder
676.23,679.14, responsible for the far into their property
679.92,681.42, the idea that you
684.78,688.32, it's not so late anyway you have to be so
688.65,690.24, at
691.32,693.39, i have one
694.08,697.71, crossing a population of australia to time
697.77,700.71, when the climate is becoming more pitiable
701.46,705.99, cosmopolitan suburbs in the bush
710.82,713.31, is there a plan
715.23,719.58, so that before himself arose out of the book
720.21,722.04, it
722.43,724.95, that was all part of his
725.64,728.94, catharine
729.27,737.49, so is your question may be legislation of things with it developing new properties out in the suburbs where the loading and 
737.64,742.02, but the visitor account i guess it's goin to say there was one of the proper recommendations of the 
742.08,750.24, which is to say this place to be part of the lentil bit on the property therein all the rest like this ere
751.38,755.58, with this is this is the bush fires this is what you take on so of france
755.67,765.96, leatherin too i think the devils could have been the detail of that and can you read the consultant who cutliffe conclusion and there's going to be a whole bunch of
766.5,768.51, and
769.38,778.47, i will have to deal with evolution validity and reliability in severance and from a that was one of the recommendations of loving of inherited or denied that there i think
781.32,786.81, your first question was about responsibility for your own property the anyone would another one
788.07,810.45, and with the heligolanders family heretofore many victoria augusta a difference between whether our vistas on your property and the responsibility have there and with her our fire is actually passing through a property which casey wouldn't missus here have that responsibility so
810.51,822.42, outside you probably victoria then you don't have any lies the responsibility opposing through your property but you are not sure opposition in east
822.9,824.13, a similar
824.28,828.84, i 
836.04,839.79, one
840.03,847.74, there are responsibility legal responsibilities for preventing the spread of fatherland actually stopping the fire
848.22,851.73, for fatiguing the preventive work
852.78,855.42, your property and surroundings
856.5,862.05, legal operation is fascinating eveques tion upstairs
866.85,873.54, at morrisania going on from the issue of benton for fencing
873.6,878.46, time from to solitariness very complex
878.52,886.83, there are a lot of factors that need to be considered in the licentiate but one of the things that i think is common to all but
886.83,889.2, the prevention measures
889.26,894.9, that there are some practical things that can be done to encourage clarions
894.99,906.21, would be to assist people to do cleaning out and the moment we got to a dead line that govern now when combination
906.39,910.29, and our two elected line people are encouraged to do that
910.62,918.36, once well within the faineant been off it does become more difficult to play your property
918.54,926.52, all incentives that licenses and other generalities correctly make to assist people don't declare their property for
926.52,939.51, things to what he does or charging crispation or otherwise of disposing a wise and other fuels around and properties
943.74,950.28, just going to say that they always cost before the vileness that is it's easy to solve the problem but he made an
951.06,956.49, what beneath getting what's the cost for the reproductive verses
957.3,962.22, duchatelet in and i think in many cases communities don't
962.55,969.12, courage the corn of initiative he talking about because the opportunity cost of dividing the money to that particular
969.12,980.16, it has to be taken away from somewhere else or we have to increase services and charges so i think it's again it's an old believer difficult political question i don't think we live in an era where
980.46,982.29, by then the problem
982.38,989.82, reindeer are limited resources and we have to think of my smile and clever always i think how do we
990.21,1004.04, programs of created cities behavioral level for people to water clean up their properties or to stare so that at whitecoat the fire stuffed out so i think we have to think about how do we invest the resources not just go to that
1004.22,1005.27, for
1005.9,1020.18, i think it's a really difficult issue because the consent the money of that age are facility they are the rival the disciple people or somebody else will say that many would be better spent on reproduction without borrowin your pro
1020.24,1028.46, if you use the fuel then that has already had an effect on luminaries
1028.97,1033.14, stand that but try to get it if you think about for a risk perspective
1033.68,1037.1, he of the fire coming through that individual's property
1037.52,1038.99, the prime
1039.11,1040.49, the lawyer
1040.55,1047.51, the cost of doing that to everybody and all the time a part of cost to the community that that can actually otway the costs
1047.57,1054.29, having the father are complex decisions that have to be made here the most people did the thing about risk
1054.59,1058.61, it's just oh that's the problem fixing
1059.09,1062.24, actually created different problems they have not
1062.45,1069.59, to and by the fire for quitting else so you're always beating off these very conflicts equations
1070.46,1074.69, and i don't think they are necessary just simple justice and all go away
1074.96,1079.04, complex a water retired problems that they
1079.19,1085.28, at a multi discipline ringing and much more particles anticipate sense of community
1086.63,1095.75, did you want that the challenge did you want a had something to that calotin what this is bringing out and jerome's the very end they which is really important that
1095.96,1100.82, a pretty good putting right red tracks are on the road and dusk
1100.85,1121.67, at the erring and good interplanting we go to providing information of what we have been secrets really getting that social interaction going and i think a lot of what suggesting in a way requires what dress sort of all states basically giving some agreement about how important is this compared with other testimonies a real social issue then and
1121.88,1129.65, i guess coming from victor outside you know air for agencies have been fantastic attaint up beside produced
1129.68,1142.19, nation but dealing at the social level went very good at him and i guess the which by say i say when it got going into heaven three one of the areas that sort concentrate on asasiel sidinane really
1143.9,1157.85, pontegrave one in terms of air what we're doing there is discomfit for us and unless we go down that social lines whenever going to solve this problem it's not a physical issue
1158.51,1161.72, question does it
1162.5,1163.79, wondering just
1165.08,1168.56, the messages from ten
1168.71,1170.84, mitigated
1171.86,1187.73, came have octogenarians that adeimantus the hiding in the bathroom teotihuacan
1188.21,1189.17, that is
1190.67,1194.48, maybe the houses in
1194.96,1200.18, automatically become really dangerous places to be in a certain point
1200.18,1201.62, the 
1202.58,1205.91, there are reliable temporary refuge
1207.65,1211.37, some better option and to start
1211.37,1214.04, when i inwented
1214.46,1215.87, last
1218.15,1219.56, are
1219.68,1223.55, no i think one of the mess that we
1223.67,1225.29, to deal with
1225.29,1235.85, one of the misses conventually big chalcidice which is that the emergency services more has predominated in this area either ask fifty to a hundred years
1236.3,1243.38, the nest be supplemented and its one way we blow for a position if i have going to be rescued
1243.92,1245.0, one
1245.54,1248.63, community these themselves as part of the
1248.78,1254.0, to have to missionary quickly and
1254.27,1258.17, the doll that on the widower that happens to
1258.29,1268.13, but but they will be a sense of the americain partnership around this we let work on it together as a group and we will give to a nation of
1268.13,1272.45, i would see where the traditional fire brigades
1273.53,1276.8, will become more of community development
1276.95,1282.86, a role in building in developing community and educational rolls and not just
1283.1,1289.55, he is coming to rescue you on the day of it is always going to be wroth for that but this going to be a much broader community development
1290.21,1294.62, i think when you get to that we will have used the biggest miss
1297.56,1299.39, upstairs
1300.86,1310.49, one of the things mannstein information to you hawthorne the fire is what it's doing those sorts of things
1310.73,1316.64, almost a need for some sort of real time of the tracking system
1316.76,1320.75, i like omelettes
1322.04,1332.84, that people can go to i mean even if during a fire there's usually still some sort of internet connection by you know foreign or you can call up someone or something along those lines
1333.41,1335.72, bearing formation and
1335.72,1337.34, more people
1339.59,1347.57, totalitarians er is he has something of painting a far behind yet more if you like and muller
1348.02,1352.07, in extent but good information is always better than any good modeling
1352.13,1353.63, i guess we
1353.9,1360.95, a month in the recommission found who still finding out what actually happened on likewise that within minutes if you like
1360.98,1363.5, they speak from all sorts of platforms
1363.62,1372.08, some of the technology is already used in some of the military application is used the sort of terrorist part situations
1372.2,1376.76, we really not using it very well and i got seven the fire agencies
1376.88,1379.76, the thought is done really now
1380.03,1383.0, he maintained it
1383.06,1391.46, and so at anyrate really got to work on his getting whether to blow calls coming from way towlinson to fault were
1391.46,1401.06, to back radio people providing messages or used titans of things ameraunt harnessing that is its scary that the technology they are we can do that
1401.36,1404.84, some you think should be able to the public as well as to the
1405.14,1415.04, this is a partnership where were actually trying to solve his problem together so hoosheroon but the job for if you like the the agencies is to 
1415.07,1427.64, filter invalidate some of the information rather destroy a whole lot of information on the issues of using some of we had dogmatising for example wearily get all sorts of information on it useful some not 
1428.12,1430.34, individual you can't make that assessment
1430.49,1434.06, we made systems implies to actually be able to do some of that filtering
1438.71,1444.65, a tarasconade laperouse not enough quite piteous
1444.8,1452.93, kamehameha i think there's going to be a lot of discussion about the use of technology dotation to pay to
1453.05,1463.25, now a lot of race it you know the areas about this so for example if you met the scenario where we have some super dupotet message existed the situation is danger will robinson
1464.18,1477.35, what would happen in the event of the signal distribution that is a signal to noise risotto high that is too many people were alerted and marchesas a tenth time or had that in the war
1478.16,1481.52, alas no it tomposity
1481.91,1485.06, and people have what i call in complacency as
1485.6,1488.9, if you don't get a message oh i must be safe
1489.92,1495.53, i think we have to be really sophisticated in the understanding is that these are very human systems
1496.01,1498.68, yes give everybody takes message well
1499.76,1505.37, but the agitated have very clear understanding of how
1505.61,1515.12, normander in forming a half papson to the history of information actually distorts their decision making it not necessarily in the wide
1516.14,1519.71, and there's a lot more than just
1519.8,1528.53, lawford about impending events i think this augmentation can all about my blazing
1528.71,1530.6, that informs
1530.6,1532.82, to assist the ingress
1534.77,1542.33, about you know i imagine if you can gain cleinias property and so
1542.36,1546.95, what was faring united property and and how that 
1547.1,1554.48, the beeman hegesander stand where they tagliamento
1554.75,1562.76, because there anaesthetised and spiteful knowledge and
1562.85,1565.31, knowledge that were you
1565.64,1569.78, everything putting it all in the public to mine and my losing paul
1569.99,1572.57, the more informed decisions about their iris
1572.75,1577.07, that's real time and study information
1577.19,1588.41, suggesting that maybe the united house would burn down on a control burning one of the waiting questions or much thersites
1590.9,1601.88, one wondering if these insignificance that shows us that fire in night envitation is less dangerous or more dangerous than fire and on it a vegetation
1603.89,1608.6, interesting question and the interesting existed
1609.02,1619.28, it's all different and it is this really did not iteration in his really bad meditation
1619.4,1620.96, a good and
1621.23,1627.53, matabeleland mesquite beats
1627.95,1631.76, as a general rule not dedication
1632.18,1636.95, this is densemore far dated the analysis
1637.13,1639.05, in the fall into
1639.08,1644.87, of coming from rage is that all from
