13.2,15.69, nature equals future
16.26,18.51, the saviour tree
20.25,49.74, amongst the various national strategies used to capture carbon aside a european study which draws on the work of professor arrived kia highlights the capabilities of certain trees okolona trees like the hero count in the cameroon and ivory coast these trees transform sealed to in a limestone slab beneath the soil by making use of this property which also improved so equality it is also possible to create an implement innovative projects and adrift
53.01,79.11, lecointre photosynthesis leaves among other things to the formation of oxalic acid or oxalate this acid will eventually be moved to the roots of the tree will be used by different soil micro organisms such as bacteria and bunyan will be decomposed into carbon and in
79.17,141.72, these carbon and ions will react with the calcium iron to form calcium carbonate the scientific name of limestone this calcium carbonate precipitates and become solid in the soil it accumulates over time it is an interesting process in terms of carbon sequestration since the tree like the rogation capture or store twenty one kilos of so to of carbon dioxide per year limestone slab can remain in the soil for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it really is a very very long term type of carpenter carbon sequestration technology is very interesting because it is very simple to implement since it is a low cost technology finally oxcart improve soil quality in terms of fertility such a process in addition to sequester in carbon set up a complete aberford system surrounding exogenous trees
142.32,160.17, on this principle the bill menecrates sociation and the green loop company created the oberseers project the saviour tree in height the purpose of this project is to implement a reforestation and agricultural program around the minutenesses america
164.13,180.87, but no it anastasia tion we thought it interesting to be violence fired to be visited in other words to have a visitant with trees to produce an agriculture which works better and without a new chemical emperor this means planting more more trees which we now have a positive effect on the climate
181.29,261.3, he wanted to work with associations and already planetrees in the country we were fortunate to find two in haiti that were already working towards that concluding a small association founded by a haitian and america which had already planned to a few my nut trees without knowing about their closeness effect it is the tree with the biggest oxygenate tial plain american but the main aspect for haiti right now is its nutritive because it produces a small nuts although they are what we would call not the important aspect is to see inside which can be dried by coffee beans for example on matthes are things that haitians are cubans now by heart when tried it can be ground into flour it can be used in all of the dishes from local cuisine we encourage women to take up the case to follow the training and run things in the house because this is where they can for example give a little water to a young tree that needs it we encourage them to have a maximum of five to ten trees in the garden by telling them that if they manage to make them grow they will be enough for them when it comes to the trees the benefits for the haitian people are that hates one of the country's most affected by deforestation since the beginning of this reforestation program in late two thousand and eleven we have planted one hundred thousand trees in various grounds the first results came in early two thousand fifteen just over three years after the first seeds were planted we had the first knot or seats
261.6,277.23, so we have a tree that was planted late that is already produced seats this is absolutely amazing it really proves that the trees adapted very well to the haitian land now we begin to have haitian seeds they should people can see that the trees produce seeds and meant them
278.52,285.33, i met approach based on echo system knowledge and built on the principle of local circular economy
285.42,287.1, or so
