61.47,71.13, novel adaptation of the movie and we had been for several years around the neighborhood just into video making videos video cameras
71.31,74.1, doing stupid skits and movies and
74.25,75.99, were he
76.08,87.72, to fill a hat band movie you know couple things happened in the immersing the batman suit for christmas i think
87.9,105.51, then it was like on because we had what we thought at the time was as you know a bad asset in bad man so suddenly chip and i really kind of took up this one into dorman movie and we just decided to make it
105.84,112.08, reed and a good way we decided to do one like a real costume like real special effects
112.29,128.88, and as many actors as we could find in our neighborhood when we had no budget you know we just were making stuff up so we're using like people's houses and
129.27,130.08, now
130.23,138.09, much like your deck your basement you're out you're living room you know we just watched it hipponous watched it and it's kind of funny how many things

155.85,157.98, be happier some place else
158.91,166.8, talk about a speller they be happier some myself
166.92,169.35, tobacco
176.1,178.5, he
179.94,195.06, teetering sticks out from behind the scenes for me is
195.63,198.18, we get all these kids to want to do this
198.24,211.5, charles has been temple rebecca bullet by wooden you know courtney flemming lantier like why are these kids want to do this with us and how did we convince them our neighborhood
211.53,219.39, a really special place we had in the movies we had you know people
219.75,251.22, you know high school and tenth grade although we down the like elementary school kids but it just felt more like a family if we were all brothers and sisters we were pretty close given that we had no training that we did this for fun that we did it from elementary school the high school the affinities and another
251.43,294.33, all the kids over there at night i don't know where parents were or where my parents were and we are re creating that access chemicals seeing what you remember from the timber and amandus where the joke or becomes the joker raither rosanette
295.08,315.54, wanted to keep going like i think it's good enough it's actually got enough really now this is actually a coherent telling of the story and while there are some parts of it for sure we want to go back and like red and make it better to pretty nicely
315.72,317.4, and
317.88,332.82, and that's kind of the charm of it i think i antonio you listen to like jarocho stories
333.06,339.3, very similar to chip and i i'm somehow we didn't end up doing that there was no like
339.81,345.0, personal like oh you guys are great or he let's take your natural kind of raw
345.09,349.86, and like develop it i wish we can finish it which we had finished it
349.86,367.71, i think the reason we probably didn't and we just got older there were always other things and there were always going to be other things but i think what i would tell myself if i could go back in time i say you can do all those other things but still make time to go off like still make time to grab the camera and go do things
367.71,369.18, but i would say
369.21,375.39, you are creative you designed and made to be creative
375.45,390.0, i believe in that i think if we had sort of made kept the crude together so to speak i would have been interested to see what we could have turned out you know when we were sixteen seventeen eighteen years old because we were doing pretty cool stuff when we were leaving twelve thirteen
390.12,426.06, you know we're still relatively young you never know what might happen to
