0.42,7.89, he 
7.95,13.92, i i
21.84,27.3, i became involved with the gography first
28.86,39.03, i have an eradication by too got an antithesis telegraph by
39.18,44.88, things in my world that were interesting to me by my bedroom and things like that and then
45.12,49.02, when i do and i really got started with bogeys
49.17,53.79, about fourteen years old i used to raise the faces
53.85,57.12, the state champion in ohio for four years and
57.33,61.44, i like anybody to day necator kids dey like to
61.68,67.38, when like photographs and omething with their found in our
67.59,74.91, jump and stuff like what i was when i was fourteen we at the same and away by
75.66,92.7, the document what we were doing and elegantly did jumps who wanted to photograph them so to prove that we did it and to the back then there was no desiccate there was nothing it was just thirty five meters actually had no how to take a fixture in our work after that 
92.73,95.58, how i got like
95.64,99.09, o my friends doing their you know kate
99.99,102.27, i like 
102.93,106.38, the point that i realized poison be
106.47,109.68, think i did for the rest of my life was
110.16,114.18, a kind of whitehouse i really wasn't 
114.57,118.11, soon as i got into a funny when i actually i 
118.11,121.35, taking a photo class in his flasher was a
122.1,154.95, was it the last semester of the day it was known that the latter early signed into the classroom could go into the dark room and before the turn the lights out outspeak up the back door go and leave school and that and that's what i would do and so everybody knew that night the rest like a photo glasslike sneak out and so for one reason or another i think that i stayed a few times and i started to do it i liked it and i had a teacher named michael mc clure that was really 
155.16,158.61, really amazing pointed out to me that i
158.67,160.44, doing something
160.44,167.97, different than his other students and that that i had a skill in ography that hadn't seen before and 
168.12,172.17, very much help me in income such anointing it in
172.26,178.32, you know in a theft in love with it in now by the end of that mastery was the lithography and
178.47,185.61, never done anything since that point and the way that works in the united states is left usually you go to an undergraduate school
185.73,200.49, there for four years and then you then later on you can graduate school and then so after i was in boston and i graduated from that fool i worked for two years for a photographer named john goodman i was atheistic
200.49,210.12, that was a really great experience because i know in school the one thing they know teach you and i guess they are you know catherine is like a
210.21,213.9, place of business in the
213.93,226.11, to get things done and then after working for a couple of years when i ended up a frind to graduate school i went an that's what i went to california and at the california college of the arts
226.14,227.52, where i
227.58,230.31, countermand
230.46,236.25, tedious and i was very
236.46,244.38, a thing like this kind of in retrospect it was very anaitis very lucky time to hate work with him at that point this he had
244.47,252.6, a book petersham and that what was out the world in italian of him but i saw her a show that he was in
252.66,256.05, pleasures and terrors of domestic oftener
256.26,275.52, ormond that it was not for a section of his work in the immediately caught my attention and that but then when i went to school with him and study with him that the body of work was finished it was the books were published book was published in the shows were all run he was kind of in between projects and 
275.7,277.32, a very
277.86,289.23, in retrospect the very fortunate find of the working with somebody that have em as my adviser because he was very available now a was also on the hunt himself for
289.41,293.61, for like his next project of what he was going to up doing 
293.67,297.84, so i kind of got to i had the available teacher
298.02,306.75, was also engaged in finding something for himself so it was really an there was a lot of back and forth between us you know we always talked about that 
307.05,313.47, we got as much from me as i got em with tell me now and which i was honoured by
315.09,319.89, a really great time ended up going on doing the boy
319.89,322.65, a riot like the last 
323.04,326.61, rotated doing that work
334.65,339.39, i think that i think led larry
340.83,347.01, the way he influenced me as i think that he taught me to the draw from within but i work
347.07,350.94, taught me to very much trusted my intuition
350.97,359.1, like go with that kind of got feeling about my work and then the other major thing that he pointed out to me was that
359.61,362.07, i have been making pictures of 
362.79,366.99, yes of a house i made some pictures of anterior
367.08,369.78, he was the one that pointed out to me that like
369.81,372.33, i was photographing architecture
372.48,375.87, billings or home or whatever he
375.87,378.57, some that it was something that i
379.02,382.62, making pictures about places that talk about people
382.68,389.4, the pictures were not architectural pictures they were not you topographic photographs they were
389.52,398.97, a psychology in that was really like i think the biggest gift that he gave me was the point that out of my work and he encouraged at my work to
400.08,407.43, i am yes i like sometimes the way it works for me how i start a subject for a start
407.58,410.91, something like a for instance like i was
411.0,414.69, houses at night that was something that the sortie
415.14,419.01, one day i went i needed a picture of a 
419.82,423.78, establishing shot or a sequence of pictures i was doing and
423.93,427.53, oh how it will be perfect be like the
427.83,440.61, house that the people are in but the sequence i was working on for an assignment and then but found this place it was on and have naturally lit up by hard hardish crossed the street
440.67,444.33, all the light that was flashing on to this
444.36,446.13, out and 
446.13,450.09, so i was kind of perfect and so i photograph that and then
450.27,455.25, had that one extended on and i was doing other nunlike
455.31,462.09, then i ended up about a world again driving around like going out and driving around really like
462.3,466.11, by way of making it like my favorite thing to do i
466.5,475.26, that the far river and on soil and our another one now in the life but a graphite
475.35,480.06, slowly but surely i found this neighbourhood that was
480.12,484.65, very much like a spotlight and it was also really falling
484.65,496.95, i member when i ever forget when i came up the hill to that neighborhood into the fog was like the rows usurious and i was refractory and easier thinking like
497.04,502.65, the people here so dark like literally like
502.65,519.36, across the street like now a third of the year as it was so foggy so ended up making the testator a long time and that was a kind of an accident and then in terms of how i encountered interiors same thing an i was like i think i was in a
519.45,523.89, a trip and i photographed the hotel room that i was staying
523.89,527.82, look up in the morning the light coming in the room
527.88,532.47, like sitting across the bed looking at the light amazing it was a
532.65,539.16, making a picture there that was kind of how that was the start of me doing it hurries and 
539.61,545.85, then with the landscapes are clearly remember the way that happened as it was then
546.57,550.26, scouting around during the farther phs
550.53,555.63, the girl back the for some places to go back to at night to take pictures of
555.69,560.73, i stopped at a stop sign there was in the winter time he stopped the stop sign then
560.88,566.73, he was you know a bunch of like snow that i felt an utopian intent
566.73,569.25, what a rush down the wind shield
569.4,578.73, and for a stupid and i now lamberlong at that and seeing this kind of suburban scene like dooming her to being like
578.97,581.1, was of like memory
581.16,596.28, then i am up grab my camerieri one frame and a which is what i have never do one frame you know and i easiest than i am on but when i got back and i saw the contact set
596.4,600.33, and i realized i saw there was something there that was very different then
600.54,603.51, before 
604.47,608.55, for that operator and then it's just like with any
609.03,615.33, i think with for me i can collotype but i think i have this is a seed the alabaster
616.41,625.05, photography is the medium is a serial kind of media the medium were like an often doing you make a picture that you like
626.46,631.11, the best thing to do is to go out and fight a make that picture again
631.26,635.76, never recreate make something different it has variation to it
635.97,637.95, onyegin
638.01,647.55, that ultimately he went up with a bunch of pictures that have the feeling or seem to them but they're not all quite the same and that a
647.94,651.12, one of the things i always say to my students is that 
651.15,655.23, ography like repetition is our enemy and
655.23,658.44, something that you have to kind of like you have to be
659.82,664.53, it is enough to be consistent follow rue and make a body of work
664.53,677.46, if you're you're too repetitious or in the thomahlians about finding that balance and something that you can everybody of work as its own balance in
677.7,686.37, bonaventure and a set of things for the entire arena that an
687.96,696.57, for their work and that there are other things where you know i've got a body of work or foreclose on briony made thirteen photographs and
696.57,699.0, as
699.39,700.83, perfect
701.04,709.05, so the weather has been really like something that's been important to me in no backandforth eaten
709.05,712.29, not at the goorashee
712.29,717.51, those are the great drama those things equal drama and that's the kind of thing that
717.69,722.88, aromatic picture that as some feeling motions
724.56,726.66, the way that
726.9,733.29, how fiction allonby work or with the role that fiction plays in my work
733.32,735.63, the resting habeas
735.78,737.04, sort of
739.41,743.46, some reason when i photographing a landscape where a photographing of building
743.55,747.45, have this old sol kind of notion of
747.6,755.79, think that i don't i regard asked somebody to turn the light on in the house and i don't say he loved her any man out of the driveway and
755.97,765.54, i asked that osbaldistone that the landscape for i don't arrange it i carried like
765.63,768.78, the king by that roar for myself where i just
769.26,775.17, furtive something instead of making it happen and then 
775.5,778.59, then with landscape pictures
778.68,781.2, irenita
781.41,783.87, obviously the lateran
783.9,787.32, but you can now make
787.62,794.97, my apennines and the sometimes all do that and i i remember i was 
795.42,801.12, the writer and cottages heliobas doing an essay my books the oracles profound
801.21,803.49, come right along with me
803.61,805.89, and she saw me like
805.98,811.02, bring in the window like the now with the little tiny bottle over her in a little bottle over there in
811.77,813.15, like
813.15,817.74, and alike in a light and initiatory
817.74,823.26, said he while that your erecting a masterpiece like
823.32,829.2, water and instant there and i like that's nothing to be ashamed of and 
829.2,834.12, so you know i thought that was interesting in ashpit out thou know
834.21,837.84, was like that but i will say and i said this to her as that
838.11,844.8, sometimes these nothing like real rain on a window and now and when it's really ran hard now
844.83,854.1, coming down the side ishakshar or not and sometimes i drive around like with a peavey unsafe condition with that
854.31,862.23, and but it is never know when it's going to happen again so i but then in terms of the people
862.59,870.03, we are like the fiction the fictional aspect of the people has always been present in my work i think that
870.12,872.4, i think i really ever
872.97,876.84, approach somebody to take a picture of them or i know
876.84,879.0, i never see that man is like
879.51,887.52, they are i always see them as a stand in for somebody that might be in my past or like my
887.7,891.99, historian i remember there was one thing i learned what the workshop
892.29,896.55, a long long time ago with a wild from judy dear said this she said
896.61,899.94, we all have our cast of characters
900.12,904.59, those are the people that like that makes us you know walk down the street and
904.65,911.31, to walk into a room and like a photograph that person and that person and that person but those ones don't interest me a bit her in
911.31,914.46, an intuition 
914.64,924.09, in a work working to work and then where the fictional part comes in as when they come in to work with me is the
924.33,928.05, definitely like sometimes in a wolflike
928.26,934.86, very tender pictures on a livery with the gibeonites document or portrait of the person
934.89,946.05, then sometimes what happens as we start to do things whereas wig or were using the planetara with her playing a role and 
946.17,952.65, he might be doing things like careering for the camera in a way that they wouldn't normally act real life and i think that
952.68,955.35, what's interesting about ography is the like
955.41,961.5, i put somebody in front of the camera and that the stage without marable to do
961.56,965.34, you know whatever it is they want to express
965.37,967.11, i find that the
967.8,971.1, i think that i
971.67,975.81, presence versus the absence of human in the pictures
976.41,979.23, that comes in for me as i think that 
979.32,982.89, very much like space that
983.52,988.26, something just happened there or a word about happened now
988.32,991.05, something about that is the sort of like
991.14,994.41, moment away and 
994.41,996.36, and it sort of 
996.72,1005.9, very cinematic heart of work i think one of the things that the name of death my work and i most footsies now
1006.59,1013.49, have been asked by reincarnate used my photographs on the covers outlaw
1013.67,1020.99, issues they were doing up the books of i think we had been adoing seven different 
1021.05,1022.91, cover and 
1024.5,1035.75, that was really something i was very pleased at that because raymond carver somebody that in what i read raymond over like i see is like is kind of like one of these writers were i a dislike
1036.29,1042.53, literally the pictures of my head that i be making and and then also what i really
1044.99,1047.63, related to with his work is that like
1047.69,1052.34, it about reliable life situations and are always so grave
1052.46,1054.32, and i think that 
1054.35,1059.51, something that i at shy about making pictures of well
1059.51,1061.82, i think that i
1062.15,1070.79, our and of working as i so i was really delighted to be you know altenhain alypius of the house at night on
1071.03,1076.1, baboo that as i don't what we talk about when we talk about love
1076.49,1083.36, but i was talking about serious it's kind of pride perpetually
1083.42,1085.37, at
1088.67,1098.3, the thing the idea with an aftermath diary like that i ever heard that before while yet translation think which i like its perfect actually because 
1099.05,1102.5, work as i did that is kind of antisana white
1102.56,1107.36, the book that i was recently published is an excerpt over my nose
1107.45,1109.31, book i
1109.43,1110.72, was
1111.68,1113.63, that i wanted to make
1113.93,1115.64, to make a book
1116.9,1118.07, but
1119.45,1121.58, into that kind of like
1121.97,1125.27, like my picture about where i came from and
1125.33,1126.77, were about
1126.86,1132.41, in some way with the very pictures are one by reflection hing artist bases
1132.71,1137.3, something about them but like i wanted to make pictures of billy focused on that
1137.75,1166.34, this is something that i definitely learned from mary as that like can only talk about yourself so much and now and that when you know i went and when your work is really talking talking about something that beyond you and now it's sort of like your experience of your family you know is something that other people can relate to and that's when your work is working and now sees
1166.4,1170.72, renatus
1171.14,1179.6, i had now made by a state making these pictures i had started organizing them a man when in the time comes to
1179.75,1190.13, certain time comes when you're done shot enough stuff you know that animating in intellect anything putting it selecting the images
1190.13,1207.14, i always thought watanabe's where i was going i knew it was going to be a book because i have was able i felt it i will publish a book unliterary and busy just started making an now had a pile of photographs and i started making a book
1207.17,1211.13, how like doing it that way because i feel like 
1211.16,1214.46, in repose of work or a bone
1215.03,1221.3, start about it is always an up making a book because a book as something that 
1221.75,1224.36, as the perfect form the like
1224.66,1231.23, quantities and because it has a beginning a little now and
1231.56,1239.42, most books which you pick up they make some sense around even if they're not good sophia little bit of precious iridesence
1239.48,1244.67, as with an a book up to kind of force to portendeth
1245.0,1256.07, what's going to be first in now and how my anatomy story so the perfect vehicle for like tigging out whittier's going to be even if you don't even make a book still good to figure out what is one
1256.1,1260.45, i started making that and then as i can of got
1261.02,1266.75, to it i started to realize that in there were all these other things autographic that
1267.44,1270.17, were more than just by
1270.29,1278.15, clar experience in ohio in other kind of more about things that would bear on the fearing that we hear on the radio in
1278.27,1285.32, events that was part of it sent my work and i ended up making
1285.56,1296.93, what the has hundredth photographs in it for me that's a fight rebosos or my books have about twenty five to thirty five pictures of mona
1296.93,1302.81, the four books pickaninnies like that and it's like really got up
1302.93,1308.72, lot of intestine of the other things that i started doing that same time was i had
1312.41,1317.69, multiple cameras that the same exact subject the same time and
1317.81,1323.6, it was not fancy like a tree came orsetti was just like a picture of the first thing with
1323.69,1332.54, and while my one twenty six after i came pitherby little black and white cambric picture and then out
1332.54,1339.32, kind of see what they look like because like a gay when i ran historiographer photographs at what he would always say
1339.32,1342.62, these with the world would like others
1342.86,1350.66, that was something and then i remember there were forget the resistant i am a model and was like why do you speak cameras
1351.02,1356.6, like all make things look in a different different way
1356.72,1365.3, he was a oh you mean i like different races and now and he and i was like that actually the purposes leontion of it because that's what it is it's like
1365.39,1372.38, all painted different picture and sometimes you know the black and white thirty five mile one was perfect though at the
1372.38,1376.01, the peace seven with an 
1376.28,1385.37, sometimes i showed all three of them same retwist to kind of like get out that i titanias not 
1385.76,1389.3, single camera experience now when it was sort of like
1389.3,1393.02, what i think that does that is pointing out
1393.14,1401.66, possible point of view on things now and i think that that interesting thing to think about thinking about photography and truth and
1401.72,1404.24, now one of the things that
1404.3,1407.03, also said that i've always
1407.21,1411.98, is that an artist of artists a lie it tells us the truth
1412.13,1414.59, and i remember
1414.59,1420.11, thinking about that a lot when i was thinking my work because i wanted to
1420.71,1423.05, a story that no
1424.43,1427.1, what i go after making story i don't
1427.1,1442.61, i don't think you know i do but not set out to like tell us alive now i set out to like helen trout something and but sometimes he fiction order they get that now antheil
1442.64,1445.52, that's kind of my approach that how that is
1447.86,1449.81, of book making
1451.82,1453.65, i guess i feel like
1454.4,1458.39, how i know when i'm ready start for making new book as when
1458.69,1464.51, collected together enough photographs i have the like hilaire
1464.54,1467.78, that i have not really
1468.2,1481.31, sort of much which is the deliberate thing now i have a studio where i have waterfall over the place a table out i felt canaille have able
1481.43,1487.85, that way around all the time and i am set something down you know and that is you know
1488.09,1492.32, the testator something else about great
1492.35,1495.62, over that william
1495.74,1500.3, i continue what i had seen and 
1500.48,1507.38, that's something that i had to strike her at paris officers and all make
1507.38,1509.69, ropars
1509.69,1513.44, then i'll have you know or fiesole
1513.62,1522.65, or together and spring together something then upon persecutors
1523.37,1527.9, making a repose to become a book now i think that i
1527.9,1532.34, process of making that is something that i love that part of it that's why i must want to my
1532.34,1536.42, parts than what she had of getting other
1536.69,1539.75, or had it somewhere making sense
1539.78,1545.33, realize that that you realize all the things that have to go photograph
1545.33,1552.86, or the things that you the whole the caressing that you know it might be a simple is like one for interior or
1553.25,1562.46, thou a woman in a doing this in licensure by something or what not
1562.52,1570.14, but if i once you start a sort of abattis that it is actually it's a good face of the work as
1570.98,1584.48, rare that i go out like a picture i had at no one opinion now and ah no i hate that's a nice thing sedateness genoese but yoletta
1585.74,1587.45, i think 
1588.59,1591.44, how i have evolved a refer
1591.59,1599.03, over orienting a graciously bending the salient
1601.31,1605.81, actually the so 
1606.35,1611.45, i think that how i voluntarily how that is that i am
1612.29,1618.05, really one of my strong points is the way that i feel to see whence it is
1618.29,1620.78, yes but just now
1620.84,1623.63, original
1623.81,1627.32, the shouting now i think that i
1627.44,1629.69, richard
1629.84,1637.19, as the website american aeroplanes that now my pictures at dover the head like a hammer
1638.54,1643.64, i think that that's something that i like the

1655.43,1662.57, grab something attention with my features i able to that one i i think in addition to being able to like
1663.02,1670.28, we inexhaustibility that telling you now i think that i
1673.4,1674.9, or
1676.34,1678.41, or like a
1679.28,1682.04, and the tale
1682.37,1696.92, less sexless less of a less less afraid of making really beautiful pictures now i think that if some times when i was not but i like that i will select that go out and make a picture house ii
1697.1,1699.08, preserve
1699.41,1711.23, only documentary it would have made a picture later on that the next day landscape a window that lilylike a painting now and i think that
1711.41,1715.97, let jump back and forth between those things on 
1716.39,1721.97, that's one of the things that as i've grown i am i've got my finger on
1722.18,1725.51, you never things and of just one
1726.05,1727.19, but like
1728.3,1731.87, or westminster contain
1732.98,1735.38, i think about that quietin

1770.03,1775.49, somebody on his feet like that is a gift from god they would do that and 
1775.52,1784.97, but it biermeister as i feel like the one of the things that absent with digital photography a lot of it is that
1785.33,1795.2, bewilderment object i don't know how to print a fixture really incredible on a wall noyelle
1795.23,1799.94, taken weaknesses and rose
1799.94,1812.72, the artiste internet and i think the people that have literally i don't ever present ever and now and that might work for that when that might work but like
1812.84,1814.55, i think that
1814.94,1821.48, well photographer went pitapat out of the camera or the computer or whatever
1821.57,1823.7, to think
