11.82,13.92, i personally don't want one
14.88,20.85, tell me that having a child is great but i'm afraid i'll drop him more damage him in some other way
22.23,24.48, a girl friend is an artist
24.63,29.94, he constructed this fully articulated analogous baby made out of a thousand feet of wire
32.01,35.91, she let me hold it so i could simulate holding a child
36.66,42.3, because it is best of art i feel more compelled to hold the carefully as though it were a child
44.16,69.96, stomach feeling comfortable i went back home to visit my parents and tell them that i didn't want to pass my genetic on to another generation my dad took us to one of our favorite hiking spots
70.14,94.08, so then as you look out over the water lassiter smoke coming in on you the side of the lake here that up until a few years ago after there was some action by the pa was a single large sole source of pollution in north america may be even on the western hemisphere
94.17,111.96, that's called mag court and it extracts magnesium from the lake and big pollution source it seemed as good a place as any to army concerns about bringing a new life into this dangerous and dirty world
112.26,136.11, as people inhabited now you don't really know whether you want to have it or not you say you shaking head now like you don't want to have kittim curious about why you feel like you don't want to have kids is it the responsibility is it you don't want to have a new person on the planet
136.11,142.41, i mean i've been but i was that was really far from my mind
142.59,148.92, dad didn't seem to react strongly as i imagined he seemed almost
148.92,150.21, mused
150.87,153.99, suppose that one of the benefits of life experience
155.85,179.04, for my repute premise of the practical working on it about you know damian pause child and my dear children and my coalblack of design a happening and that's interesting
179.1,186.72, i do hope and so i think there are people who are i don't want to say cut out for this
186.9,188.22, people who are not
188.52,191.97, that there are people who are more inclined to it than others
192.21,193.23, and
193.35,194.55, there's a trap
194.73,196.05, we fall into
197.07,199.83, when we start to follow a given path
199.86,201.93, go into what some spiritual
201.93,204.03, called a barrow desire
204.03,205.08, you
205.92,208.02, have the degree now you have the
208.11,213.78, they have the car saying you get married and then you have the child it's like when next natural consequence
213.96,221.07, the world is completely over populated there's too much suffering theirs too much going on we have to be
221.7,223.2, extremely conscious
223.71,224.61, about
225.9,227.61, someone that this world
229.02,243.57, i had great hopes for a young body that would hike for me to my little boy and when i was happy that your having a child when i was going absolutely i was elastic
243.78,246.9, the horn the whole time
247.5,283.86, but that will i transform one day while i wake to find my desire to have a child is not weighed by the reasons to not have one will the intending to birmingham my attitude
283.86,286.8, or merely reinforced my decision
289.14,296.22, we sometimes hear you afraid about the state of the world are you afraid of a
296.55,299.49, kind of father that you'd like to have
299.76,304.26, children gives hope for the future
304.32,305.28, and
305.49,309.39, think that's why people keep having them is that we think that the
309.75,313.2, thus
313.77,316.11, certainly i should
316.95,327.03, something here sleuthing in the world i do wonder i really i will really curious about your experiences an uncle i really wonder what you'll like
327.84,332.55, you lie about it or what you will lie about it or you'll think about it i i just wonder
332.82,335.19, i hope you'll give me a position
335.19,337.32, every candid about
337.62,343.95, that wearies us alike as a
343.98,345.69, more like a redemption
347.7,349.83, a
352.32,356.34, that we were to say about the demand
357.48,362.37, so interesting that the man prayeth way i wouldn't have necessarily raised that way
362.85,367.62, i haven't heard her put it in those words but certainly
368.91,372.6, really clear and she was always very candid with us even though she didn't
372.72,392.58, a lot of stories about her youth and growing up it was clear that she was writing a wrong somehow by being the best possible mother the chicken okay my family was petition my mother was an alcoholic
392.91,395.76, father was comically unemployed 
396.21,404.07, i was not parented well she always say if i put a lot of time dealing with lot of anxiety in
404.28,466.44, issues and not understanding and finally one time i i read an article about people who grew up in alcoholic families and i analostan ing from that but i always i just wanted to have two children so by the time you know understood this you know i had the standing of my family history and how it affected you as a person i already had the two of you but i realized that by being the best possible parent that i could be to the two of you i redeemed not only my parents for not being but also sort of it was sort of redemption for myself it is like okay said this kind i had a terrible tradesmen next
469.08,473.22, you think in terms of your having
473.22,510.84, children is influenced by the experience of growing up in a household where your parents divorced probably and i wouldn't want to do that to kids why what was he at the pistolesi distorted you know me you know that you feel more like a pan to me now than you did in the teenager but austen well that's often a case i don't tilly feel i had a great experience with my parents when i was a critter
511.38,525.36, i think that there are elements when your parents are struggling and fighting that that's part of your world and that's kind of frightening but you know you have came who is gone through this twice
525.66,534.6, and as you know now made a choice with her husband to have a child and may be too
534.99,543.81, the fact that to give pertinent months as a bantering saying i think he owes again five months
544.26,546.69, to and
547.11,552.45, anemones of belong nine months just to ride a man so you get to a point where
553.11,563.88, you have enjoyed the pregnancy but you sonnet rid of it now that's okay you can go out of the body inestimably you take you with me i am done so i think
564.03,568.59, of timid everything grows and
569.04,571.47, for the right place 
571.86,573.45, in the same way
574.35,576.84, eve
577.17,582.45, i fell right then we are tiresome in annihilating
582.57,588.24, everything has its gestation all the washing is just segestan appeared
589.02,602.34, demolition
602.82,636.24, he
