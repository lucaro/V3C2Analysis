0.42,6.99, i 
10.89,218.7, came in and do the same thing every day all day in the same vessel it would be i think it over time it might feel like a job in that ability to get creative and to play into experiment and be willing to take the responsibility that says this may not turn out good and having appetites what comes out of it you know the lot of times i find the people in this business do things because that's where they've always done it that's because some one else is doing it that way or because that's what he thinks buttoning it was like that in a healthier separate and i think the last couple of years especially i am becoming it as much as it become me if that's not only a noisome an attitude and the fur it's almost like the fardingale version of a desperation which at venatorial actual spanish word but but in our society i mean someone that is an outlaw and almirante beat of their own drum and i think in creating this brand in his name you know i think we tried to embody that idea and also to really embody the the masculine and not a man come sir in the winds and in the labels and the design and everything that goes along with it you know my parents were in the service they weren't gypsies they just like to move and so from the time i was very small we travelled a lot and i have done that as well as an adult but i always had these certain things that were stable my grandmother was one of them i always went to see her no matter where she was a matter where i was she was this kind of stable rock in my life and so perhaps i've always been looking for you know the ability to be free into travel in to be a free spirit and also looking for that stability the same time and i think that you know one thing that perhaps this gives me as well it's like a like a music and you see it like i want to say in cooking not as much in baking but in cooking in music and this just as if you don't understand the science of the things that are happening you cannot you cannot protect us and art perfect example like woodvale gets in so blank from one benares hey you know what i'm going to take some of this instigator take some of it and stick it in sinister among neutral oak patagonia and and i'm going to go occasioned i want to i'm going to battledoria with things with different whitefire with extended fomentations and if it works to sell do it again next year and cut a kind of understanding the science behind those things as able to let us express ourselves artists
219.06,277.35, so these three of vessels that you have here are terracotta and for it and they are a very old and ancient way of making wine in fact i believe it's the first way that wine was made was in terracotta informalities buried in the ground there are so many people that make wine hundreds of thousands of fineries and producers and every one is looking to reinvent a wheel that really can't be reinvented its wine its fermentation is very simple you take fruit he put it aside some sort of vessel the introit for man and then if the winston so there's really inspired to set yourself a part and the thing that i love about these not a lot of people are using them and it provides an opportunity to try something a little bit different this comes from a place where they were making wines and we were on all fours like this is older than us it's bigger than a antill outlive us
277.68,285.42, with amendments or just trying to artistry to grasp a little piece of it hold on for dear life and enjoy the hell out of it
293.7,300.84, it's one part magic i think it's one part is instinct or intuition and i think the rest is just the site
302.43,308.52, you look at the farming you look at the silk at the age of the vines the canopy
308.58,315.0, trunk at the climate you look at all that stuff but i think it's just more of a good feeling
315.24,316.83, i write a thousand
318.12,322.56, so as to feel right you know from the fruit through the fermentation
322.74,329.82, all the way through the life of its barrel and when you blending into bottles to go to guide
332.85,340.53, like in any profession you have people that learn from doing and people that learn from
340.74,352.83, going to school and one isn't any better than the other they just very different approaches wine making and my entire adult life has been in wine then drinking salad
352.83,355.65, to pass a year ago with the intention of
355.68,365.64, production i feel that's a pretty good background it's not the most typical it's not always in most like chemically sadly but you learn that stuff as you go
366.21,370.14, i was lucky enough to be able to live on a vineyard that i bought fruit from and so even
370.47,374.91, that side of tasso and in one of them were
375.12,377.25, graphically interesting
377.37,390.66, and a really beautiful vineyard and learn the kind of really rough and dirty aspects of making wine and a learning all the other sides of this business too you know for accounting to the compliance to
390.66,422.25, the branding and like everything that it took to really make a successful brannan to really get to know the central coast too and all the diversity of all the different areas and you see such a diversity of grapes that are grown here to some many different varieties the people are trying to see what works and what were swollen now is really round heavy for many years as the central cases known for but it's certainly not the only thing here and it's certainly not in my opinion even necessarily the best you know i think they rocketted and borders and
422.28,578.16, so many a man like you can grow anything here is amazing he now i know like the wild will last you know it compensatory a lot and it's true so think if you look at the labels i think that's the most obvious visual you know there's so many things incredible then you have this incredibly masculine side which vesper background the pots that are very industrial or very harsher they don't all go with the makololo this beautiful dress than had the fan that very old and you know taken from a mexican fire back in the eighteen hundreds or whatever and the whole labels very like uninterested i think the brand kind of is like that too for me and that's kind of embodies me as well it that kind of like dark inappropriate joke like opianin people at the dinner party kanofelin which is really fun and natilie he didn't have secondly could and i think that every one loves a little bit of that side and to me one of the things about owning a brand i can do whatever i want i think if you talk to some one that does job after you know two or ten or twenty years as tired of it but in this career it's it's a lifestyle in a people are in line and wine for their lives i think you know you he something that incredibly beautiful or or delicious or thought provoking i don't know that our first thought is i want to read do that or wanted a differently and said oh my god that's amazing i want to try that and so it was never of the effort to do something different or better it was just so i want to do it i try that on demise yet my own answered itself
