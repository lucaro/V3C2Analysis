0.69,12.87, i i'm just fine director and founder of total self counseling and fitness and this is the weapon a talk therapy is not enough how to integrate psychotherapy exercise and nutrition
12.87,17.13, i'm really excited to be talking with you to day about the total self method
19.08,38.16, it's an innovative method of therapy i've created which combined psychotherapy exercise and nutrition and allows practitioners to address multiple aspects of the client's total self simultaneously for many years before creating this method i worked with clients using only the techniques and strategies of traditional cycle therapy
38.22,46.8, in my experience the total self method is far more effective than psychotherapy alone in helping clients create lasting mind body health
47.19,53.13, this weapon or we're going to dig into the total self method and what it means to be a total self practitioner
53.34,54.24, it
54.42,55.68, how does it work
55.71,58.41, more effective and much more
58.65,74.22, hope is that this weapon or will inspire your curiosity and interest to learn more about how to become a total self practitioner to that end i'm currently developing a workshop that will cover today's material and far more death i have your emails and i'll keep you posted
74.28,79.26, can also feel free to check with me for updates okay let's get started
80.25,89.73, so how did i come to this way of working well earlier my career i studied extensively and relied solely on traditional approaches to psychotherapy
89.97,102.93, included in the collected blend of modern psycho analysis cotanto behavioral therapy attachment theory system theory and analysis of transference counter transference resistance and dreams
103.29,110.88, and still do believe that there is much good in the theories and techniques of these traditional approaches and that they are indispensable
110.97,117.15, i want to challenge you to recognize and accept like i did that working this way has certain limitations
119.88,133.68, for example clients were routinely reporting that they needed to modify their diets and lusignan amounts of weight to control dangerous medical conditions like diabetes high blood pressure obesity and high cholesterol
135.15,154.47, i really wanted to help these clients but i was frustrated with the limitations of traditional psychotherapy and with my own lack of appropriate education and training to competently advise them of course i directed such clients back to their doctors and referred them to nutrition is to get the information and guidance i couldn't provide
154.65,164.85, many had already been given this information and guidance or knew it like the back of their hands and still were not able to improve their health or change the relationship to food
166.95,188.85, i wanted to do better for my clients motivated by my frustration with my own limitations and the limitations of traditional psychotherapy i challenge myself to find the solution after months of struggling with this a question popped into my mind that hit me like a ton of bricks what if i could work with their minds and bodies simultaneously
189.96,199.47, i was so excited by the prospect that one practitioner could provide this kind of continuum of care that i set out to add the pieces of the puzzle i would need to do it effectively
199.53,224.58, first i completed a master's degree in nutrition counseling and food studies taking graduate courses like die modification the advanced study of vitamins and minerals and sports nutrition prepared me well to understand the nutritional needs of my clients i also went on for further education and exercise science became a certified personal trainer and immerse myself in the study of how to improve people's health and fitness through exercise
225.78,250.32, the past years i continued to challenge myself to further develop and refine this method in challenging you to think differently to continue to grow professionally and expand the scope of your practice but though in challenging you i'll guide you and give you the tools and strategies to use an innovative method that i found to be more effective than psychotherapy alone and your work with clients
251.73,261.0, the past several years more and more professionals have been contacting me from around the country to learn how i integrate psychotherapy exercise and nutrition
262.05,279.39, their interest support feedback and frustration with the limited opportunities if any at all to formally learn how to integrate these distinct modalities made me realize even more that there's a market for my method of therapy and that a more formal training program is worth building
280.38,292.95, to that end i excited to share with you that i'm actively exploring treating a center where other professionals can get the comprehensive training they want need to competently integrate psychotherapy exercise a nutrition
293.1,295.62, practice is a total self practitioner
296.1,302.97, until then as i said earlier i'm currently developing a workshop that will cover to day's material in far more depth
303.15,307.98, talk more about this and other training opportunities later in the weapon or
309.12,342.18, so here's what we're going to cover to day i'm going to tell you in greater detail about this approach so you have a better understanding of the total self method i'll talk about what it takes for you the practitioner to work this way and by presenting a case i'll show you how this method actually works i'll talk about why the approaches important and why it's more effective to work this way compared to psychotherapy alone a highlight some of the benefits this method will first the both the practitioner and the client and lastly of the custom of the common challenges total self practitioners face
343.92,347.04, okay so what is the total self method
348.15,362.55, it's an innovative method of therapy that integrates three distinct fatalities which are psychotherapy exercise and nutrition and the total self method psychotherapy is the primary agent of change which is why it's at the base of this pyramid
363.42,375.75, working this way offers practitioners and unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously address complex mind body problems and the unparalleled ability to deliver total self improvement
376.74,395.91, exercise a nutrition are both potages of change in their own right however in my experience over the past twenty years developing this method the greatest gains and total self improvement are achieved when exercise a nutrition are woven in when and where appropriate and used to support the psychotherapy work
397.44,416.1, flexible nature of this method is one important aspect that makes it so effective based on the unfolding needs of clients with incision or throughout the course of treatment psychotherapy exercise a nutrition can at any given time be sinlessly integrated in ever varying combinations
417.15,436.95, of course a client could work with a psychotherapist personal trainer and nutrition counsellor but this requires the time energy and motivation to develop three separate professional relationships traveled to three different locations and pay the increased cost of three separate fees all of which can be barriers to treatment
438.42,455.58, it is incumbent on practitioners of all disciplines to strive to remove as best they can the hoops clients must jump through to get the help they need the ability of total self practitioners to provide a seamless integration of psychotherapy exercising nutrition serves this purpose well
456.69,459.87, so what does it take to work this way
461.25,471.33, is true in any field or discipline those who gravitate to it have certain common characteristics and the same is true for total self practitioners for example
471.33,475.62, practitioners have a strong interest in exercise and nutrition
477.33,491.58, when you re integrating three different modalities in this case psychotherapy exercising nutrition the interest motivation and persistence to learn what's necessary to competently in ethically deliver quality care is vitally important
491.85,493.02, don't worry
493.11,517.53, doesn't have to be daunting restore that if you have a passion for learning you'll be excited to broke professionally and expand the way you practise and unlike me you won't need twenty years of trial and error to find your way my goal as i said earlier is to provide you with the consolidated learning experience and give you a guidance tools and strategies you need to be a successful tolse practitioner
519.45,542.76, the total self method were one practitioner provides psychotherapy exercising nutrition is by definition innovative because it is new and changes the established way traditional psychotherapy is practised totallers have to have a certain level of comfort thinking out of the box and adopting an innovative approach that so few if any other practitioners use
544.95,559.02, self practitioners believe that the mind embody are inseparable and that what happens in the body affects the mind and what happens in the mind affects the body and as a result believe the mind and body must be addressed simultaneously
561.06,593.67, and lastly total self practitioners need to understand when and how to blend psychotherapy exercising nutrition as a similar in traditional psychotherapy the efficacy of treatment intervention should be constantly evaluated and carefully chosen on a case by case basis with great respect for each individual's unique needs and concerns such clinical vigilance is particularly crucial for total self practitioners to ensure the clients received the safest and most effective integration of these three distinct modalities
595.65,613.29, illustrate how this method works i'm going to present a case where incorporate several different modalities to facilitate growth and change of course many details have been changed or removed to protect clintonian tality however the learning opportunities remain abundant and uncompromised
614.7,629.01, this case began with a married mother who's presenting problems were out of control bingeing and wait gain as a result as i do with all clients i began with psychotherapy to build report and to understand the psychological underpinnings of her problems
629.1,642.81, after several sessions it was clear that as a result of her husband's chronic pain condition which left him emotionally unavailable she was feeling angry and lonely and was bingeing in an attempt to cope with these painful feelings
644.49,667.2, at this point the wife agreed with my suggestion to invite her husband and for couples sessions to address the relationship conflict and i continue to work with her individually during the couple sessions it became apparent that the husband needed his own individual support so i began psychotherapy with him on an individual basis while continuing the couples therapy and individual therapy with the wife
668.58,676.89, individual work with the husband revealed the toll his chronic pain took on his mind and body he had come to view his body as an enemy
676.89,691.02, he constantly betrayed him and could not be trusted because his confidence in his physical capabilities plummeted along with his self esteem and because he was feeling increasingly more depressed hopeless and worthless
691.98,704.19, i decided to shift the primary focus of our work to exercise knowing i have ample opportunity to do psychotherapy during these training sessions i talk more about how back can be done in a bit
705.15,732.3, positive results were achieved by the simultaneous use of several different modalities including individual psychotherapy for the husband and wife couples therapy and exercise sessions with the husband incorporating psychotherapy initially on the brink of the force the couple reported improved communication and increased optimism about a happy in fulfilling future together so much so that they were new their vows and decided to have a third child
733.41,752.94, the husband empowered by his much improved fitness experienced the dramatic increase in his self esteem and confidence in his physical capabilities this in turn lessen the frequency intensity and duration of his self sabotaging inertial ague which in turn enabled him to better manage his emotional reactions to pain
754.98,775.74, when i first began offering exercise to psychotherapy clients i viewed these two modalities at crucial but distinct and separate however i quickly discovered that the experiential nature of exercise could and as little as on training session bringeth surface issues that clients had been resistant to dealing with for weeks or months and talk therapy
778.08,796.92, this was exciting to me because it was clear that the modality of exercise offered an ideal opportunity to address him poor in emotional issues that may have otherwise been missed at this point there was no turning back i knew i had to find a way to do psychotherapy during exercise sessions
798.15,814.23, experiential as they are exercise sessions require clients to take immediate action in the moment which for those drones and negative irrational non evidence based in a dialogue provokes ample opportunities to verbalize their cognitive distortions
815.85,830.46, my experience the skillful and support of use of the techniques of cognitive therapy to confront these erroneous assumptions is a time efficient and highly effective way to help clients identifying refrain their maladive thinking
832.26,841.59, for example let's take a look at a brief interaction from an exercise session i had with a client who struggled with chronic self sabotaging negative predictions
842.16,857.43, just being informed that he be jumping on a box two inches higher than last time the client hung his head low and sighed deeply when asked about his reaction he said hopelessly i'll never be able to do it to which i responded really how do you know
858.3,865.89, modeling for the client had to question his reflective negative assumptions and encouraging the search for any evidence to support them
866.55,878.04, at that he said he didn't know for sure he couldn't do it and agreed to try shows how effective and efficient a well timed psychotherapeutic intervention can be during an exercise session
880.41,884.76, at this point may be you're a bit skeptical and thinking really
884.76,886.95, that and just one session
887.7,898.86, much can be accomplished in one session here's an example where exercise communication kills time management nutrition and meditation were all addressed
901.47,911.85, in arrived for her exercise session exhausted because she'd been up since two thirty in the morning wearing about the way she laced into an employee of hers the day before
912.12,930.45, right into training we use the first twenty minutes for psychotherapy to address the frequency of her hostile condescending and intimidating communications to her staff though the problems weren't resolved the client said she was ready to exercise because she felt her emotions were more under control after talking
932.07,935.85, the ten minute warm up the client answered a text
935.91,985.62, the client continued to warm up i did psychotherapy the better understand her feelings about this the client said because she so busy every day she no longer has a sense of what's urgent and what can wait so she ends up treating everything as urgent it was clear that to help her feel more in control of her time and schedule she needed a more constructive time management strategy so i quickly taught her about calling which is learning to prioritize tasks by ranking their level of importance on a scale of one to ten one being the least important ten the most this in mind the client smiled and said enthusiastically i think scaling will be helpful because the text i just answered was it most to the client vented a fifteen minute metabolic conditioning work up consisting of three rounds of overhead presses box jumps and set up
987.06,997.62, during the next ten minutes i stretched the client while simultaneously suggesting quick easy and healthy food options she could begin incorporating into her crushing morning schedule
999.15,1008.06, with five minutes remaining the client said she wanted a meditate so i guided her through a mindful breathing exercise while simultaneously continuing the stretching
1008.6,1033.17, afterward the client said she was the most relaxed he'd been in a year so there you have it twenty minutes of psychotherapy ten minutes on time management while warming up fifteen minutes of exercise ten minutes of post work out stretching along with nutritional guidance and five minutes of guided meditation the total self method offers infinite possibilities to meet the unique needs of our clients
1034.73,1051.38, over the past years i've faced many challenges and overcome many obstacles to create the total self method what inspired me most oppressed on where the undeniable benefits to my clients and the rewards i experienced as a practitioner when i work with them this way
1052.82,1071.06, there are many for the purposes of this weapon are i'm going to tell you about the benefit of the continuum of care why working with a total self practitioner is more cost effective and why in my experience the total self method produces improved outcomes when compared to just using traditional psychotherapy
1072.2,1091.91, fundamental benefit for clients in need of psychotherapy exercise in nutrition is the continual of care they receive working with the total self practitioner the total self method allows for single transition between an integration of the three modalities based on each clients unique and evolving needs
1093.26,1107.24, this continual of care also removes a significant barrier to entering treatment which is the stress and confusion that arises from having to look for in develop relationships with multiple professionals who are usually in separate locations
1108.65,1125.75, another benefit calculated by simple math tells us that the single fee of a total self practitioner providing just the right blend of psychotherapy exercise and nutrition will be more cost effective for clients and having to pay the fees of three different providers to piece together similar services
1127.76,1158.75, in my experience clients working with multiple practitioners like a psychotherapist personal trainer and nutrition is have a much harder time staying motivated the change and fall through on treatment recommendations at first this confused me because at least on paper this seemed to be an ideal treatment team however i realized that my colleagues and i were not in fact a team but rather independent practitioners who for the most part did not collaborate and often had conflicting philosophies about what was most helpful to clients
1160.37,1184.7, changes hard even for clients who really want to so we should do our best not to make it harder than it already is total self practitioners are ideally suited to this task because they offer a continuum of care were complex mutineer in problems can be treated simultaneously there able to help clients of widderstone treatment obstacles that arise when working with multiple practitioners
1186.44,1199.22, avoiding these treatment obstacles total self practitioners can better help client maintain their motivation to change and willingness to follow through on treatment recommendations the results of which are improved treatment outcomes
1200.81,1215.99, of course we're concerned about our clients but as altruistic as we may be we still need to feel rewarded by our work and the total self method i've created offers practitioners the opportunity to enjoy a unique set of deeply rewarding benefits
1217.4,1233.6, because total self practitioners are able to combine psychotherapy exercise in nutrition simultaneously there able to work with a broader scope of clients and address a wider range of mind body problems than traditional psychotherapist and other single moderations
1235.04,1246.62, this is rewarding in and of itself that also provides the opportunity for increased income since you have the flexibility to provide services to clients that they would typically seek from other providers
1247.82,1263.9, for practitioners who have a strong interest in exercise and nutrition a passion for learning or comfortable within the nation and believe that the mind and body must be addressed simultaneously it's just more fun using the total self method than psychotherapy alone
1265.43,1289.4, last benefit i mention is that total self practitioners don't sit as much as traditional psychotherapist because exercise sessions with clients get us out of our chairs this is significant because given the mounting research warning that increased in in his length to the increased risk of dangerous medical problems like cancer heart disease and diabetes we have to think of sitting as one of the hazards of the psychotherapy profession
1291.5,1299.84, my journey to create a more effective way to meet the emotional and physical needs of my clients force me far out of my comfort one
1300.95,1308.33, i knew i would be disturbing the status quo of traditional psychotherapy with no ideas about how it could be improved on
1309.53,1318.11, the clients colleagues and supervises as well as family and friends would all have many questions along with some doubts and concerns
1319.61,1345.38, on this journey i faced many unforeseeable challenges and often wished there were others i could turn to that well working this way though i had to go it alone the good news is that you don't have to i'm going to tell you about some of the coming challenges total self practitioners face when using the total self method and in future workshops and seminars i'll go into each of these challenges as well as many others in much greater depth
1346.82,1378.68, one of these common challenges his ethics were the recognized rules of conduct for the practice of psychotherapy of course ethical guidelines are an important means of protecting clients from being exploited emotionally sexually and financially however since clients have unique needs i have found that rigid adherence to such rules of conduct does them at the service that's why total self practitioners must carefully and thoughtfully decide on a case by case basis whether or not their work with clients is ethical
1380.45,1402.95, related to this is the challenge of managing complex therapeutic boundaries especially given the total self practitioners can have dual or multiple relationships with clients and though i am a traditionally train cycle therapist i have found that similar to this rigid adherence to boundaries regardless of each clients unique needs often does more harm than good
1404.6,1417.77, was true for me when i was developing the total self method practitioners who evaluate boundaries case by case often feel uncertain because they missed the clarity that applying one set of boundaries to all client seems to offer
1418.91,1429.95, however experience has taught me that rigid adherence to treatment techniques theories and rules are all too often more comforting to practitioners than they are helpful to clients
1431.3,1452.12, digging deeper into the vast and important topic of therapeutic boundaries is not within the scope of this weapon art however for our purposes to day there are three important points i want you to keep in mind the first is that it's incumbent upon practitioners to evaluate case by case which boundaries are harmful and which boundaries are beneficial
1453.41,1470.03, the second is that to ensure the client sense of safety is preserved and that expanding the therapeutic relationship beyond psychotherapy is in their best interests you must take as many sessions is necessary to thoroughly explore their thoughts feelings and concerns about doing so
1471.47,1479.78, sure that the evaluation of boundaries is on going because what is appropriate to day often changes as the case unfolds
1480.86,1496.4, another common challenge for total self practitioners is filling the problem is that insurance companies don't reimburse for integrated services were clients with a psychiatric diagnosis simultaneously received personal training in nutrition counseling from the same provider
1498.71,1514.25, hopefully as total self practitioners increase in number and lobby to get their services reimbursed such claims will be covered in the not so distant future until then working out mutually agreeable self pay fees with clients is the best option
1515.84,1540.17, office space is another common challenge but much less so than you might think though i have a bigger office now for years i train people in the one show and here which was eleven feet wide and twenty two feet long before that i had an even smaller space and though some new clients have wondered whether they could exercise effectively in such a small space all of them were convinced after their first exercise session
1542.63,1569.9, take a look at this video so you can really get a sense of how much can be done in a small office space here you're looking at the part of the office where i do psychotherapy i quickly moving just a few things around like my therapy chair rolling file cabinet and of course my four legged office made archie i can create all the space i need to provide an effect of exercise session and there's a surprising amount of room for equipment like this large exercise man
1573.95,1577.1, here the lines doing body weight squats
1579.17,1586.19, and here venus as you can see there's plenty of room for both of us to move without restriction
1588.92,1599.24, down the narrow stretch of the l shaped space i able to keep a squat rack tucked up against the wall which leaves plenty of room for barbeques and other barmecides
1604.13,1612.2, in a small office a pullman the doorway with super bands for assistance makes good use of a valuable piece of real estate
1613.07,1622.01, and there is even room to unfold the sage table to stretch your clients part of the session that few if any clients want to miss
1629.18,1665.15, the kind of equipment you choose as a common challenge but not for the reasons you might think because jim's across the country collectively spend millions of dollars to fill sprawling high rents spaces with rows of machines and participant there exists a miss perception among trainers and clients alike that this is what's needed to exercise effectively i assure you that it is not the challenge then for total self practitioners is to accept that this is simply not true and learn how to program effectively without expensive equipment like big bulky exercise machines
1666.44,1707.69, so here's a photo of the space saving equipment i used for several years to create amazing full body workouts appropriately scale to each client physical capabilities it's nice to have some are all of this equipment from the onset because it allows you to keep pace with your clients improving fitness and keep your programming fresh and varied however the reality is that you don't need to invest right away because the unfortunate truth is that many clients will be so condition that fusibility modified body weight exercises and building a base level of arabic fitness will be more than enough for several weeks to several months
1709.1,1738.53, the last and perhaps most important challenge for total self practitioners is that there are few if any educational opportunities to learn how to integrate psychotherapy exercise in nutrition as promised i will guide you and give you the tools and strategies to become a skilled and confident total self practitioner to that end i'm currently developing a comprehensive workshop that will cover today's material in far more depth and i'll be sending you information about the workshop once all the logistics have been worked out
1739.97,1770.24, so should you sign up for the next workshop well if you've always wanted to work this way and are eager to learn now that i've shown you its viable then yes the workshop is for you if you're intrigued with the total self method but orthe beginning of your career and exploring ways of working that are best for you the workshop is also for you are you looking for an effective model of therapy you can use to breathe life into your existing practice and increase your income the workshop is definitely for you to
1771.89,1807.95, as for those of you who are energized and excited about becoming a total self practitioner believed the total self method matches up well with your professional goals and aspirations and want to begin training right away consider applying for an opportunity to train with me directly one on one this is a unique opportunity to receive personalized attention and training individually tailored to your specific learning needs and goals and since we can connect by phone skip or face time this opportunity is also ideal for those who want one on one training with me but are unable to meet in person
