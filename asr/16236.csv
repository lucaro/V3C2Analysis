0.3,12.42, i'm gray marshal from greater post and to day were gone talk about divine he resolved nine and the differences between the serial parallel and later notes as very approaches to color created
12.51,22.71, started out by saying that this is my point of view that there is no right way or wrong way in using any of these approaches this is where you get to make your own choice in your own looks
22.83,35.04, as a quick overview i'd say the cyril noticed the most direct normal way to create a color corcoran one colour creation at a time and then adding on the next colour creation or color instruction on top of that
35.25,42.48, though you want to do two things at once applying to corrections at the same time this is where pelle comes into play
42.69,65.61, you do too more corrections or instructions at once on the other hand layer note combined images not corrections is much more of a composing tool allowing you to combine images in a very specific way sometimes his images have the same mother image same source and sometimes they can be different images such as a grain image
65.61,79.74, skill deeper and i'll show you what i mean by all this the first simplest and most common approach is the serial approach this is what every one uses and will make up at least eighty per cent of the work you do
80.28,82.74, it starts off by taking your first image
83.1,84.72, and
85.47,123.87, a little then go ahead and at another serial and here we'll drop the saturation quite a lot and another serial give it a bit of a pink tint so we see that we go one after another after another missus the way serial works you do one thing than another thing than another thing one of the things here is that order is important we start changing the order like this swapping the tent with the desecration we see that this creates a different image let undo that and get back to where we had it before
124.08,127.41, much more parent in this version
127.8,160.71, so you see the ordered does matter in this approach really every one should be familiar with this sum will try to correct with only one or two notes others with many more almost every color correction includes some serio could churchouse is sure approach ellesmere complicated by looking at the layer note first let's say the climates to do a full be saturation on the overall image but keep the signature read of the motorcycle for that will at a serenade to a full desecration on it
162.06,174.06, to this i'll go to the pull down and adelante fool keep the desecration in the number two note and then number four note will isolate the motorcycle
174.75,184.68, the same tale to all the qualified color to locating the scenes and we now have got the shot with the red marcle on the gray scale background
185.52,203.58, look at the original agency that the color of the bike remains the same what's happened here is that the layer mixer has taken the red bayle the fine by its qualifier visible here for here in the car or by watching our mandecote highlight black and white
204.03,220.14, that's option shift here in the menu is the alpha coming into the out layer mixer in the layer mixers taking whatever is inside the define open placing it over or on top of the background image which is the desecrating
221.07,225.51, let's see what happens when i am more of this to a parallel note
226.23,234.24, while that's unexpected where did our colored marcile go all we have now is the desecrated image what aperture like
234.48,242.73, well my first start out this really confused me to my way of thinking with two input of two images should be mixing in some fashion
242.73,244.29, that's the point i want to make
244.62,301.11, is a variation of the serial approach not of layer i mean but that another way as i said before serial it is a do this than do that than do that parallel is a due this and that at the same time a somewhere inside the parallel not there a secret saucestained the order and priority of the operations when you look at it that way you'll see that the first imputing to saturate the entire image but the other put is simply saying where is using the qualifier then she can see there is no color cristiano saturation nothing casabas ically telling the parallel not to do nothing as far as the parents concerned all of seeing is a toadeater ion and nothing else you define the area to do something but you haven't told it to do anything that
301.59,319.56, is a huge difference from the layer note if you actually want to achieve the red you have to counterbalance or fight the competing desecration i upping the saturation in the qualified area for fifty up to a hundred then we get the combined image and again immaterial
320.28,324.09, this is because it is simultaneously deserting everything
324.21,343.17, per century in the area where the moyle is qualified and by doing that the colour has balanced out has been pulled down to zero by one note up to a hundred by the other so the balance and fifty parallel not has tried to serve two different controls to different tasks at the same time
343.44,353.61, was the man's are different controls lips reset the super saturation back to normal and look at iceland this marsile correction not using
353.64,355.38, highlight
355.5,360.72, instead of saturation let's slightly shift the colour of the bike towards blue
360.96,364.05, giving the game and gain a blue much
364.08,367.8, go back to the result just think about what i've told to do
367.89,377.19, i've told to desecrate everything and in the most liceria shift everything a little blue so what do you think is going to do
378.18,384.9, he made the more cycle low blue not the red plus blue the slightly magenta color we had
384.93,395.19, followed the instructions to shift the bike area towards the blue combining the instructions not the imagery or would happen if i more back to layer mixed
395.55,404.94, i'll get them a gentle bike on top of the background because remember that layer is putting the image on top of the background all parallels taking the instructions
405.15,406.65, this one and
406.71,414.6, internal little blue and instruction from this one where is to turn everything black and white and combining them
414.69,440.58, now i actually have a lot of fun with parallel note it's like playing with water colors to me and a great tool to explore the unexpected let me share you something i did here just willimantic ing about it this is a lot of fun taking the original image took the over a high lights to blue has he qualified to turn everything green into golden and the last one i ever so slightly shifted the low light color
440.76,456.42, the result is fun to me getting a coal all day i find that parallel is fun for just mixing stuff up playing with possibilities it's a blast lay round the bed and i guarantee you'll come up with at least a few looks that you'll want to add to your library
456.63,459.66, moving on let's go back to our original set up her
460.29,462.69, parallel
462.93,479.19, does like care about the order of burnet's the imports around if i had asked for chocolate and vanilla or vanilla and chocolate oxpect to get the same thing expected to taste the same and that is in fact what happens here lets undo that
479.37,480.72, nothing changed
481.2,498.0, now i try that layer mixer and go ahead and reverse those impots now here all he has the saturating what happened here well the full disagreement on top of the red maccleary
498.06,516.24, this is really important point parallel again is closer to serial than it is to layer while they both combine to mistress together they have back to very different things and occasionally he can get them to do the same thing or at least look the same but they're working very different ways
516.54,541.74, parallel to ways and plain color corrections to an image layer exactly what it says it is layering is not combining color instructions but it is taking images and stacking or composing one on top of another let's finish but looking closer at the later note will take it back to our starting set there are three important things to keep in mind when using layer
542.4,545.13, first is the order of this impost
545.34,577.62, you can add then put you can believe them as he found out unlike parallel order is very important and you are making a layer cake you start here with your base layer or background then you add your next layer the red of the bike in this case i can add another layer by kinyon of my later selected and choosing a layer note from the menu in this case it makes it add another layer to our stack let's just add a circle window
577.92,588.6, well you see here is the laying of the area defined by the circle met on top of the other two this one's higher even though second the lower input
588.6,592.14, the stack overriding everything behind it
592.98,597.0, the second important thing is the alpha or mat in each layer
597.69,601.83, this case the all looks like this a circle
602.25,621.96, no three the offers the qualified or keep motorcycle the background of it to be honest with you doesn't matter it has no effect on the composite let's get rid of them that one so now have order alain the final thing i want to talk about
621.96,623.58, positive mode
623.7,635.67, what you get by right licking the layer note see normal adds attracted several we'll go over these initial but each one of these creates a different combining of the later
635.97,674.91, the layer order will determine what goes on top of what the appetite it where or what portion of your image to combine and the mode will tell layer exactly how to combine the images and ways that parallel can't even begin to approach one last point layer allowed you combine images that come from the outside such as though should get by us in their external manetto apply scratches for instance if you tried to do that with parallel well so far all i've been able to do as crasher trying that
674.91,697.08, for hangin there watching and if you think a help i promise the next roubeau and showed the ways that you can use the layer modes and very interesting effects placative my blog gray marshal dotcom slashed blog followeth at graymarsh refold the mimical tinted slash gray marshall
697.35,699.81, or not thanks for taking a time see next time
