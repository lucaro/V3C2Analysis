0.27,12.54, to forethink it was about one half months ago why i was training i notice would be nice to have some more i decided i would look for a dog i could take with me
12.99,23.16, the idea didn't work out of men is really sad and tell what a story
47.76,65.49, marise year old scandinavian hound who was trained participate in racing so due to his training and his experience he was able to take the cicalas like left or right of past and slower
65.97,81.45, angoulaffre he will really get to learn things quickly so getting up and down stairs for something marian to study after you come to grandma
81.78,86.85, so on and on one can really say but my man was he to give his best
87.36,93.09, one and a month after we start training he started to limp
93.48,117.3, first i thought he'd just strange himself but just to be a message side i went to the bed so that looked at him and sadly said but he was beginning to get in a fight and therefore mary wouldn't be able to join me so though i chose to go long distances the worst case in old country
117.81,148.44, the other imitators and really believed that missus haden before i would have been a catastrophe of it as happened otherways really sad to see how maria still enjoys our trip even though he's not going to be able to come with notepaper one can really see how he lies up when it is a bicycle and is really eager to go so
148.71,164.25, for a while i thought oh well perhaps it's going to be okay and i tried again but after a longer tephilim ing returns sir is deftly not going to work
164.25,178.74, with marie definition being able to participate in my journey i look all found a place for him to stay at the college place just out of town on a big farm so despite of a disappointment
178.74,186.3, having to go on behind i now know that he got a great place in star
187.08,215.64, increase of that on really has to take into consideration that it would have been quite a risk to take him especially the first part of the trip treasons going to be quite tricky because due to the fact that time traveling through places where isn't a supermarket for six and comets or so and have to take other food and in order to reach one city
215.64,229.65, self course i took into contentation at it would have to carry with food for my rules well and it's not that bad because i don't have to carry to a back back nevertheless it may sound funny in a way
229.65,247.29, on this i think not having to carry food for mary and just having to focus on the feet for me is going to make a trip it easier and perhaps i even be able to travel a little faster which shouldn't be the worst thing considering
247.35,252.42, traveling through a lasting winter season
252.63,268.5, as we discovered some stationer i feel in turnagain and again with my corn asking how marie getting on so at least no he's getting on our right
268.5,281.13, of course i still have a bad feeling about leaving him but i think knowing that he's found a new home makes his situation bearable
281.85,294.99, i see
298.68,300.39, he
301.59,309.66, i 
311.85,312.96, he
315.99,317.13, he
326.85,327.72, he
