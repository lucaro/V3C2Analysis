1426.17,1429.68, among the most productive habitats in the world
1430.1,1461.33, provide food water and shelter for fish shell fish birds and malls and they serve as a breeding ground of lesser for numerous species many endangered clown and animal species are dependent on watanabe for their survival during migration many birds return to the same sopilotes year after year when they set off on their journey they are fat but they burned this tactful on the flight and can lose nearly half their way
1461.75,1473.72, they returned if they find their old resting place gone or civilities they cannot afford to look for a new or loss of their habitat may spell their death
1473.93,1534.2, therefore each wet land each appertain is a vital link in the chain of redlands along the migratory fly away and therefore crucial to the birds survival weland protection is complex and involved all of us so let us work together to ensure that wetlands these important cradles of life are protected and conserved for the next generations
