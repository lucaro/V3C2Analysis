114.9,123.09, to day he said has to sell is a forum for better understanding and unity to help me the us truly one nation
123.66,141.72, one nation united under us to day so to speak that motor for national unity now graces the editorial page of every edition of the newspaper and indeed national unity is probably the strongest them conveyed in the entire people aidoneus the kind of national unity that most of us want
142.29,144.87, it's the unity of a homogeneous nation
144.93,151.77, a board sameness the one dimensionality of lowest common denominator middle class culture and gossip
151.89,158.22, there's no discrimination here between profundity and trivial indeed to deliberately confused
158.7,160.29, take a look and see
160.62,167.58, it edition of us and to day has four separate sections in the broadest possible appeal
167.94,169.2, news
169.35,171.84, money sports
172.17,173.1, life
173.55,185.31, who could object to that and this new section but is always one there's ignited cover story one and only one i have treated such profound topics as famous mons working
185.34,193.41, a wild legend that the martian simplest lands hand to stop drinking occasioning with a vengeance and nineteen eighty four
193.56,198.9, on the day after the defeat of the marines and lebanon when regan announced the evacuation plan
198.9,203.34, the cover story was headlined even toddles can care about others
203.85,207.96, another regular feature in the front page is use snapshots
208.44,214.68, snap shots attempt to give riders a look and what the people call statistics that shape the nation
215.16,225.87, must we all the while twenty one point a million long distance calls to marromea mothers the andite eighty three only seventeen points million were made on thanksgiving there
226.71,237.06, percent of americans feel that they are not given enough information about nuclear weapons and what more will another six percent also feel that denieth information but no one any more
237.63,246.72, and the juno the well made four percent of the country brought to matters last year only seventy two per cent on brockley you were if you read you as a today
247.62,254.58, more the money section also gives a snapshot snapshots statistics that share our finances
254.76,259.11, percent of barbecue grow by as brought their dolls in department stores
259.17,263.79, the sports section gives us snatch us to deistic the ship sports on
263.88,278.16, callista as at the most madeirans after telling forty forty years old and lactation well you get the message any oh i forgot to tell you how many homes has god got forty nine
278.82,282.09, of these really statistics that shape the nation
282.72,291.0, it needs to know i want to know this statistics any and what is it precisely that these statistics of telling us about the uses to 
291.21,292.98, you know i have a theory
293.4,298.95, i teach the districts to jonathan and i always start the course by telling him to things
299.22,304.62, frost as mark twain once said that a lie damned lies and statistics
304.92,312.03, second i always advise students they should only use statistical manipulations when that absolutely at a loss to know
312.24,314.85, going on in the world that the trying to investigate
315.84,320.91, i glance these supposed words of wisdom wouldn't seem to apply to the use to day
321.33,328.14, how can i be operating down lie or was when as we shall see the growth of the way not to a to anything very strongly at all
328.68,335.64, one would hardly accuse us to die of employing sophisticated statistical manipulations on any of the figures that the gate
336.24,338.85, statistics are straight for results
338.94,343.38, but if we look deeper we can detect something rather interesting
344.13,361.62, point is that by focusing on such trivial as rockland barbecue drills mother's deforms and famous mothers the trying to pinedale picture of the united states as a nation united we all have barbecues and we all brockley all ran
362.04,366.39, and who does not to call her an organized guilty that is mother's dead
366.45,374.61, to the acclaims most of our waking hours and so ye want to buy most people together are uncommon experience feed them trivia
375.21,378.75, i used our lives are more back to us
378.84,381.33, just this a confusion of trivia
383.4,388.29, it is true profusely by the fact that it is printed in the national newspaper
389.43,393.21, likewise the really profound is deliberately trivialized
394.29,397.5, it is stated by the revelation that total
397.89,399.06, even 
399.6,403.89, of course this trivial formula can very quickly become very very boring
404.4,409.8, especially in a country where individualism is right up there alongside nationalism
410.1,414.72, thus the deistical calls therefore had a very two sideralp
414.78,419.1, not only that they give us a profile of the national average
419.13,429.81, they also must give us a sense of individual averages to re assure us of our individuality so that we have something with which we can compare ourselves against others
430.38,440.46, it's reassuring somebody to know that of the favourite fine songs on the charlat week i've had four of them are even like thee of them and actually only one
440.58,444.84, but it's a different one for my friend body who brought reckons my populace
444.93,448.35, but really there's a limit to how much this kind of psychic thrill
448.44,450.57, assure me of my individuality
450.57,452.52, i am not a secure person
453.12,454.98, to day was that
455.31,464.73, the north have to want care to make me an all of you feel like real individuals the same time as the supposed to be a nation elated and trivial pursuits
465.0,472.83, i saw it had on the ingenious idea but why we are a unity the most profound thing that divides us amongst ourselves as
474.03,476.04, it jography
477.87,483.84, to devote entire sent of spread to what they call across the use
484.17,501.39, the idea here quite transiently as to make you feel a true look identity and individuality each of the fifty states and is given fetiches of a column for what were presumably the most important news events of the intestate that day
501.69,506.91, a random and quite unscientific sample from yesterday revealed the following james
507.06,508.41, from a
508.89,515.79, safely stores will be allowed to sell twenty five thousand gallons of california milk in that state starting july fast
515.91,518.13, from massachusetts
518.28,527.01, as was expected to sing the billies et naming an express we overpass not even the whole express after a begins
527.43,529.35, and from maryland
529.44,533.55, gypsy moth spring was due to begin in north bethesda yesterday
533.94,538.77, women children the elderly and now with ologies were advised caution
539.49,542.01, you can't get much more individual and that
542.34,544.83, it takes seventeen jungles and editors
544.83,547.17, just that feature together every day
547.38,550.83, but just in case you want to try and get a little bit more individual
550.89,554.01, just in case you one of these people who are made
554.28,561.0, secure by being told howsever one else's then you see to dear of course has a column for you
561.24,570.93, it's of use which of course appears alongside you across us for example and i caught disintensify
571.05,582.63, petronille installed in a student smoking lounge and a palatine illinois high school about forty students who had rather trueba than smoke it requested the cuspidors
582.69,586.95, strongly with randal and school district permission to smoke and to
587.67,597.42, well it it was by day for individuality in the use to be a eindrid ality is even more trivial than issue the national unity and sadness
597.84,599.82, remember he began this
600.0,603.45, statistics are usually tell my students
603.63,611.46, well i'm convinced that if the editors and publishers of this newspaper are not at a complete loss in all what's happening in the use to day
611.46,613.53, and the selling of telling it to us
613.74,623.73, i don't blame the jungle i spy the way because this is a very definitely an editor's newspaper the journalists are given a very short path to walk and held on tight leading strings all away
624.39,637.41, as for lies down lies the fistics it's clear that the barrio useless statistics as a cover for something what are they really trying to convey with these statistics and i think the underlies an evasion of geography
638.25,652.83, they have such a fetish or a geographical differentiation enemy jervis in fact every ovenden ideological to differences between people can be hidden a special questions we can be convinced the special differences of what are really important
653.04,671.1, you and i are supposed to be down to national boundaries and except that the regans and rockefeller have more in common with us that we do with the ordinary working people of japan or russia island easover persianism more in common with the rockefeller an the money that is not the politics
671.1,684.27, the sadly that's not the reality we can my shoes nation was in disguise is the real difference between people which are political and social and economic not special differences in giving just one quick illustration
684.54,711.72, i drink in a great war considers and i could find you parsonages where i come from in scotland that are just like it i'm thinking particularly of the unicorn bar on old darkey's road the people of there are canadien for people in cities but the atmosphere is just the same steamah more in common with the unicorn which is fittest miles away than it does with the dentrifice sounding tichbourne corner the akodama the
712.29,726.99, to something i didn't know either of bed generate penance for chili was a geographer and his mandate all chillen school children to lamora because it enhances his a sense of national pride and nationalism
727.29,739.98, don't get me wrong in not that i disliked jography i think if we knew more jography we would actually be convinced of an international perspective and not a nationalism and it was every other kind of regionalism
740.34,743.52, just like to finish this little bit by seeing
743.52,745.98, so much for the geographical study of types
745.98,758.58, the nationalism and regional is which is inhabitant in the gait cooperation and the usage teeswater the really an ideology the taunting us from what the real social differences are between us and where the social similarities are
771.12,821.76, one company ranks among the largest five hundred corporations america in nineteen eighty three it operating revenues were over one billion dollars it's natica ninety two million dollars on that has more than twenty seven thousand employees
823.08,852.09, its board of directors includes the former chairman of eastman kodak the former president of the associated press and former first lady raglan carter intensity five daily newspapers thirty five non daily newspapers
852.36,886.59, it stations six am radio stations seven at stations and the research firm of lewis harris and associates and us a to day 
893.58,898.08, i haven't inexactly who is that rested
898.23,903.09, or perhaps more intriguing why they read it a hiawatha get out of it
903.21,905.46, a little deeper and i find out
905.79,908.4, this is the confusion
908.43,912.54, geographical trivial in the cross the sea spread
912.57,918.06, we can all see this it's a crazy quilt of everything and nothing from everywhere and nowhere
918.18,923.37, u s a to day claims that is a very easy newspaper to read
923.55,944.01, by and relaxed but for myself i find this kind of newsprint sense utterly impossible to get into it might be instant in what's happening in the place where i live or where i lived a eaten spent a lot of time but it's not really the militarist abides over passes out to backaching the amount to catch up on
944.28,946.23, i don't know about you
946.53,947.85, this page
947.88,950.52, makes me now is
951.45,954.66, the point it really isn't meant to be read
955.11,959.46, what a stupid concept in a television each to read a newspaper
959.46,964.08, look at this weather pitch
964.53,973.08, once it's up the right whereon it's not meant to be read
973.44,979.29, the exception of the place you're in maybe the place you're going to this day is not meant to give you any information
979.53,998.31, he said o whether peace is meant to soothe and mesmerise you like a mild psychedelic drug i meant to give you the whole warm egg of the use at once with the speckles mark on as the place as you may have been if you're silly enough to cynically read the page then you'll lose the effect entirely
999.15,1023.39, you see to day is genetic use this formula use his television generalism the management provides a writing gate for the generalist and titled working for us a today in which this dress will rove again the journalist should emphasize what is new and what is coming not as dotterine the news emphasize what's new and what is coming
1024.89,1038.0, patton for several grafts the advice that's partagas presumably grass is new and coming for paragraphs and they find it necessary to tell a journalist to squeeze a fact into every line
1038.24,1043.25, a relevant it might be the cadunt i only one idea for sentence
1043.52,1055.4, in fact the items and sate they are so short sometimes only three or four paragraphs that he would better be destroyed as snippets not stories journalists themselves have ridiculed it as jungfrau realism
1055.52,1059.24, calling it make paper siwash minuet of news
1059.27,1066.92, someone more cruel still suggested that it may surprise us all some tea and when the prize for the best investigative paragraph
1067.82,1073.07, you can see why and generalism soles as is the only danger field of fashion
1073.22,1074.9, don't get no respect
1075.2,1081.92, but this last coming not common denominate of journalism the churning out of your basic fluff
1082.52,1085.76, a quite deliberate policy on the part of the said to
1088.49,1097.19, to day is nothing but terrible flush which is bonnach day then agitated back into place by midnight for satellite transmission
1098.0,1111.89, the style could be capitalized as right wing more than it in the editorial opinions and stage debates that take place with them used generally manages to take up both sides of inherently conservative issues
1111.92,1117.11, and only comes down firmly on one side when the issue is utterly unexceptionable
1117.17,1121.49, for example they asked should the olympics be political
1121.82,1125.78, you won't be surprised to land that the answer was a resounding nor
1126.38,1141.62, which is all very well had anyone will disagree with them i'm sure but it misses the point some one what what do they really mean the contents soviet union for pulling at the time and they condemn the use which they call we
1142.22,1144.47, cottages for years ago
1144.5,1148.19, we have bitten it was jimmy carter
1148.22,1154.85, a majority of americans felt us athletes should have participated in the olympics and american athletes certainly felt that
1155.54,1157.94, a question of course as he rules
1158.03,1166.64, and how the law and in whose interest i ran but as to my substance in these questions the thought with the flush of seated
1167.15,1177.38, even when they try to inject substance at a half hearted effort recent front page headlines read rigganites passing ethics dread
1177.44,1188.15, well it seems to have a little meat to it at least until you start to read the sniff it and you find sixty four per cent people interviewed fought the trigamist ration was and a court
1188.21,1190.67, the washington of corruption
1190.79,1204.8, administrations in the last twenty years well that's not much of a record not really saying much quite little giving the last twenty years of broad as water gate in the badlands of fear which had exasperate fear to name a few
1207.11,1214.85, also the recent report and said that some market reset farm expects a number of well of families to double by 
1215.15,1217.79, of one more than 
1218.03,1228.41, as the district of dubious to say the least but even even that is not the point you see to day is giving us the impression that the nation
1228.41,1242.54, this is getting richer while in fact the number and percentage of people only official property line has increased continually through the ninetyeight again best would be given only one side of very little substance
1243.35,1251.75, intentional that you see to day's policy it is for ganeshram allan near calls the journalism of hope
1254.54,1258.41, the contrite generalism of despair let me court
1259.01,1273.65, the general is of despair is a district of technique of usually leaving readers discouraged on mine or indignant with its politics of hoppers seated seeking to cover all the news without anguish without despair
1274.37,1275.9, good as well as the bond
1276.23,1287.96, and he continues want to do so with editorial voices that emphasize clean ideas for a good life or a better one and the getting understanding and unity rather than disdain and divisiveness
1287.96,1290.81, and here we have the use vision in a nutshell
1291.02,1315.11, so much for general istic objectivity gan its news must be sanitized to hope filter norman that there is much in the world it is deficient should make us mad more forcefully than any other national newspaper use to dis telling us to ignore it ignore polity they nor unemployment ignore the realities of racism and oppression ignored the us invasion of central america and so force
1315.89,1319.19, the case afore doesn't work
1319.7,1326.45, i can believe the peculation figures they were selling one and a half million copies eighteen months after this started up
1327.11,1334.07, i am agitate you who reads you see to do well i'll tell you who you asserted says is reading them
1334.19,1345.8, they claimed the readers are an up beaucaire and active audience there words it's an audience of travelers and cordage in the paper home as well as in the waterwork and on the road
1345.8,1356.75, forty four per cent of us to deeds they are no beatific windows more statistics for the one percent of the riders have professional managerial jobs
1356.75,1359.57, to a national average of aperient
1360.26,1366.89, the point in percent of the riders on forelocks and sarasate cetera what is all this side up to
1367.31,1369.11, you may well ask
1369.26,1370.55, have another try
1370.67,1384.98, this profile of audience adds up to another blind stereotype quite deserving of us to day i am convinced that they are convinced that their readership is predominantly the young trended gent rifling auguration the famed happy
1385.46,1391.22, the hall mark of the steady take up is as a during business hours there totally amused in the real world
1391.22,1394.16, but all of time i see tosca from it
1394.43,1400.76, and you say to day understand this it is in the paper as for they call a second mine
1401.06,1410.06, you have joined the altitude excuse me journal the new york times are ought not to stay abreast of whatever it is that he or she is trying to see a breast of
1410.42,1418.22, but at all other times they hed trivia as a cure for reality you seated is in fact the asylum against reality
1418.34,1432.68, he makes a actualities it is an manichaeans the world it soothes you feel good it is the mill cooking station of the newspaper world bland that bright fancy relaxation
1432.8,1437.51, i was also is you said is not the journalism of hope
1438.11,1442.04, it is used to day that represents a real journalism of despair
1442.07,1445.82, it starts in the assumption that reality is so desperate
1446.57,1455.18, so depressing that we can't handle it and the rather than changing the ronald or we can hope to do is to filter it through a powerful siren
1455.39,1469.49, i don't believe the one was a desperate and i am not pessimistic i'm not a tall without hoping optimism but i am optimistic about changing the world not denying it i believe walking people organized can and will change the world
1469.97,1483.53, but a telling finally to the question of furies to day my guess is that the vision of the oppidans conjured up by the gallic cooperation is itself a product of their hope filter i still haven't seen anyone reading the paper
1483.77,1486.44, all right this is the generalism of hope
1486.59,1493.55, i will not rend with a piece of serious advice to the publishers of use to do if you really want to sell the product
1493.91,1501.32, if you're serious about the up beat upscale appearance that you have to get into the butyric they live
1502.22,1512.57, to change the name of the paper you said to day is far too blind and stuffy not really very up better i have a suggestion for you fluff and stuff us
1515.18,1641.69, antoinette incanestrato totalitarian state assassination
