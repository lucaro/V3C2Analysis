0.03,23.88, hello and welcome to any sports reporters malicious this week's panes dragonflies and arthur down to day's first topic as wayne kept in was fired at an airport
23.91,40.77, that law of us or danaans pretty low of these i mean to fire some one partial off a bus with a team is kind of tough to say that that's a fair firing filling companion he has done a lot of arguably questionable things at us is not the success that every thought was going to have
40.83,53.19, the decision to fire him didn't come after the game and didn't come on the bus and tooth flight on the way home it came made game they were they were having meetings in at half time in the third quarter of that game to decide to fire that's pretty low
53.25,71.64, it was self unable to i mean it was just a matter of time when it was going to happen you know they brought him in case he had a really good years down at tennessee but he could not get the job done you a sense one of those top school you think of earned you want to see them in the national championship at the school that's where they put themselves and he was not going to get that job done
71.73,91.38, to me is just an idiot everywhere he's gone is run as mouth i mean merrikan house should get fired on the feeling but to be fired i mean in the way that he was fired that decided the third corner and luxury boxers and the dean
91.98,137.64, fire dorter i mean there was they were going they were down a lot there were the game you know and losing pretty bad and there's no there's no fire there and the wind of the day was on sports and i heard an earlier today or yesterday came umberto if wenamon ran his offence like he ran as mouth he'd be successful and that is so true because ashpot good coach now i mean it all you can ever youngsters of his reputation or sets father i mean let's be honest what real job what is you know been offered that he actually deserved and it was a horrible and allan averageness and how horrible usefully out of a job he tried congener top coaching job in the fayther so he's worked deserves sat a coordinator position of besworth he was offered a plane ticket home
137.94,142.98, his fire and so he did deserve that i mean i believe it should be came last year when you 
143.01,145.11, presumer one
145.23,170.49, and they fell to with six losses you know he could not get the job done there was a lot of talent in case well you know you have widespread he's always had the talent there both often silly in defensively and connate job done what's the excuse and i think it should came last year and right to the end he was complaining about the scholarship obviously they lost their scholarships because prospects another funny thing we'll get to later but you know
170.7,173.73, getting punished with things that didn't do any different i mean
174.3,278.04, i love to say i'm sad for the guy that is not a job but i mean care he's teetotal a kind of punch in the face i got that arrogant attestedly exactly and it's more than justified giving guy job they really doesn't deserve the uses a pretty high profile a job in a pretty pertinent to get butlership in the hands of the gulielmensian proved themselves to be a winning coach for numerous years it's ben you know i'm pretty good i do a pretty good job of recruiting but once i get the kids i can't develop the unalienable amusement you see warm from the gecko because of all the pressure that you have on you as a coach because of the history and the tradition that is focused on the schools and he could not get the job done with the pressure therefore in the spotlight you know joe returned a great job for years open state contesting a good coach all of a sudden he was out of the spot light you know even when his team was down it was always well he's the legend joe paterno it's hard not to you know keep him around obliterator but i don't see him benthead coaching about helwyse and go from notre dame to the canaanites
278.19,280.62, was it the perfect set off in new york
280.71,309.09, i think the greatest lointaines perfect i have never seen that man frown a dam my wife and for the fact that he had two teammates star gernando come up and walk him off the field and he embraces and pet and to start all in his eyes out i've never seen the man like that and the sendoff get his number retired by the near canines not forget the cenoby all the major league teams in the season when it
309.21,354.39, from our owner berewold deserved yet and you goes up on a real high note yet a great finishing job catching you know jeered at coming up to take him off the field his stars for finished phenomenon you can talk about it numbers all day long he could literally talk about it mariniere or on the without but it was the perfect end of his should finish on the mount because that's where he made his name he wasn't in no known for the athlete even though i was the best pitching fielding picture in my opinion the major leagues ever seen but i really do think that as a perfect senonian those two guys come out there and take him off the really class act by god and are immanent you know you look at what marinated hard not to respect the man i mean a threat and he definitely it he's got to be the most respected the man of baseball
354.42,359.82, what he did you know the shore careers is a class act and it's hard not to root for a day
359.91,364.41, that and you know he's just goes to show the yankees
365.49,370.14, like the end of an era feels like an obsolete what i saw darter
370.2,378.87, there and he can't play because he's on the deal is ended there and he's got to be claremont
378.99,386.22, in all the posies and winds between those three is not incredible and to see that moment with those three on the mound
386.31,389.22, was pretty cool to see and you know i grew up
389.37,391.14, despising
391.2,396.18, you know this but you know now i wanted to respect them and you know it's just
396.81,420.39, for a week and the whole road know now you look back at it i'm there watching that the game with me totontenac about ben i mean i mean the three teammates there have hackamore in the post season alone i mean mary on every two saves any pet it's got a post season record nineteen winds and their jeers got record two hundred hits
420.45,428.04, it's just it's one season for these guys ready you know so for them to have that in their entire possesion career the teats are
428.79,469.11, arguably the three best team mates that i can think of i mean his impact for re outside of just the antouhonoran show on sunday morning and it's one of those things were his respect goes far beyond the gate key stadium of baronetcies topertoe going to see our lifetime and ever tomlinson to come along and pass in just for numbers and impact alone the man finished with a career whip of one that it's unheard of in bigorre going to talk numbers that is unheard of unto more people walking on the moon then runs that he looted
469.17,476.52, i sent off the entire year which is a true tribute to a man of dioramas i think the only thing i could have made it even a little bit better
476.88,480.42, beside it or one day contract and when i catch
480.51,486.81, said remaining as a man a solemn
486.87,498.69, all out there on the mound a alleys out because they know it's alimentation for jerome of the top prospects on the anchor animation at them to be able to witness that
498.78,510.09, just be in awe i mean it's almost like a passing on the torch yet i think absolutely all sealmen vartoo up for what we know him for he went beyond and saw what the game of baseball was what made a great
511.86,515.55, we'll be right back at their equipment break
519.54,538.83, teetotalers

687.42,710.61, to their own demise i mean let's be honest commerce not the answer to agricole out you know despite what brian kelly thinks of what time of these can be with the cat has no confidence in himself so how is it his osawotamie a quarterback of one of the highest profile comfortable teams in the nation on top that your expectations were so cut so high coming off that championship in the underpass up until they played alabama and then
710.64,745.68, an independent they always felt borderside there was at the toughest schedule in the national financial for polynesian ear at inishmaan perform that entire time and i just heard and if you don't have the guys to fill in the rolls of manti to tyler for and all those guys is hard to just rebuild your team unless the recruiting is there a man i mean the strict economies for itself and you know when you play teams like oklahoma use michigan you play the merrier out these exactly a cake walk when you go into their deposit satins even if they're coming to you am
745.83,767.19, is it bad for instead of i don't think so i think this is just not their ear this is the year where you know and i would george's making a name from the secesher playing some top teams including clumsiest carolina they just beaver good aleutian it's just not there as here is no names here this year it's not and i mean i live through all the
767.19,777.75, and down years of tilghman charlie weitzel now brian kelly and now i feel like it's the up and down near surrender got one year than their bad another year here always going to have the note and faithful
777.78,790.2, i that people are going to watch or gardens you know not dame there you know there watch country willemott and the only contributions on so you know people are going to watch so was bad for health all onnecessary
790.2,803.01, a bad for not a name yeah absolutely easily farseeing just looking at who they've got latrina state at three and one temerity good rang twenty second the nation but again you know they're not
803.1,821.25, exactly lois than texas to native like positive filamentary down you see who doesn't even have a head coach nor force they should be therefore may be always gives him a tough game for some reason but they should be named you know they're not very good either
821.28,827.97, beatissima stafford there the top
828.15,839.1, he is but if when it comes out of oregon versus stanford later in the season that's going to be for national championship heads a man ah
839.22,882.21, back under the rocky linderbeck another rock while the roothing they could go into without ethothion to at least one inch would give them you know a shout of a decent ballgames you know all another bastion to want none and some sort of high profile burganet they have shown a mess bowls thinking back on the top i had remained it's just one of those things were the best to get at them in but will they be in it some that's up to their own you know i etherealising the ethereally good defensively they run the ball the rataplan
882.33,884.52, i mean i club
884.85,900.12, if what i understate biggest challenge will be organisation this for it is the one game tientsin
900.21,920.1, i think we saw last night how exciting as you look at a team like pits but the story lines were there last night inspiration that has made the you know the post season since you know even you know i was one year old and i was just being both
920.1,927.72, pittsburgh amity that is in devastation right now because the stealers are awful and i know palaestina so that give them some hope
927.75,1000.32, that the city of pittsburgh needed that and you look at the stadium regardless of whether those fans were there in april it's still a good moment for the city of pittsburg and even the plain game before them the one game play off to get into the play off to play that one game play off was in saint texas and tampa just to make the last while carson had a remnant of the bucke den and boss the yankees bloodshed bisonette playfully game sonata one game play off the play the one game play off to get into the play of his all how does it buckatowndown back to last year ireson his retirement tore his team at a play that one game play off and they ultimately lost and i could see what people say it's on fair but at the same time it's just so exciting tonietta wasn't imparting crown but i felt like i was because forty thousand people just screaming i television i'm turning it down like hochstein it's so exciting and good for the city of pittsburg honestly to great things that happened last night's game larionoff start and he got see him back and then rosemary you know with the two solar shadow after the game i think he summed it up perfectly
1000.62,1007.34, the box if you don't want a world series you're looked at as a disappointment now he goes to pittsburgh it's too roasting 
1007.34,1015.56, a hero there said it wasn't fun in the bronx and you know that's a you need to have that mentality of a champion to be a play in new york city
1015.56,1088.88, man doesn't have that but there to see rosemary you know say that after the game was just a kind of put everything into perspective of just how much worn play off when can mean to the city of indienne for these plaything about it think about all men the pittsburg has right now going to the vision series but they also might lose one that top pictures you know it's always a situation where if you are a trowsis play off game what's going to happen for the division series are not you now put behind the atalanta through as much as the faces of another telekinesis going to throw for detroit you know will he get to pechorin whereas the actor you know pittsburg or the attentaeter else wins that plain game at owes going to have with them but thinking a little men on they have thing about how that gives them a chance really to cut a booster energy and the fans and the players really to aviation series of an arguable a series that they should mentioned world sercham inship is nineteen forty eight they know at cleveland is another city that houseless there just a straw headmistress ing cities pittsburgh cleveland artaxata sostenuto of these teams at the time they raise and the cleveland indians neither than have a rainscourt eight teaette close student at the gut to a ring
1089.0,1149.51, should be very interesting because if pittsburg were to get a win in saint louis the cornal's better watch out because of that that fascion is going to be a big aspect as to why the petraria to the national championship series i think to franconnette indians and i think he can really solidified his position as a great manager and you know that that one year in boston is a inhalations team there more like that old fourteen guys that are necessarily you know that the number one at their position at a team filomel ers and cavalrymen a mark beloochistan all fourteen which i think is that is the reason punchinelletto rathantara to her the same way she
1151.82,1171.11, etiennette
1174.38,1211.76, he dreams and good grades are enough to get into college there are actual steps you need to take finding someone who can help is the first and most important for the next step goodwood
1211.91,1271.82, he eenamost tell you the way to many but what if you had just one too many but driving his trump driving the magical thing about using energy wisely if the anyone can do it as energy saving light bulbs energy smart power strepsiceros computers and games systems when not in use getter and make a difference learned an energy that gomashta
1272.57,1309.05, bobinette amesfort reporters having number five in tire woods was named pete to player of the year is the one continued to get better or is this is wolverstone pears ago by stopping he has a chance to win a man like bill still he is a crescent more torment or five tormenter is pretty good for a guy whose age and has been rather walk so many times you know to earning a point five million dollars is still pretty good in my opinion lest some ice no major wins though that's that's still isotope that
1309.05,1316.4, her woods and you know it the one is not one major is how golfers make their living you know the most majors going to be the top guys
1316.4,1317.84, he tore
1317.84,1336.47, you know he was still rough he was still there through most of it finished at for fourth the master's etheric is the biggest one but five boys throughout the year when people the year i still think he's got a chance to once more here's what i think is different about tiger woods now as opposed to tiger was in the past you mentioned that fourth place masters at the master's
1336.62,1343.4, tiger woods of you know i think he went that torment and i think you know what we see
1343.49,1345.71, tiger woods who in
1346.07,1349.7, tom now on his way back up will he reach the peak
1349.7,1353.03, i was at i don't know but i think he's going to continue to get better
1353.06,1358.88, as you know he may be a couple more years go on before he starts to decline an let's be honest he's not tom it
1358.91,1378.5, he's not going to get there and then all of a sudden it would be playing the champions for it's like it's like a whole fame writing a bus and miasmal rensburg being the only exception it's just not going to happen i think tiger woods is tied and he's going to get back to that you know dominate the dominant part of his career i think
1379.49,1396.17, to have to want a major to to get the imitatio repelled him up there well i mean and you don't know mustachios this year i mean to break down gahalantine this ornament if you watch any of what tiger was his plan he would be in the top ten through
1396.17,1490.19, friday saturday he played poorly dropped out of a sunday was his worst day it seemed like an a lot of historical the major he was in contention for the master who was in contention for a lot of these other major torments the us operation for a while and all sudden he just fell off the face of the earth on the weekend and that's what he means the change he would ishanashte too in on sundays watchwords and they did for an inflamer one was happy in me like a tiger as a chancelier he did who cares rigolette's nowhither as a model citizen i mean that that's one thing the fires me up a little bit as if you're going to like some one as a golfer how are you supposed to know them as a person redeless year there and you know the guy personally who cares you like him as a gulf his job is to win majors went torments and make people happy that you keep misbehavior i mean that that's what he adooma of entertaining again an nobody's goin to watch dolorous like it with babbacombe's golf riding several one tiger wood place station a sunday when he hears that picture read that's what it's all about for him now it roared but that's the problem he hasn't played well on week end so he's not there on saturdays and sundays and that's why people are starting to think that he's at the end of his career because he just that being able to hold it off for four days he's only there for the first to the moment time per player the year winter and now
1490.46,1525.53, you get frustrated on sundays i hear you on a tiger woods because you missus a putter anything of the sort but does that price is never missed a politer mister park to noobody think that he has a couple more chisenhall knew i really still think he's got palestinian animal he still fitness fine so the bottom line is his body realestate rioting is whether his knees can hold up his head majorities in the past it's whether his joints of a really going to be able akeepin in the matches manias topic what is the most emotional sports moment all time
1525.86,1530.03, and there are so many mitigates day nineteen ninety six
1530.12,1534.95, i had the man's father was murdered earlier in the season my baton goes out demi
1534.95,1569.93, and when the statemanship stared argued the guys on the floor crying hugging the ball in the locker after his team was the final game and there out there celebrated his their breakdown all the newcomers care about mogador even showing his team mate celebrate what was such an emotional day he was so close to his father goes out winstanley for him on father's day and enumerated down dear and i mean it's hard to argue against a bit the sentiments definitely more emotional things happened in sports and one in the jumped off me why ponamalee road after baseball resumed after two thousand one attacks
1570.26,1595.46, a good one and a rotation pampas beloved in new york city and for him to come out tie that game up in the ninth inning in chastising an about that to the star for me at sir you know i love to say he godfathers day game but also five years old i really don't remember that but
1595.55,1612.08, you know being a red sixieme that and especially remember that tattherin bonnily knows better and the fighting is arbuthnot players before you went to new york i like him in cincinnati for whatever is 
1612.14,1713.09, he goes to new york at the horny know i don't go to school for a week a year later the red socks win the world series with a team of misfits and after the game it's just that sense of relief it's likely in it now eighty six years it was awesome to watch as you know as a fan there was a logician had that great first inning of a game said i knew that i knew the series of over that point going back to the hole you know toenne thing i mean what happened and no after when the as were then in the world series that year all those molesworth bush came out to the world the first pale the first name the world serious emotional but the way ended the end of what the ending weigel crying on the floor made of terra breaking down on the mound alyosha game shinto because i remember reading something about teetotalling president bush do not let this ball bounce no matter what you do that ball does not hit the ground and i seemed that new homesteads will be you in new york he had there was that he special all about that that serious writer on eleven and they told george was that he had to wear ballistite and he took it off because he said he couldn't throw without it so i mean showing a lot of courage and i know is really a son and that he was out there in support of being a whole thing why the elector not i mean it was still emotional moment for new york city and pretty much the united states in general then you go back to two thousand one general that feeling of patriotism in the united states which is awkward it's funny that we're talking about now because the government shut down in embrace there you know the feeling of its every one kind of coming together every remember going to the ball in a couple of days after leavetaking
1713.18,1715.13, you know it was just
1715.22,1718.94, felicia every one was together and i think sports
1719.0,1730.07, sports have a weird way of bringing people together and you know roared like that on top of it and it's just i think that's the reason why you need sports a kind of bring you away a little bit from the real life
1730.07,1765.89, real world when you need to and i mean that happened in boston as well this year with and his choice as that fired up the nation and you know it's it's cool to see how sports can can bring so many people together and then you use throw again a tragedy on top of it and set it funston till together but it also tactile pardoned another stabbing in la atonement like that matheson of those things that can go either way but i mean when it does bring people up at dobriner's pretty hostile to see ye and i in another emotional one to that speaking a woman after breakwater passed away he had that great man again
1765.95,1777.59, for this week past of an spotters door and any price in arthur and myself eliciting for turning into this week's episode of misfortunes
