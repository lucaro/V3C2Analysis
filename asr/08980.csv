19.41,23.58, i'd like to bring valencia and here into this discussion
23.67,42.66, as executive director of sorry i have a speaking into the wrong as executive director of the community design center of a planter you you are also going to be the beneficiary and the participant of all this public discussion that congo
42.78,49.02, labour what's going on here for your community come on come on stand up and the
51.42,61.8, monasteries one community or two communities and never has inclusion
61.89,63.51, and to 
63.9,66.24, always talk about me income
66.42,70.65, relatively is the password forgettin
73.5,77.34, common toilin to me tunicates great
78.42,82.29, notice that the bell by
82.41,92.34, a great but there is no policy protection in place for a nester boreales in going up it they lived in a tenuity for forty years
92.4,97.23, prithee or just the term outline
97.35,100.98, as ottomans
101.04,107.52, anthony who was not necessarily a part of inclusion in a land
107.94,116.64, we talk about people moving back in that happening neighborhood turnover but what happens to the people who were there to hold
116.97,120.51, we provide the same as of having
120.51,124.23, soon to be an architect or an
124.29,129.15, great asset but what happens if there is no architect economies there
129.42,134.22, there's no one who understands the building botheric
134.22,139.44, for i had the things are necessary for that behind her sent
139.59,152.97, nearest would you like to see happen i mean it's it's your talking exactly what i consecrate i want to see us
153.0,156.51, nestorius planning for inclusion
156.75,163.11, to see us be serious about it and not just built in places where there is a disaster
163.14,167.1, i do part of it and i say the disasters now
167.55,178.5, salivation forgather acts that are being passed as a wonderful opportunity to have some knowledge of expertise involved in the process but to who cannot afford it
178.74,182.88, we cannot have a community a city
183.06,186.84, white and overcome
188.28,191.01, variety we need a cushion
191.07,192.78, for
194.22,204.66, we inclusion and the only way is to happen is that people a few become alters and obviously insane for the community deficient
204.81,221.13, so you know you know the person you find here orator so what a man to ask actually an maybe a christian should get involved in all of this because i think 
221.37,234.39, you the representative pointeth this one percent pro bono and what does that involvement actually bring to the firm because i like to talk about not just
234.45,238.98, be taking the old white and man's burden idea
239.16,250.5, jazz get up but really what does it mean to to an architecture from to be involved with this kind of pomona
254.1,255.72, i would say
256.08,259.35, the biggest challenge for us is learning how to be
259.71,261.3, again
261.33,264.87, the protective approach the example that ryan should with 
265.77,267.09, at the best
267.33,272.19, really good at designing buildings were designers were interior designers
272.22,279.48, we do that stuff well but you know these guys have talked about about objects and have putting too much faith in the object
279.48,284.91, we also like us were trained to receive a set of challenges that usually
285.06,288.12, a divine for us they were given a program
288.15,290.01, and you know as
290.01,297.51, you know said of things and were told to take you to her restored here's your your projects a good design it and a really good at that
297.6,305.73, we have to sort of re connect with the idea of going out of the seeing the problem just god without anyone telling us and just going out of looking around and taking that attitude that
305.79,307.53, students of taken sometimes
307.71,310.77, that's our challenge that's what we're learning how to do we've
310.92,317.91, perfect last year through this commitment to the one percent solution we actually have seen on deck right now
317.97,332.88, and these are in addition to the belt line beyond what parkinson and other folks are doing when the belle these are homeless senators there came geraldini health clinic that really significant projects that we expect will
332.97,335.61, he is of this social responsibility
335.64,336.87, initiative
337.17,345.21, most of us have come to us connections and things like that so i will love to see us actually take that challenge me
345.33,347.73, how to go out and
348.0,350.91, men
351.84,357.9, i think maybe i'll call on brian for this one and this he still might
357.9,362.22, i mean there's so much to learn for architects
362.34,376.56, when they're involved with these pro bono projects that he really enriches the practice and constant talk about that a little bit because i think it's really important that it's not about to doing good
376.65,380.58, but making the learning something yourself
381.09,384.57, there were a couple of
385.44,389.73, i mention that i liked to bring up again the
390.27,395.34, a reemphasize the ability to understand
395.76,397.29, and listen
397.56,404.07, we think we're taught communications skills in architecture school that means were very good at talking
404.49,405.81, we don't
406.02,407.58, terrible listening
408.36,414.96, if you look at it if you break down a press or facial presentation is like fifteen minutes of cut
415.05,420.36, so overwhelming to people who are architects so basically shut them up i mean they
422.67,425.4, auctions about 
427.98,434.64, what information the other person wants to know is to know and how how do they receive it
434.94,436.41, but
437.76,442.05, let me just so now this skill that you're talking about 
442.08,445.8, actually a skill said that's why we do these serious projects
445.8,457.77, amazing that we all have that skillet is as you say a collegian's like in a little light switch goes on and they find projects just like we teach all our petitions go out and look at the beautiful freezes and
459.39,461.28, tomatters
461.4,465.93, i never said i had for his eye
466.23,468.96, i do think now
469.71,471.78, go out and you might discover something
473.07,476.76, a low reality check people say
476.76,483.69, you know like the guy with the rest but i mean sometimes our great ideas have a low minimum problem to them
483.78,486.78, somebody whose use and enduring
487.71,492.39, that's a beautiful drawing and everything but let me tell you what it's like to live here
492.39,494.94, and that's why this invitation
495.42,503.91, i mean your works i mean this is the tchentai you're lucky to get because normally what if people and say how i do this i say go find a nonprofit
504.03,510.09, timorous just go there and listen forget your designer for a long time
510.18,512.64, listen and one onderstand
512.91,516.54, about that group and about their knees
516.96,518.34, life
518.43,521.64, start going off like well that's a design 
522.81,538.47, a project that about unemployment there is simply do we walk away and say a wealth were architect we can't do employment but what the problem was as they had of the no child care athenian they had an under trained workforce
538.77,542.46, we proposed a train facility and child care
543.63,554.37, father that was a critical empoisoning problem so asinarian all of those things you've been very patient so i want some hands up
554.85,560.01, anybody anybody wants to add something to the discussion here
562.56,572.55, she only have a public service and ocean unwholesome curator at the centrepieces control and prevention is ably asteroides for the other night 
572.58,575.13, it were seventeen
575.16,578.61, let everybody know that his haveage arises
579.75,588.0, there is in the araucanians from the exhibit in effect on the rear many of the
588.06,600.39, problems issues that postures in the sicilian or very oatlands very madhouses are also feature and exhibit so please come
600.48,602.88, and you notice
604.02,607.08, so anybody's taking issue with any of his
607.11,608.52, i say 
609.57,616.2, somebody to disagree with him does does anybody disagree and say
616.35,620.88, there is a person here are you going to be the contrary
621.27,626.76, coming from a restaurant 
627.21,631.35, designment discussing is the rule of the artist
631.53,633.9, the placability
637.68,640.2, senor
641.55,658.59, yes i hasten i think that's a very important thing i think that there are so many scales all of you having ordinaries many ideas a shipbuilder in this larger discussion
658.71,667.68, i absolutely hethencourt of who we are anybody else from small firms large fortunes
668.07,673.38, some of them may be inspired some of you may say oh my god where do i start

699.99,702.21, yes yes
705.06,706.62, he married for
706.83,715.62, and there were slightly different than the articulation
715.95,718.95, and art oncertainty most powerful
720.51,725.43, and educator onesided
725.73,733.08, it artemidorus
733.11,736.8, this made potatoes
737.01,738.72, a tower
738.87,741.84, on killington but
743.13,745.2, i don't see a reason
747.42,749.7, he wondered
752.1,759.81, a great and stately actually the family business outalisso that time public work
764.34,771.18, i small part of building for the bad part of it all in a room all architects had made
771.18,773.07, that is it
773.16,778.65, i thereupon for as because it particularly in the
778.83,781.95, two great kept up a museum
783.06,786.84, he
787.14,789.84, altamont
791.04,793.23, this
794.61,796.02, you know and
796.71,800.22, prematurity
801.51,807.72, there's a website changed or where the bam
807.72,814.56, listening ideas and one of the ideas on the top ideas as about implementing a sustainable strategy
814.59,817.08, engineers artists
817.14,825.12, i had to go and as suggestion the bottom don't forget desire so you'll be happy to know that aristocles it in the original proposal
825.33,826.77, we had a triumph
827.28,833.13, yea you are probably better known men architects in larger world so
833.46,835.44, oh yes we
835.59,849.21, so polehampton in the arts many of us have signed concedes is no capital let position in either the he has so
849.96,864.0, we have some one with a bannister with architecture and lescombat we started out with the paronsina
866.04,867.93, plato
867.93,874.41, the architect associating and pestered the endearing name developer
874.56,882.6, automobiles bed that architects even when we work for architects
882.63,884.82, in the side
884.94,893.58, you know what i think which is why some men of us leave the protective and go on to other gatehouse we can't control the destiny
893.64,900.24, so i know that it is changing and oversensitive
900.42,919.71, you know we really tried to make it a more plagiaristic changing to make it borabora i haven't heard you guys hogarth necessary collaboration is not only in unceremonious very often the way you get commissions to what you get to what has varieties
919.71,923.79, separate take the indus
923.88,927.6, gettin
927.6,938.67, we hear and we oneadatote radiant i still have to stop with my architect in every single piece of worked
938.76,947.4, to distress in a very tapotte opportunity in the portable house and reviewed before botanising
947.46,974.73, i pandanaceae and caretto me there is another opportunity change that because there are some very rigorous that they say about design but in those of the said architects pottage and yet the continued replicate that saintly testudo tomatoes and let's get some asinaean were here was to tackle it first
975.12,984.99, sairmeuse tethered at carcasonne on one of the ways
985.2,991.8, and significant successful is challenging the amatoor industrial system
992.01,1012.68, when i you know not just doing the things that miss are programme to do but say hey let's stop and think about you know what are the right you know what's the right chemistry for these things literally to make them safe for a world but it requires some one on the greatest
1012.68,1020.09, i think there's some reception itinerant to seven
1020.93,1037.04, i often and he creates a processing things more than building things right working with the parts of pieces of a artist in creating things as pontedera
1037.04,1052.4, i think there's a priority to challenge codes i mean i don't know that i had national code i really set out to allow designers artisans creatively
1052.43,1055.76, in some streets
1056.18,1063.77, so we are in whose writings carterette and went to the city regional planning program used to be architects to write these coats
1063.95,1073.7, you're exactly right i mean the question of affordable housing is no different than the question of art but again what we're doing is here privilege each of these individual elements within the city that makes the city rich
1073.7,1125.09, question we asked ourselves prior to that question is what kind o city in urban environment what kind of city do we want to live in if we want to live in a banbury that we're doing exactly what we should be doing if we want to live in a tedious
1125.18,1162.14, her ability to own hand guns for that future generation we got to have a year captain people and live in a land they're going to say now what we're going to suffer through some of these traffic issues so that our children grandchildren who walk around without that nothing will ever get done and they're doing in denver and doing it they are doing these things in different cities right now we can see it getting done and we don't do it and is because we therewithin and may have a political structure is our right as individuals in our obligations to the collective and we are not sitting in this room as were all great people in disintegration is all about white otter taxes you know why should we pay palaces as has got it
1162.14,1176.96, and fordable housing keeping elderly people whose neighborhood we have an obligation to do that and it comes to patmore taxes and comes down to that very simple issue and desires not console that harroway the less we understand the political language
1176.99,1184.94, go out and actively engaged in these initiatives possibly my students are never going to solve before housing problem it is a political issue
1185.06,1201.38, people interfere their taxes don't go up people that are moving and there developers their taxes go up and i saw it saw the we are not willing to do that right now not to people in this room again but the city as a political meditatively
1202.04,1210.92, i hope that we see the emergence of the notion of us understanding our obligation to the collective
1211.46,1216.74, it sounds to me like the people in this room have a lot to a lot of influence
1217.13,1221.06, you can you can do some design activist here
1221.06,1236.69, recommendations poitanian raised
1239.6,1243.74, he awoke
1243.92,1252.5, he pushed hard with a anakhitu with some of the projects that were going on in the downtown at
1257.63,1268.55, he came to officeholders just as school into one of them in his head while he was there the architect testament the project there 
1269.06,1272.72, you can't
1273.08,1280.16, artisans ekaterinograd project 
1280.91,1295.16, very diverse turndown there people lived in the neighbourhood for ever better still there and there were interspersed now houses there and so i think
1296.42,1300.32, it happen attitude everybody that one panel 
1300.86,1303.62, however
1303.65,1304.61, but
1305.45,1313.19, take note italic how do you think it
1313.22,1315.92, early
1316.82,1328.4, there's also the other issue here which is salable more easily reinecourt is that how do you all learn to collaborate which was one of the questions asked i mean
1328.4,1333.86, it isn't about somebody's ego in is about pulling together
1333.86,1339.98, all kinds of knowledge in order to do the very best i can can and
1341.12,1350.6, of openings do we have about the idea of collaboration we talk about this all the time anybody says they're doing it apparently not
1350.63,1354.92, in some cases we are not involved in this
1355.19,1358.73, and that should be a last word here who is going to
1358.73,1362.06, so laborer we go and have drink
1362.27,1378.62, and collaboration will like to come like the whole pessecutin is unfortunate for booboorowie before
1380.45,1385.49, the professor off with having a neighborhood antsister
1385.52,1387.23, a system 
1387.32,1389.93, welcome
1390.14,1400.97, as crenellations
1401.15,1405.32, someone
1405.56,1408.02, a house
1408.17,1413.15, it was a overheard
1413.57,1415.82, then an
1417.74,1423.23, the renaissance had
1423.47,1431.75, principaliter cant of botanical
1433.97,1443.15, what the wise general president a very feminine to have hundreds of a formal apartments
1443.42,1456.29, i have seen a afforestation to provide a fifteen per cent of that that is lady petitioners jacinto in present
1456.47,1459.74, and people ladies
1459.74,1470.87, i was nothing else the good ones that they would understand that that is important to understand why she portienhorn rene
1472.49,1478.37, godhaven you have opportunities here in the lane there are coming your way by the droves
1478.43,1482.75, you can get involved and you can get all of this great stuff done
1482.78,1485.78, an be our all activities
1485.87,1498.65, then be active is going away and you teonontogen involved and not let the low the affordable housing go out of the neighborhood it is richer to be in a neighbour there are kids at grandma's and
1498.71,1507.14, all kinds of faces interocean friends who love to walk through manhattan for instance
1507.32,1509.66, they come from these binoculars
1509.66,1525.17, my god look at this amazing variety of people in how exciting it is i rather be on the street than anywhere else because we have a culture that built this unamusing mixtures of people in that oretes
1525.26,1546.11, he said we all need to think about how do we celebrate that instead of trying to deny it so gulfward heartiness and going at a drink and by some worsted
