217.74,219.21, publication well
219.51,228.18, it around the time of the last council and since then the sale of the book condensation or practical companion for me than
229.14,238.14, tangerine and we've been able to send him free copies of the book to see us around the world because people have donated their own copy
238.83,245.73, and a spanish translation and that will be published so and grateful to lees render
245.82,248.52, has been checking the finished completion for me
250.5,259.35, and did she had a fifteenth of may international conscience diction day and was i think quite big event comparison
259.38,264.09, rollaround the world best creeps in countries where this conscription
264.15,266.97, acting in solidarity with ceased
267.09,269.61, the tomato highlight
269.79,274.62, merely through conscience subject repression
275.28,282.57, maybe think about ways in which your group can you use th of may as noceat with others intonation
282.69,285.09, send the word about concentration
285.72,290.1, and as the men were also working on a wet resource
290.1,293.76, for refuses especially in the eastern european region
294.24,296.31, in russia ukraine
296.43,303.03, for example and perhaps better as well whether it laceration in some cases
303.06,304.98, in some cases
305.07,308.55, and how you gain rights to condensation where they exist
308.82,310.77, in terms of
310.86,312.84, in neighbouring countries
313.17,315.42, that resource at the moment
315.87,319.47, you have contact in any of the countries that i've listed
319.74,322.23, i would be really glad to hear from me
322.98,331.71, many of these countries there is a risk to being in touch with international organizations and were very happy to take kind of necessary security
331.98,333.54, and
334.02,335.49, communication
335.61,336.57, manage that
337.89,347.01, as usual we been spreading kind of awareness of condensation through hours update which is a news letter that get set
347.16,350.85, around two or three months this gives news conscription
351.0,353.34, conviction around the world
353.7,356.28, if you're not subtract that the other link
357.42,359.28, and it'd be great to shatter
359.97,364.26, i think with the only international organization that sharing that is regularly
364.44,369.84, countries everywhere and for all types of objection to so i think it's quite an important result
371.25,378.93, secondly we regularly send out so alone so late are advocacy alert where we ask you to
380.49,381.87, sorties
382.02,385.77, countries when conscience is imprisoned
385.92,388.68, risk of the tension or
389.01,390.63, winsome of the way
392.13,396.57, a great way so informing people about what the situation is for so
396.75,403.29, it's kind of potentially making a difference to individuals to be great if we could get more people send up to that well
404.76,405.66, the
405.69,408.24, on a new website
408.24,412.89, i should be really obvious how to subscribe to the new letters
413.25,415.35, so were creating a
415.38,416.25, and
416.25,419.46, in a way in which you can see werily the countries
419.58,422.88, coincided for
423.21,424.89, what inscription solicits
425.1,427.05, basically using information
427.14,430.29, we have but trying to make him more as
431.64,434.01, last the assayer
434.1,438.6, to say that the joseph round to art would dress who finds
438.63,441.87, to kill greatheart to extend that
442.41,446.7, we have funding for this work until at least
447.75,451.17, with the king for more ways to work on particular project
451.41,455.79, and allows the kind of fun that so if he have any suggestions
456.09,458.13, as if a please get in touch
459.42,463.53, so now the thread is a chance to think about was the
463.56,467.19, i used to kill program working feature
467.46,472.83, well as continuing the kind of traditional work we do i suppose superintendent abettors
473.28,477.03, it's possible to see the work of the refuse to kill program
477.21,478.68, in most german
478.89,486.15, a refusal to take part in militarism in many forms if you have ideas watherford
