0.06,9.75, i 
12.03,36.24, i rebury my name is jason with andy in to day we're going to give you an inductive of the most light made bison now this is the second gamble that they had on the market and as the name suggests this is more aimed towards the lighter cameras like mirrorless all the way up to a canimar three opinion lends you have on it so without further do let's give you a nice walk through of the features of this new gimble
36.9,50.37, the basic comes in at ten ninety nine and basically all you would get as the gamble we go to the premium tear at twelve ninety nine and what that's going to give you is the gamboni as well as a wireless remote control
50.7,62.85, and then at fifteen nine is the poverson where you would get the gamble the wires remote wireless monitor kit and you also get this pelicans
62.88,66.27, case to store and transport your gamble
67.53,89.4, one of the things that you can see as far if you're familiar with the original ms that it is much smaller than before and basically what they've done is they've kind of tinned everything out a little bit so that i can carry just the weight of your lighter camera now the one cool thing is that it still remains to last which is great
89.55,98.13, and the one thing that i do enjoy is that you now have a much longer quick release plate than before which makes adjusting your
98.25,114.0, lens is on the go much easier instead of having to disconnect the quick release slighted to one particular spot in the lock it back down now you can basically just kind of generally attach to your camera body and you should be able to accommodate from light to heavier lenses
115.02,136.44, another feature that we have is if you take a look we have on the provision this wireless received a trans transmitter unit and basically what this allows you to do is you can transmit to a wireless monitor it's an este but at least give you an idea as part as far as framing your shots
137.7,148.2, now if you take a look at the back here right now we have a cannon even attached and what we're able to do is here able to go from the use or in the back
148.65,173.52, the sport in the side and if you get either the premium or pro version what you can do it you can use your wireless remote to either stop and start recording and a really cool thing is there is a little wheel here on the back and depending on which way you turn it you can actually focus your lands just make sure your lens is in manual focus mode
174.42,188.88, now that call feature only works on canon cameras and unfortunately does not work on one and or peasant might be something that they may be able to do later in the future but for now you're pretty much just stuck to canon if you want to be able to focus from the wireless remote
188.94,205.11, so when one to connect your can camera on to the mosasaurus one of the supply us cables to go into the sport you're going to long hold on the options to bring up a second man go down to camera
205.59,207.75, quick right to enter that manu
208.11,211.26, using a yell
212.28,219.36, and this is an actual fairly heavy lands is not one of the plastic style one oothaba
221.1,223.26, going to retaliate itself
225.39,226.86, once done
227.43,230.04, had the option managin to go out of it
230.73,233.37, from there you're able to start moving
236.19,241.2, and from there you able to start moving the lens focus laconism
243.51,258.87, no i can see here it is slowly stepping each time and that no fault of its own that's just kind of how these ones were bills now i'm not exactly sure what would happen if you put an estaminet front of it but at least for now
259.26,264.0, click is as one step as far as how the land is focusing
265.44,283.17, one thing to keep in mind with a set up here as far as the pro version and all the other versions it does not actually come with a stand so what they've done is with the most light you're able to actually calibrated and balance your gamble without the need of a stand you just need a flat surface
283.71,289.71, so for people that don't have a stand what you would do is first to get a remove the top handle
310.23,321.24, tayoga you're going to set it out to its top rotator handles
326.61,329.52, market down
336.99,344.61, the one thing about this set up it is you can't actually have your wiles remote
346.14,349.77, the correct upright position you're going to have to make sure
349.83,352.44, push it down
354.21,355.74, the demon
356.04,357.87, flat
357.9,364.44, this point your basically able to get to all your controls as far as how you want to balance it
364.56,367.23, and if you don't want to have to set up
367.23,369.48, and while balancing your game
369.84,390.93, you have in this inverted mode you're basically able to balance now while this is very convenient where you don't have to bring a stand everywhere you go the problem is is this is probably only very possible entertained a very flat surface to do the balancing now when you're done
391.17,404.31, problem arises is that your hands are not exactly where you would like them to be if you were operating an inverted mode you would actually have to try and actually have someone hold it for you
404.49,426.18, unscrew these nobs and then face it the right way now say you do want to operate it like this the problem is is a kind of limits certain movements that you can do is not terrible but what i would say you shouldn't do is hold it out here because it's actually very top heavy right now and it causes
426.42,436.17, these attachment points of the handles to become the weak spot and so you're probably going to have to paint like this however when you do it this way
438.36,440.97, and you one i use your wireless remote
441.81,446.94, tidal by myself here as if nobody was actually with me on a shoe
450.57,451.77, right
453.15,460.44, you know end up probably using your left thumb generally speaking it works okay
460.77,464.37, again it's not exactly the 
465.45,468.63, we were used to operate in gambles and inverted out
474.15,514.44, now as far as actually balancing your camera everything is done with a toast a sign which is great so you don't actually need any screw drivers now it's actually fairly simple everything has its own little adjustments and there is clear markings to help you remember exactly where each parts are if you are going to be changing lenses on your gambles often now we won't go through this altogether but we have done some balancing videos before is very similar you have your cure place of sidebotham this rail here to go left in bright and then you also have the side screecher to adjust
514.47,524.31, and down and then of course lastly we have the real adjustments back here so i'll send you a link here if you need help learning how to balance your camera
525.06,557.37, okay so the shell how quick we can actually rebalance from a can seventy to a judge for a missing keith over here now he comes from back in the day where we had a use screw drivers and all it was just a nightmare a balance so this is his first time working with a completely tool is to sign minnesota for the cure plate so i'm going to use a stop watch to time and to see how fast he goes i'll stand by in case he has anquetin so here we go three to one click
565.86,568.53, back
593.49,598.44, you just kind of fast forward through all the
599.91,607.83, i can say and right now and you astonished
610.5,612.24, speed now
618.81,622.68, i came missus for your voice ever track then
622.86,627.81, so the first thing he did was he took off the car played from cambremer one
628.83,638.49, now still the only part of this is that's not to louis the little quarter under the queer place so you have still nearer of some kind but you can easily exchange it
638.52,640.68, for during type set up
641.64,646.86, got the cure play on to the chorus now putting it
648.06,649.59, the
652.14,657.03, now he's balancing the front and back ends of the camera make sure the lens
677.85,680.31, much easier without 
696.99,698.25, you're 
698.94,705.9, all right so now he's got the camera balance as far as finback by as he said before it still
706.11,707.64, has a tendency of
708.03,713.58, swinging down so what that means is its bottom having so now he's got a raise
714.18,716.34, the camera
725.94,727.5, where two fifty
745.59,754.17, wiseacre don't need it for the decor taking off the cannon cable here
757.29,766.35, the table and an usher away and easier waited to do this portion is if you
766.98,768.78, on these bigger gambols
768.93,776.37, you would actually just go this way and that then a just from there he
780.69,784.98, once you find the happy medium issued just stay there on its own
785.91,790.56, starbottom yea still botany
804.72,808.05, he giveth test
816.48,817.08, he
843.48,846.42, confusing as on the other way
848.13,849.18, it
851.91,852.96, i
855.48,862.41, arracon the bottom so you can actually pull and give it an extra
862.5,863.85, on
871.2,872.49, i 
895.98,898.17, currently
901.77,903.39, five and a half
909.21,912.09, looks like it more or less balanced
915.99,916.83, he
918.03,928.65, see here is the problem though if we do it this way there's no way for us to really actually calibre the yallar
932.85,933.93, corner
935.82,939.39, he had had
939.42,941.25, i 
948.51,953.37, but if i do it this way when the yacht
957.54,960.18, i think about fighting
965.64,967.23, the
967.26,970.47, because if you pulled this way 
971.28,976.05, that is they would cottiswoode
977.79,979.17, he moved in
979.17,982.05, moriway
984.96,987.39, holding
987.54,994.47, that means to me because doing it that way the wettest as will naturally swing that way 
998.94,1000.29, go forward
1007.52,1008.81, the
1008.81,1013.04, really weird lines
1013.49,1014.3, he
1021.38,1029.51, all right no that word can use that part 
1030.08,1037.94, i want to move in agonies
1037.97,1040.76, okay all right so
1046.46,1049.91, less five minutes 
1058.52,1060.32, i do happen
1085.01,1096.83, restoring you so wrong aylight so the one thing it is when you're going to be testing out if you're your
1096.83,1102.5, if you're a bars actually in balance what you're going to do is you going to place one hand on this side
1102.62,1104.6, slowly lift
1105.02,1106.85, the other if it's balanced
1107.24,1110.51, actually swing anywhere 
1110.81,1112.31, can do it 
1112.85,1115.16, a test it on the other side as well
1118.7,1123.59, i i the than that that's pretty much balanced and just under ten minutes
1126.95,1143.39, it's another we got the camera balanced love go through the three shooting modes of we can do now one quick now when you're going in between these shooting modes sometimes especially if you're going from invertor you're going to need a power off your gambler turning it over so
1144.86,1146.18, first
1147.47,1151.01, contour regular mode
1154.28,1156.17, all right
1161.09,1168.86, power on indian see because of the way you had to balance these handles need to be
1169.76,1171.26, over
1186.59,1190.97, when parasite you happy was lock everything down
1192.41,1193.82, there you go
1195.47,1201.59, same thing if you're going to want to go into inverted mon turn off your gamble
1211.76,1218.39, ossory trafalgar the right handle here
1223.82,1224.99, all right
1242.06,1243.26, you go
1247.28,1249.65, want to go in a brief case on
1250.07,1254.15, to go back to the regular mode her real quick i'm going to turn off the gamble
1273.53,1277.61, and what you go on i needed as you're going to have to
1278.57,1280.76, all the handle bar to you
1281.03,1282.38, and wrote
1282.98,1284.84, now you're a pretty case out
1288.62,1291.98, think if you want to go away from it wrote
1295.91,1297.17, a
1298.25,1354.05, and
1354.38,1481.97, he
1482.33,1519.86, there are some test photostat we did with the most alive now when you're operating in just the regular shooting mode and but inverting mode you can see that it's actually really really smoothish pretty much no no differ walls the most light definitely does a really good job there now for the running tests we did it in three configurations the first one was rothamstead with the top handle that second run we ran with it in inverted mode and then the third one we ran with it in brief casemate now all three shooting styles they're not perfect
1519.95,1549.29, they're not bad either because if you take a look back at our came made you would see that when we ran with it there is huge horizontal shape that would happen when i got really unsteady you don't really see that with the molinillo more of just a little bit of a role that being said it doesn't do bad at all as far as the running tests
1549.41,1555.11, as far as the most alike goes the performance is admirable it does a really good job but
1555.5,1583.94, were the most seems to be having the most problem is actually in the physical design of the gamble itself now as i had already said before it doesn't come with a stand you either have to already have a stand or you could purchase one and for additional cost and what happens is if you are not in a studio environment where you have a nice flat surface of any kind and you're actually shooting on location is going to be a pain because yolande bars just so you can get
1583.97,1593.18, gimblet up completely balanced so that's one now as far as independent film makers go chances are your probably shooting
1593.36,1638.96, yourself so if that's the case and you have it balanced you'd have to single handedly fandangle with all these screws by yourself to move the handles to where you need them not to mention you can balance the gamble with the top handle installed so that's another thing that you have to go ahead and attach if you if you're planning using the top handle another couple things here is some of the screws are just straight up regular thumb screws were as the only ones as seemed to be rated are the ones out over i think back here the silver ones these are rather can pull it out and readjust it would be nice if they were all you know just consistent in the same
1639.05,1652.79, your bar is a little bit hard to adjust but the one thing that i found it instead of trying to move the entire unit it seems that easy as if you just take your thumbs and really push on
1653.48,1659.93, two notches out here but even then it's not a smooth motion you actually have to put quite a bit of force to it
1660.71,1662.87, now
1663.17,1673.16, for the test that we did we decided to go with the broken on millimeter with a speed booster traditionally all our videos we would use the volante but
1673.55,1682.88, most light does better with heavier lenses and heavier cameras because what happens is this if you have the volante if you tilt
1683.21,1697.79, i otanethi take a gamble and youth health it this way you're going to start hearing a rather horrible motor noise coming for i think that you motor so having the heavier lands kind of negates that
1698.33,1710.0, now for people that are shooting with sonia asses or maybe you don't use heavier manual crimes may be you use on a panionius lenses which are much lighter
1716.03,1721.64, especially if you're using a prime what happens here is you have to raise
1722.0,1723.59, the bottom part
1723.92,1734.84, to compensate and what happens is is this screw right here on the bottom and he actually hitting this notch so
1737.12,1751.31, just one of those things it's going to effect as far as if you're going to be doing any extreme movements or if you're kind of fanning about it doesn't have enough clearance so usually heavier cameras going to do a little bit better 
1751.46,1773.18, now this gamble that we have here is actually part of the second production on the first production unhandsome thing wrong with this piece right here where most people cannot balance their cameras properly but it seems that the second beseems have fixed the problem because we were as you saw able to balance at a cannon seventy as well as a corwin problems
1773.69,1797.87, now as far as the remote control goes is actually not bad however there is a slight little quirk now if you're going to move the camera right laughed up down that's fine however if you're deciding that you wanted to kinda pan at a diagonal this remote does not allow you to do so if you go at a diagonal whichever censor it hits first is either going to go up
1797.99,1826.28, on i'm not sure if that's something that can be fixed in a firm where or if it's actually just a limitation of the thumb controller itself but otherwise i really do like that we now have an elsie screen that your menus are access through his eldred houseen a battery read out for what the gimbals currently at as well as the remote other than that it is definitely a nice improvement compared to the first remote
1827.84,1851.21, one thing that we did notice as far as the focusing wheel here on the cannon cameras it's a little bit finicky as to when it actually works sometimes when you calibrated it to the camera and works right off the bat and some other times it doesn't we're not exactly sure why it doesn't work percent of the time but it's probably a firm where issue that can be addressed at a later date
1852.74,1867.77, now another thing by design is the screws that a comes with you have screws that go on the curate you have screws that go into the back of the remote you have another screw that goes
1868.04,1872.03, you monitor the problem is as some of these screws
1872.39,1875.21, i require something a stick as a quarter
1875.75,1891.35, or as the thin as a dime they're not consistent all the way across so that is definitely something that should be unified so that you wouldn't have to have a bunch of coins with you but at the same time i'm not sure why no one has done this yet
1891.35,1895.82, these are i believe these are all just quarters or something similar
1895.94,1912.17, we should really honestly just have the rings are ready instead of using still having to use a screw driver for the little parts they come with pretty much every aequales plates out there so i would say to switch over to de rings and make it a lot esther
1913.01,1932.18, so in conclusion is the most light something that i would recommend at this point in time you know there was a lot of high hopes as to this being the next person cause if you're familiar with the first mesa that one was that one performed really well but between the former issues and some of the physical
1932.18,1951.41, design of this i would actually say wait if you don't have a gambol yet i would say wait for the third batch as they start remedying all these problems because we've seen them we've seen them put out a really quality product before and i would say by the third production on we should be seeing something that everyone will be happy with
