559.89,564.63, see with our own eyes the image that you have for us
566.4,568.11, all these things
568.26,581.4, sweetheart i am alone
581.61,584.73, i say ever
584.85,589.56, see
589.77,594.96, he is a 
595.02,600.54, the fore
603.18,652.71, he oleomargarine 
656.01,670.32, reading from john chapter six versus twenty four to thirty five so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they themselves got into the boats and went to capernaum looking for jesus
670.38,676.17, when they found him on the other side of the sea they said to him read by when did you come here
676.92,703.32, jesus an should them very truly i tell you you're looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate your fill of blows do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life which the son of man will give you for it is on him that god the father has set his seal then they said to him what must we do to perform the works of god
703.86,710.22, answered them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he has sent
710.46,717.45, so they said to him what in are you going to give us then so that we may see it and believe you
717.63,719.73, work are you performing
720.0,738.12, ancestors at the men in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said to them very truly i tell you it was not moses who gave you the bread from heaven but it is my father he gives you the true bread from heaven
738.15,745.62, for the bread of god is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world they said to him sir
745.77,747.48, the spray
747.99,751.56, he said to them i am the bread of life
751.92,757.5, come to me will never be hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty
764.37,793.98, there are so many ways to read and study the bible and one of them that i try sometimes as to pick a person in the bible story one person and to read that story from that person's perspective and wonder what would she be thinking in the middle of all that or what would he be feeling when all that was going on and reddest from that person's perspective so i'm going to ask us to try that to day and ask you to imagine just for a few minutes
794.13,796.74, you are jesus
797.1,804.96, your jesus and you are at the table and you are troubled
805.32,832.38, no it's not that you have trouble with difficult dinner table conversation that's not your master and those because your ministry has been at the table for years now and it makes sense because everybody eats hopefully we eat every day and sometimes we eat we sit down and we relax and we talk with each other about the day and the things that are exciting us in the things that are worrying us and
832.38,843.03, sharing a meal with somebody and be a great way to get to know them at a deeper level so those meal times are very very worth
843.78,857.61, if they're not always that simple and with you mealtimes are not always that simple because ever since the scribes and fairies started really paying attention to who you were and who you were eating with
857.94,872.22, they have been scandalized and it really it didn't surprise you that much because you expect people to fumble a little bit when they come up against new ideas and different situations and unfamiliar people
872.52,883.47, expect that the new unfamiliar the different that's part of life that's part of growing and sometimes life and growing can be so difficult that we go by
883.89,886.17, in these labels
886.26,896.37, that man he attacked collector and the work that he is doing just the job that he has says it all you can't trust him for 
896.55,898.11, woman the sinner
898.56,908.16, life style that she's living the choices that she's making the it doesn't matter why she's doing what she's doing as long as she's living that way
909.03,917.79, then when we make labels we don't even have to deal with the people we just deal with the labels and so
917.79,920.85, teiresias described so you
920.88,925.68, with tax collectors and centers they saw you taking the risk
925.68,930.6, looking behind the label and seeing the people
930.93,933.81, course that made them feel uncomfortable
934.5,935.64, and
936.06,939.84, it trouble you that much when they
939.99,947.13, question you or criticized you for that because you knew that it meant they were dealing with the difficult questions 
947.31,949.8, does faith mean here
950.1,951.15, now
951.84,965.91, important questions are important because every fish and low multiplied on those slopes of gaily and re conversation and a soup kitchen table every meal shared with those hungry kids
966.63,973.44, one of those meals is a chance for people to catch a glimpse of their lives held
973.56,975.99, your grace
976.29,980.88, meals are so worth it but
981.36,983.52, however divine you may be
983.82,988.62, also human and sometimes at the end of the day when you
989.01,1016.31, had all your energy out there and you spent time with people who don't really know who you are and they don't know what on earth to make a few sometimes it would be nice to know that somebody was going to be there because humaneness that our parents spouses children sisters brothers friends friends in the faith of the people we love are going to see the good in us and are going to be looking out for our good
1016.31,1017.63, at that
1017.9,1022.31, now that the people we love don't always live up to that
1022.73,1037.13, you seen it you've seen the family's torn apart the friend who barely look at each other any more the churches and synagogues that are split because people who want desperately to live the faith
1037.31,1040.19, don't agree on how to do it
1041.36,1042.62, that
1043.01,1046.49, what's troubling you to day because
1046.7,1048.29, this table
1048.56,1053.3, here are some of the people closest to you in the world and
1053.42,1055.07, you know what's going on
1055.07,1056.57, you've heard you've seen it
1056.81,1061.46, judiciary it is this close to being done with you
1062.3,1082.49, and after everything that he seen this man has experienced the hungry getting fed and people captive to all sorts of things getting set free and and all those ways big and small that grace creeps in and changes this world he has seen it and his heart was starting to mount
1083.18,1085.01, was melting
1085.4,1087.02, now he's gotten scared
1087.53,1089.54, an angry
1089.6,1100.19, that rome is still occupying the country and beating people down with its economic policies and military presence angry that the people are still hurting
1100.37,1104.24, that he is still hurting and that life still isn't fair
1104.57,1108.38, you know you have fixed everything yet
1109.46,1114.11, getting so angry that he is forgetting the miracles
1114.11,1119.27, forgetting the life that you have shared together and you can tell
1119.3,1121.73, he's already made the decision
1121.73,1131.84, already decided to go tell them where they can find you so they can come do whatever it is they think they want to do with you as if he didn't
1131.84,1134.12, i care
1135.26,1137.18, to people like that
1139.46,1142.1, only one thing to do with people like that
1153.56,1155.3, the bread
1156.32,1170.36, the sign of friendship and he is your friend even if he had inglesant see the reality of god's power to redeem and reclaim every one and everything
1170.81,1172.16, still true
1172.31,1177.05, grace is still the way this world is put together so you
1180.02,1184.22, and yes yes she will deny you he will doubt you
1184.43,1190.43, love is what you do with people let's been your point all along and you offer
1190.52,1203.69, yes they may absolutely turn their backs on the rich people poor people black brown red yellow white people for being different from being wrong for being selfish you
1203.93,1211.46, keep looking behind the labels and welcoming them all to use the gifts you have given them
1211.67,1215.69, bless this world you keep offering
1218.36,1226.19, there's only one thing to do with people like that and people like that and people like that and people like this
1226.64,1228.92, you offer the bread
1229.25,1231.44, as you have loved them
1232.43,1234.53, they will learn to love each other
1235.73,1238.1, so you keep offering this
1238.79,1240.47, giving
1242.81,1244.01, god
1246.62,1328.61, the terebinthine

1344.12,1347.57, who live in different places and speak differently
1347.93,1350.84, we've been reminded that god
1350.9,1354.08, and jesus christ are far bigger
1354.23,1356.69, then any small group of us
1357.05,1360.5, he reminded and we are reminded of fresh
