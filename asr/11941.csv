14.58,17.22, say we are going to make candy walnuts
17.61,34.11, we can't just have the candied walnuts so we're going to put them in a salad i have a fresh eric which has some baby spinach a rule other baby leave letters some herbs in there like parsley and slanted so it'll be very tasty and a little bit spicy for the candy wallets
34.17,61.77, i have a couple of long upedes and what we're going to do is to them a little bit to warm em up and open them up so when we make the balsamic reduction and put the nuts in there they'll be willing to soak up that reduction were going to throw some beans in the oven to roast those to add to her salad and then we're going to mix all the lettuces that already premised i did get a bad let us because this is all about convenient and eating healthy and vegetarian and then we're going to add some cranberry
62.1,70.98, here the goat cheese has cranberry around the outside so added additional bit of tangier to the salad when it's all sudden done
71.07,73.89, don't we get started on making those candy walnuts
74.07,87.78, start with roasting the walnuts a little bit to open them up as we mentioned before on going to do is put the chapeau on to a dish
88.29,89.58, and
89.73,92.04, along with the beads
92.46,100.11, stick em in the oven the wantonly do for about ten minutes a thinner fifty degrees but i'm in the keep the beats and there until their tender
104.76,105.9, while
106.92,111.33, going to do is we're going to start the reduction while that's going for minutes
111.54,125.16, i know people say that you should be particular about the type of wine that you use in cooking i'm nor nearest particular so what i'm going to do as i have some red wine i used three quarters of a cup of that
127.89,130.62, moaned there's not enough of this one
130.77,135.06, what move to another bottle as i said i'm not particular
141.87,146.55, and then the good old balsamic vinegar a going to add half a cup of that
158.82,159.81, i
160.62,164.43, and we're going to turn the stove top
164.88,213.27, medium high and poor that in so we can reduce this we're going to add about a tablespoon of brown sugar half a tea spoon of cinnamon a little bit of an ill for some extra flavour and stir if the reduction starts to boil turn the heat down to medium low so it is simmering reduced by about a third about ten minutes at that point and the warm women stirred to make sure all the nattered with the liquid i prefer walnuts because they are an excellent source of the magareys tried different types of nuts to find your favorite continue to cook on a medium heat until the liquid dissolves and creates a nice glaze over the nuts remove from he
214.2,233.85, here is a herb salad with fresh rested beats goat cheese that is crusted in cranberries and then last but not least are homemade candied walnuts with the balsamic vinegar red wine a little bit of cinnamon brown sugar and vanilla
