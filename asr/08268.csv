415.95,420.39, do you call the tender absurdities
420.96,426.54, what aspect of your nature do you explore when you're thinking
426.6,429.81, and right and hopefully writing after the thinking
429.87,443.19, and the question is a good one of my response is i'm always assessing and making full hopefully full use of the poet and the persons sense of whimsy
443.88,466.44, because what underlies all of the thinking all the poetry here and elsewhere over the past sixteen or so years has to do with my having to pleasure myself by having as much fun as i can john with the language and thus if i do that with all sincerity and goodness of heart then i can be proud of what it is that i am sharing with the public because it makes them feel better
466.68,468.69, next question
