19.38,113.91, paradise a regular visitor to to act immunity over the years paula historian writer philosopher and an artist whose currently cheer and clear creative place research thinkin university he's also the director of the diaconate and dig of the divider of the center for memory imagination and invention paul's author many books many concerned with australian history and australian places and their identity most recently granting which was an examination of the place that we know is that the male and in particular relationship of the part to unseen and jolly or macheson indigenous character pause particularly interested in the poetics of place making and public space design and the applications of the sort of creative research to community renewal strategic planning and policy for formulation and i can say that he definitely a friend of this community with his assistance to projects currently underway here particularly in relation to the oratorios and of course as an outporter of palaces to noting carriage to guanahani along the sand which is a collaborative work delaplaine this one probably follow poor oriana dog he
113.94,133.2, he is also responsible for the varmint design of near new theories surface treatment of many of us will alteration squares if that poor aid like to introduce you and welcome to palaces number plate i've called this talk at connections that function
133.2,142.77, and what i want to do is to introduce you to a tenth century sometimes quarter
142.86,172.23, by the time james dawson are keeping this adequate appropriate as you know who is james darton on to sir james be kinder or boomerang because he was actually was a failed distiller from scotland so he decently have accidentally connection james dawson established a kind of mixed sheep and cattle run in southwestern victory robert six after coming out from scotland
172.44,175.41, he had
175.56,178.2, association with
178.35,192.33, the analogies are some years he was a very long lived and that not in a victor at the century
192.51,200.61, and i wanted to discuss some investigations that
200.82,204.66, a group of us been making into his heritage is like as
204.99,213.84, i do that here that's really what i want to come to because i think that particularly in the context of the last
213.87,215.1, on
215.31,220.14, it's not in the case that we need to think about collective
220.26,239.49, agents of collaboration and other words different segments or stake holders or parts of the community that will come together to produce better up comes with the environment and therefore for ourselves and it's also at the case that we individually have to
239.49,252.75, achieve integrated understandings of the different parts of our brains and bodies and our relationships with those around us james dawson and is a proposition about research was exemplary in their respect
252.99,255.63, it was somebody who brought together
255.63,260.04, in with extraordinary poise common sense
260.07,263.16, and courage set of interests
263.4,266.49, in other words he was a proto
266.49,288.24, make a better future and a large part of his career the western district his writings more importantly perhaps even his actions were exemplary somebody who refused to allow environment to be separated from issues of social justice
288.33,295.11, refused to allow the history and vision to forget and indeed to supersede
295.11,297.9, fully functioning indigenous cultures
298.08,304.95, who was concerned for animals who is concerned for the trees but all he was a public intellectual
305.94,307.92, interesting
308.04,309.33, this is 
309.63,322.41, it points but there's no record of the of him what sovereign which is a town for years the background to animal about him to day
322.77,339.81, is again another concert which i think is implicit next miss it's art for example and probably intransitive oped for hospital system is the concept of a creative region
340.29,356.55, already in that term were bringing together as an sciences both of which hypothesis possible states which replenish what is become eroded through instrument his reason ideology paganism created regions are regions understood is generative
356.94,362.46, were all familiar with the uncreative region that's the one that federal government might have been posed on us
362.55,372.33, we are always at the bottom of the food chain awaiting something to be handed down which generally speaking is a kind of monocular response to a complex situation
372.36,380.01, further reduces a capacity to think for ourselves created regions reverse that so in the book round true the 
380.22,386.67, i brought out last year i tried to make the case with the male as a creative region
387.12,399.24, and a picture of the creative region is that it's understood relation that is as many many layers paleness of journeys
399.6,408.81, all journeys are poetic journeys poetic thinking is essentially the relating of places that were formerly far apart
409.11,412.08, all poems are basically regions
412.14,414.6, the kinds of poetic geography
414.72,420.87, so to think about a region as i did through the words of john chanson was partly to reinterpret nelson
420.9,422.28, colleges
422.34,429.51, and as a stutter of rapidly sort of fragmenting environment
430.17,437.7, credere also situation in other words you can't just take what you find in the male and upon the western district
437.79,449.43, they are fundamentally different regional imperatives cultural histories environmental orders that operate in these related
449.49,462.3, but different regions so great regions are situation ventosa that they come from something they are kicked off by something as they build around certain kinds of nuclei
462.57,467.7, for me in writing about the male for a whole set of reasons to do with
469.35,475.92, he set investments and indigenous investments i focused on lattermath
475.92,488.97, the militant least because of the ambiguity of the word tyrrwhit is variously rendered in english to mean something like void space dark heaven
489.33,490.38, expense
490.59,496.74, it's a term that is taken probably from indigenous languages
496.89,499.11, but its sense
499.23,503.52, a by cultural sense in other words it emerges for us now
503.61,508.05, translation where it's been assimilated to ideas of the open
508.44,511.83, a place of possibility a place of possible meeting
512.31,524.07, so in that sense the the vision like the creative mitford at that part of the malaita iona i took advantage of a particular feature in the landscape
524.76,534.84, the other feature about criterions as they are into regional and the words they're not top down regions that have a kind of
534.99,544.17, come say a sort of policy fence around them you know they stopped at the lodestone of the golden or somebody stops down river from detonation
544.26,546.12, ragnar internal
546.21,550.08, so my view is has been at the turtle story that reasons all the way down
550.74,562.65, the with you in manhattan the males to some extent a region you can talk to and it works the other way increasingly probably what i mean by that is a region
562.71,567.15, larger version of journeys
567.3,573.36, and particularly as arsonists journeys always involved coming from somewhere else
573.63,577.71, i suppose so much of the pain and horror of 
577.77,590.31, history has been about the attempt to trate across those journeys and then defied over which silenus ould be rather than actually realizing that the journey is not a line in a constantly sociation
590.43,596.64, a constant diplomatic process of understanding and opening it about obviously respect
597.6,602.34, a creative region then the implies a certain practice
602.34,616.86, it implies a certain attitude or disposition towards those around you it implies in the case of migrants like myself taking ownership not only of places that we have come from reflecting on that
616.95,624.39, so understand something about the unseated ground where we find ourselves in the processes of affiliation
624.69,627.57, that need to be undertaken
627.66,640.02, in order to start a conversation where somewhere in that kind of fiction between indigenous and indigent australians are other voices also start to emerge
640.35,645.69, criterions than have all these characteristics i tried to to talk about that
645.78,648.39, and he brings his candors
648.84,652.53, who is james dawson but be failed to tell of sun
653.31,659.16, as dawson is to begin with a set of relationships
659.91,666.12, and probably one of the key relationships that we're trying to understand more about
666.24,669.39, his relationship with his daughter isabella
669.9,677.61, isabelle was born on the first station that they established in victoria on the far
677.73,680.73, and the late forties
681.15,688.08, a wealthier than the notes they made this extraordinary biblical migration with their cattle
688.2,692.43, down to a property that they took up
692.64,694.38, so
694.56,705.21, of the grampians where james dawson became an employer of indigenous shepherds indigenous stockman
705.21,706.98, indigenous
707.07,708.45, and workers
708.6,716.58, and also employed aboriginal women as domestic labour the
718.47,729.21, the finance legs for all those interactions those employments were kept for about seventy years and they would estropie
729.48,735.03, in itself it was remarkable that he insisted on written contracts for every single one of those
735.06,740.1, employed it's a village up speaking
743.1,746.31, as a prudent language
746.58,748.23, and
748.68,753.6, she was responsible for compiling over a long period between the bout
753.84,759.9, sixty two when she would have been i'm not sure but night or twenty
760.05,770.01, and a decade later when she published the result of her investigation into the local indigenous languages she was involved
770.13,779.79, as getting the language and these remarkable photographs of her sitting in the garden with the people that worked on the property discussing
779.82,786.3, the different languages and trying to get them so it was a classic colonial moment on level
786.54,790.59, as one deeper into the cabins that were collected
790.65,795.06, say that they are completely sabotaging what you would expect
795.24,806.73, to have happened from a scientific point of view the carved not attain to place a theory over what is being performed and recorded in dates day basis
806.82,815.4, rather go out of their way to record individual speech differences accents pronunciations and indeed to bring alive
815.49,828.66, a place of meeting or interaction in the way that completely sabotaged the great sort of grammatical probation of victorian science which is to reduce the language to order
828.81,840.87, so that's the first interesting relationship because james dawson oversights this and encourages it and eleven years after she published her first 
841.14,846.96, of the canaries he and she collaborated on the book called australian aborigines
847.23,859.41, remains by far the largest lexicon grammar and faciology or good it made and jallanges in existence
859.53,864.24, curse but the point is that it does not
864.39,867.21, in terms of a scientific inquiry
867.3,874.47, it's better to think of it is the diary of a set of conversations that were left unfinished
874.98,880.68, a second important relationship is with
881.04,885.36, a jailer who has various names
885.45,889.92, in one version he's called cologne
890.07,893.25, also called hissing pan is called king david
893.52,900.27, he becomes a close friend of dawson's and in fact there's an opera written about him which dawson commissioned
900.27,912.99, with pretty amazing and captains performing capitanata the anamall is still trying to track down the sheet music but it's there he becomes an extremely important collaborator
913.44,917.85, this project with all the ambiguity that collaboration had
918.06,925.38, in the way of the humor always in the way to the terrible events that happened on the convincing ground the portland
926.61,931.14, guys get together and they were very closely
931.26,937.62, understand between them not what was the past of indigenous culture
937.65,940.32, what it has to tell
940.35,954.54, largely the white city community and also the next generation of aboriginal people about the principles of a creative region a region that can be demonstrated to operate at every level
954.72,957.06, as an integrated
957.18,958.86, mechanism
958.95,960.99, taking care of country
961.32,972.75, really ask some quite remarkable articles that dawson publishes into the main stream journal at the argus on the australasian or where he will say sir i begged rootenant
972.87,975.87, to what
976.26,981.81, the original continuing possessors of this land say about the flies
982.47,988.5, for an indefinite exactly what they have to say about the flies and he knows
988.65,990.84, and
991.59,994.62, his workmen
994.86,995.79, not
995.94,1000.11, what's been told here is not his little bit of information about the stars
1000.2,1013.07, what has been told here is about the specific consolation in relation to a specific set of biota animals birds and the rising and falling of the plates corresponding to particular patterns of
1013.22,1015.71, lessing and migration and so forth
1016.43,1020.51, so these two relationships are important
1020.54,1028.31, but then there are also admiration or might say become very entangled so and isabella dosimeters
1029.12,1031.64, ragna
1031.76,1033.5, go
1033.56,1040.28, who takes on the james dawson emerges and that a quite you know quite a common process of doubling
1040.31,1045.62, as an indication of human merging attempt to try to work out some protocols
1045.77,1048.8, all accommodation between
1048.83,1052.64, an invasive culture one ateing too rationalize it
1054.23,1058.25, also he is defined by a set of interests which i mentioned before
1058.31,1079.55, of relationships and a set of interests and his relationships not only with his intimate community but also with the white human enlarge a fascinating if indigenous elders who co operate with him are collaborators in the ambiguous sense that always associate is alsacian with the native foreman
1079.73,1083.24, and has a similarly ambiguous relationship with
1083.27,1086.42, the policy makers
1086.45,1116.72, his good relationships with the vulgar of this world he commission on gerard anthill he also in remarkable moment yet one of his aboriginal stockmen to paint on gardening said that was his penteconters extended the primary there were issues about social justice he was a life long
1117.29,1120.35, his advocate
1120.56,1124.25, of humanitarian understanding
1124.55,1141.14, indigenous culture and what what a refuge had been caused by invasion he went out of his way as i indicated to try to bring to a broader audience but including an indigenous people
1141.14,1143.66, the fronts of what he had found out
1143.78,1149.93, the people who worked with him about a way of life about
1150.08,1154.73, practices about philosophical understanding above all about kinship
1154.76,1156.68, family practices
1157.25,1161.48, he did that not as ethnographer particularly but as a humanitarian
1161.87,1177.95, he did it in almost as a perfect exemplar of what carmack's wanted an integrated social producer to be other words he worked from his senses towards the sensuous understanding of his human environment
1178.13,1187.07, i think the republic critical thing is that he integrated his feeling of pain or suffering of pathos
1187.1,1191.93, into his knowledge since produced 
1191.96,1204.74, and the concert came back as ideas that functioned to make sense of the context of what was happening absolute historical understanding in contrast with the scientists who are around him
1204.83,1206.75, very keen to
1206.78,1215.66, a soul aboriginal people in the mission stations daughter a great enemy of mission station and hesitatingly going on about
1215.78,1224.0, how boring they won't have a nothing happened in these things and people who perfectly able to look after themselves or being treated by children as children
1224.33,1227.42, and he was very active in framlingham was very active
1227.57,1236.42, in going around basically victoria writing highly critical reviews what was happening in these places
1236.66,1242.12, trying to get better conditions even with him that sort of compromise situation
1242.42,1246.56, though what was interesting was that in that process
1246.68,1248.96, trying to
1250.64,1253.7, to his own feelings his own empathic
1253.88,1261.59, to make sense of his senses he managed to remain it seems
1261.59,1264.77, to connect all the different parts of his life
1264.83,1274.52, and i suppose the nutshell what doesn't happen when we have compartment like knowledge and is that connection between 
1276.65,1287.03, since making sense and concerts if you maintain that progression then feeling starts to generate a set of relationships between all the different fields
1287.15,1301.28, in fields enquiry they start to find an integrated to ethical understanding of the world and of course of practice it does not lead to what happened so frequently in scientific mode which his resentment
1302.21,1314.33, resentment is very much what happens when we impose a system as indeed people tried to do on the cooling nations language resentment set in when it didn't conform to a scientific model
1314.33,1327.77, they say the natives have a remarkably megapenthes his resentment to resentment against the very thing you thought you loved which was an example of scientific fragmentation he never went down that path
1328.28,1332.93, as a consequence of that he was able to integrate his passion
1332.99,1334.82, for human justice
1334.94,1337.97, equally strong passion for environmental conservation
1338.15,1350.75, he is responsible for commissioning mongering of tower hill which is many of you will know subsequently became a point of reference for vegetation and by diversity practices in that part of victoria
1351.11,1358.13, i was also responsible for establishing the mount rose with preternatural part version now rose
1358.31,1372.92, he was untiring in time through the columns of the newspapers fellow squatters how badly they were damaging the land telling about their fancy even undertook in depend experiment to look at colinton
1372.95,1378.35, in the western district and he was very adamant that 
1378.65,1397.25, ground water was receding as a result of bad practices all this stuffy did of his own bare i was merciless with his gun is to go around shooting everything he could see it stuffed himself taxidermy and the open the public museum in campeador the benefit of the public
1397.73,1405.71, so you know it wasn't wasn't just too good to be true he was also an animal activist
1406.34,1415.82, he led campaigns against cruelty animals very much and you know he would have been very much the forefront of what's happening with a live animal exports
1416.06,1421.67, he was continually advocating for protection particularly the cattle from cruel practices
1421.82,1426.47, above all he was committed to public education
1427.04,1430.16, committed to public education for his region
1431.3,1435.71, he didn't attempt to tell people what doing gives landorian
1435.74,1446.27, he radiated outward from his property he moved from the the far low western district at camperdown the foot by previous
1446.39,1452.87, proper sort of sort of tail and quite sure and quite what the financial situation was
1453.02,1456.44, it was a little bit like a second bankruptcy i think it was good for
1456.83,1458.48, dora
1458.6,1467.84, immunities or we all have and somewhere in there mark says that every time there is a
1467.99,1473.39, and economic change in one's life that produces a social revolution and it certainly did for
1473.54,1475.07, because
1475.31,1478.49, scotland and embark on this migrant career
1478.67,1487.58, so when he left canada which was the first property it caused him to come back to camperdown he was able to embark on these philanthropic activities
1488.75,1493.94, i want what we are finding is a man who is both a collaborator and a savage
1494.39,1499.46, he was on the one hand trying to make common cause
1499.58,1502.79, people that he did not pretend
1502.91,1507.71, to have a particular right to speak for
1507.8,1518.78, he thought of them as neighbours very much in the way he would have thought of neighbours in a scottish village he seemed to be tilted of the conventional social dominus racism
1519.14,1522.41, i just took the ass found them and what he found was
1522.59,1526.4, individuals who added up to a community
1526.55,1529.1, sally
1529.61,1536.96, came to regard as exemplary in the way they responded both to each other to the change of change
1537.23,1544.28, so his productive life there was a life that was an integrated relay between sense
1544.49,1545.96, concept
1546.08,1553.01, and bringing it back in a sensuous production and that's how he held together all these things i went to talk to him to
1553.85,1577.88, his great granddaughter the other day and she showed me the scrap book that survive and waisties down there with the therewithal museum but out on a white bandannas actually above the fire station i burnt down the ternary proud of his art he killed an artist or in scotland stuffed at the brown that was the core of his collection but
1577.97,1583.97, and he had quite a lot of stuff in there which we probably shouldn't enter he didn't know
1584.36,1588.38, people might think about it later than it will gottest
1588.8,1590.03, but
1590.18,1606.05, of those processes is a so he held together this common core of humanity as humanitarianism is somewhat in our post humanist environment is somewhat disregarded but his capacity to be a common
1606.08,1622.1, human being to hold together all these different interests without some irritable desire to understand and possess and control but rather to create through his work and his catullus rates it and incredible miscellany of related interests
1622.58,1625.64, a literary style as well the style of the missel
1625.7,1629.09, who works from local instances which touch him
1629.42,1642.17, then starts to produce concepts at on those concepts starts to produce social change and as i say he toddling artists is commissioning opera writers
1642.26,1648.77, he commissions and extraordinary monument to one of his indigenous friends
1648.8,1651.98, now the district when this man died
1652.19,1653.66, doris
1653.9,1658.7, upset by the district of respect paid to his remains
1658.91,1660.71, put up his immense obelisk
1660.71,1670.19, outside capadose monument his tireless to try to hold these things together that a falling apart all around him
1670.64,1678.59, so what is there what it is this thing this creative region then when it's put through how i have thirteen
1679.79,1680.87, second
1681.56,1684.29, fanchon you but
1684.59,1688.28, what is this thing that he is producing
1688.28,1694.91, in relation to that creative region when it sort of channeled through the individual life of this man
1695.39,1705.71, i think what he's doing is his producing a distinctive form place based margiana which is its situation
1706.04,1714.38, again it is exemplary in terms of its responsiveness to at the engagements
1714.41,1717.38, that he find on his daughter
1717.86,1736.55, he responds openly he responds passionately and constructively to the evident human injustices and more broadly and the senses of destruction he sees all around him so he's both highly progressive his highly reaction
1737.27,1744.5, progressive in the sense he foresees the destruction that happening and he remembers it from what he's been told
1744.77,1748.7, this also reactionary because he wants to arrest
1749.21,1756.5, the rights of destruction so in terms of the climate climate change debates he both want to
1756.74,1759.68, find accommodation with change
1759.71,1762.65, he also wants to mitigate
1762.68,1774.83, if you like is that a double edge so he both once public education to encourage again very marienbourg a leisure which is socially productive
1775.01,1777.62, same time he cries out
1777.77,1786.47, against the waste the sheer waste of human potential and also for the disregard of the spirit lives
1786.5,1789.23, of non human nature as well
1790.85,1798.26, situation in knowledge and as i say produces is incredibly animated scene of interconnected interests
1799.61,1812.54, behind it and within it and threw it is the unspoken un understood so far relationship between him and isabella who is at the dark heart of this whole original knowledge is to her
1812.72,1838.7, and the fascinations of the gendering of the knowledge that the canaille through her or discussions with the children that were now female adults that she grown up with the comether part that too and we will probably need other people to help us to understand how that all words the second thing that was very important brings me to the sub title of the talk is that situation or knowledge or place based ledge
1838.79,1841.58, is essentially of the capacity to speak the place
1842.0,1849.08, the real burden of this for cavalry was not to classify to reduce and produce something to be taken away and spoken in
1849.08,1852.38, an it was all to show
1852.5,1857.45, this the people who were contributing
1857.45,1862.91, nouns and adjectives and verbs had an endless
1864.08,1872.66, it would just it would go on so long as the conversation my dawn it would continue to exfoliate produce more nuances and more possibilities
1872.69,1879.53, so he makes a great point arsinoe in the publication that in contrast with the
1879.65,1885.08, the maps which have so few names and then all the names as sooner
1885.23,1888.65, the indigenous people of that region had names represent
1888.86,1895.25, it wasn't they couldn't testify the new arteries when it was necessary but generally speaking they also had a name for when a rivederlo
1895.94,1899.39, well as names or individual bellarminius
1899.42,1911.0, rocks as was necessary was it that they just charted the place and necessarily they charged it functionally that's to say they make connections that function
1911.33,1923.33, he's making that point in the we understand perhaps the importance of the old to speak to be a tenant bring the place into being through names i hope we do
1923.51,1927.14, he understood speaking the place as the key
1927.35,1940.1, on the key to be in to live there and more important than that the key to be able to produce the place so it was at about this putting upon your gate post and aboriginal words saying o my insurance
1940.37,1943.61, and thinking therefore the major you know trastevere
1943.64,1944.99, nothing like that
1944.99,1947.09, that the case of water
1947.39,1967.67, oh for some inexplicable reason he knew personally well when he made his second homestead outside camperdown indigenous words were for habitation village you over the stone huts sorest of it he understood partly well or that but what he chose to do instead so using the word he used water
1968.03,1984.5, would is the word you find on jamaica or that word on the end that which essentially means liphalet uplifters and but why would he call his house on his on his face is it or
1984.62,1986.51, as
1987.17,2003.55, why would he call the place where he came to live at the time that he was working on me on austrians on the cavalry and page for care in three different dialects that together with grammatically call the place where he worked and lived
2004.78,2007.12, and it appears that he called it lit
2007.3,2010.27, he was well aware that it was a word
2010.3,2013.66, in these languages that also referred to flowing
2014.08,2018.52, also report referred to the lip of a water hole
2018.55,2025.15, referred to were in the river it referred to a place of fluid change
2025.3,2028.09, a place where something was expressed
2028.24,2032.56, where therefore something fell out was collected and moved forward
2032.77,2036.01, so that what one may be missus my speculation
2036.37,2043.96, had something in his mind to do with the relationship with the talking place and a place where
2044.2,2047.56, essential element for life is better bring out
2047.71,2049.57, were poured
2049.63,2057.52, but what was called there was not simply a neological relationship what was pulled there were connections that functioned
2057.82,2063.25, between living in social production between the intimate act
2063.46,2065.08, speaking and listening
2065.29,2067.51, inclining and
2067.72,2069.13, relying
2070.24,2072.13, connections that functioned
2072.31,2073.57, so
2074.65,2080.41, i want to do this morning in the context of this imposing
2080.44,2090.79, certainly free range that it really come from any particular discourse they bring together little bits and pieces of nineteenth century history little bits and pieces of local history
2090.91,2095.59, some reflection of the poetics of place making what i wanted to bring to you to day
2096.13,2099.49, was the thought that in addition
2099.88,2105.34, the social and political mechanisms we need in order to improve
2106.09,2108.43, payderson
2108.67,2111.52, about the future of our environment
2111.73,2119.98, the various means of collaboration that we've heard about it also involves remembering people who have already shown us the way
2120.79,2122.89, ornamentation
2123.16,2125.47, he exempted because he wasn't a scientist
2125.74,2130.24, it wasn't an artist he wasn't even in a certain sense an intellectual
2130.84,2133.9, he was was a sensuous
2133.9,2135.43, of the real
2135.88,2142.48, to him there was no difference between being socially and producing
2142.96,2144.7, well in which
2145.84,2147.64, this made sense
2148.33,2166.81, that was his primary task to make sense of the watermelon it made silicious it was running which casey shot him with that with his but provided it with is it one lay still and pale but indeed but the point of that too when he when he went out hunting it was not for the gratification of the kill
2166.9,2168.73, as to public education
2168.76,2178.27, actually part of its conservation policy if they could have you know museums and stuffed animals in the major cities of the world why shouldn't they have one in camped
2178.48,2183.04, to perform operations why couldn't they do it in campden
2183.1,2198.01, it was a great dravel sense of italian sacermento these lines he really believed in his own so church tower basically so i recommend him to you as a contribution to thinking about a crater region
2198.04,2199.48, we have here
2199.57,2204.34, reminder that there are particular and advertise a particular people
2204.43,2206.98, and spirits were very strong
2207.1,2213.31, one of our tasks is in terms of inventing that a future is to remember that
