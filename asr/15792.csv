242.4,245.16, concerns us is that we know that
245.67,249.84, her body and our child to be thus it was growing in her body
249.84,254.58, grouped this cocktail of synthetic chemistry swirling
254.61,256.83, around her body she was developing
257.13,260.37, a sort of angers us in sad and as
261.66,265.14, born and in the twenty first century
265.17,269.67, wanting talking experiment of synthetic chemistry thousand vented
269.76,271.14, a century
271.38,272.43, that's what
274.92,277.68, deeply wrong delamore

308.7,311.76, since
311.85,324.69, ah here's a japanese man scientists doctor shooter he's well known for studying how plastic pellets absorb different talons
324.81,328.53, the program called international peach
328.95,335.22, and if you find liassic pellets on your beach anywhere in the world hawaii or timbuctoo or eastland
335.25,338.73, those pots to him neither kind of talk and draw those pellets
339.27,346.92, and he suffered for an hour and i cast his face and i asked the guide to smile and that his smile right there
347.85,350.28, this painful
350.52,352.23, smile
358.86,363.45, this part of the river i mean i'm looking for plastic that sink
363.75,375.21, so sylvia are first woman to walk ashore those pigs for come i know deepwaters which she told us was that she had seen his massive increase
375.24,388.14, trash in ocean floor we wasn't there years ago and half a century were littered the entire planet the piece
388.5,392.22, ethereally the kind of class tootsies
392.4,400.68, the classis country is negatively point and you'll find it littering the ocean floor getting there there are rivers
402.21,407.34, the sonata
408.63,411.57, for soliman
413.04,414.72, i hope for your help
414.99,422.61, to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and in so doing
422.88,424.26, secure hope
424.35,425.82, human kind
425.88,427.62, to the ocean means
427.68,434.85, for us as at a short you really cherish no
434.85,439.65, this expendable when i started to explore the ocean
440.01,442.32, any plastic to think about it
444.99,447.42, the prestige
447.42,448.38, now
448.41,454.05, retourner a few plastics few knobs on
454.32,457.77, things like that but now we're just rounding it
458.94,460.59, come forward a little bit
464.31,466.89, i feel
468.03,470.46, reason
470.49,477.54, he 
477.9,478.59, he
487.38,493.53, yes i care if he is your lips takes
495.42,504.12, it is its prey
504.96,515.37, woodwender plastic to be durable
515.37,518.79, distant to cold and heat
518.85,522.24, within make products that we throw away
522.33,543.78, at this amazing material and that kind of mentality would not thinking of a good recovery plan has resulted in all these animals around the world no not just one bird its six hundred sixty three species to date we have documented interacting with our trash
544.32,566.91, i don't think that the microbes that corporations necessarily do about the impact of those microbes would have i don't think that they you know when it turns at these are going to go in the water who cares it's not common right now incorporate culture to be doing lifecycle assessment but i think we need to change that and request
566.94,578.19, that we think about alforgas something what is that man down the line and we really need to change what is currently a one way path from extraction to disposal
578.82,580.38, work in metre
580.44,581.88, once
582.06,589.68, you know and so our society organises tinsels also has to start working on cycles
597.84,602.88, the
610.98,617.85, he 
618.6,642.69, he aesofoedita was
645.78,646.8, half a pint
647.43,650.64, how you know that much bottle of his had that much weight
650.97,657.21, we cyclers they'll pick up bottles because that hasn't enough way that's worth the effort to pick it up
657.3,660.81, it place and the process of recycling
661.02,662.49, not at all
662.7,666.57, you took a whole class by melted the down it might be less than
666.72,672.33, one tenth of this when i talked to waste vickers actually disguise here in armenia
672.39,680.43, even he that lives in a home made shock with his entire family living off the money gets reposing potswood not
680.49,684.51, as bad as to why don't you pick up plassans
684.99,687.69, he said well you know one person bag is dirty
688.29,690.69, one pinch of sand in a bag
690.75,692.64, the bag now double its weight
693.15,698.34, no buyer is in a by dirty passing from me to think i'm princeton
698.82,702.3, i can't risk that to aim bottles either
702.63,709.47, no one touches contadini even though the waste because of india will not pick up passavans so
709.47,711.6, the great example of
711.72,715.71, design matters i would call this mad not a wastepaper
715.89,729.15, but his station engineer i mean he could tell me more about design that i can the sidenote he does what recover you mean economics in his world matter
730.89,740.37, amusing people here to put my toe is the kind of plastic that sinks so the earth or tutor of classic was that sinks
740.58,745.8, floreated toupette right time so meaning
746.04,746.91, it's
747.39,750.96, to the pine the subject and the material
751.26,752.91, i had had
803.28,807.6, he
833.31,839.28, he 
857.28,862.83, he 
864.63,869.07, i 
886.56,891.48, we 
897.66,898.5, he
