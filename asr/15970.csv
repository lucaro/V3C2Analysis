0.9,39.24, the tearers market is on if you want to catch the last hour or so and enjoy the wonderful fresh produce and prepared foods that are available right there and then in fact coming up in a few minutes will be talking about some some of those very products that are unsalaried noticed a couple of years ago a new law came in allowing a home kitchens to proceed for sale an then in a commercial kitchen so i'll be speaking with juliet vaselin from the use propension
39.24,54.57, and she is a foot systems adviser i think is that correct sertularia narayan so we'll be finding out about this law and how it doing what its impact and things like that
54.84,111.33, and then about half way through she johnson will be calling and she is with seaweed and savory cobblers they make curtaining and coplen someone else but anyway she makes wonderful pies and she's going to be telling us experience of being a license or cottage food operate as so seloufeeat an idea from a couple of sides but held this is working my guest or to night only a ventilating hole by and thank you so much for coming in all the way to the studio here and enjoying a bit of the occidental flavor very happy to be here thinking for having me great and as it's the market occidental market
111.6,542.28, from a market to night your work is really with the cottage food operations it's a new thing on started a couple of years ago maybe in tell us about where it started and why we're doing it cheap to cottages are the result of a new california law it was a b sixteen sixty or the california homemade food act and it went into law in january twenty thirteen and soongoora in your home kitchen and prepare them in your home kitchen and then sell them to the public which up until this lock that wasn't possible in california had to be in a commercial kitchen license kitchen falderal license kitchen which met that discovering able to start a foot business had to be a little larger and a little bit more complex and costly so this new law went into effect and allows people to make food in their home kitchen and its only specific food so what they call potentially non hazardous foods in other words shall stable foods that don't need refrigeration and within that list of the shelf staple foods there's a very specific list of approved foods for california cottage food operations but this is a state law was socratically levels each one now in the environmental health department has charge of helping local cottage food operators become registered or permitted to be able to operate cottage food businesses in home kitchens and there also in charge with donnacona operation and also originated laestrygones an attention to creating a local food economy and to enable people to manufacture food locally to grow and produce own food and so this law was really inspired out of that movement across california the similar cottage food laws in other states and so this particular one had a gloire local economic development to help improve access to healthy food and reduce childhood obesity and to spur local micro businesses that can then grow and scale up into other kinds of food businesses using commercial kitchens of the next salesresistance of the movement to get this line to place whereas a particular person who made french bread in his home kitchen and was having a really successful french bread company and then got shot down because it wasn't in compliance with the local regulations and people saw that as a real bad situation because it was a very successful business a delicious product contributing to the local food economy and really wanted to see a way to make businesses like that possible and so that story i'm sure was repeated throughout the state and different scenarios and now this law enables many of those people to make these products at their home to start a small business and testators or really see what works for them in their family and their business idealities class a permit for a registration and class by permit said the class a is a hundred and thirty nine dollars per year and the class be permit is three hundred forty seven dollars per year so in that way the entry cast in a row to get the registration or the permit is fairly a fordable and the business the cottage food operation according to the letter of the law is allowed to make a gross revenue of a tifft thousand dollars a year so there is ultimately a cat if the business is hugely wildly successful than that's really an indication that they've outgrown this particular law and are ready to scale up to the next set of opportunities in a commercial kitchen only letting it interest transition tattheration space craft and better operating and homeness as he truly saying in our you're making millions of dollars had of your home kitchen may be these isn't set up for that maybe your dry way in your home street is not set up for that level of economics and business operations and so these are really for microbes based out of the home and then up to fifty thousand dollars grospierre of public health and its informal at the environmental health department in the county of sinoma and so it doesn't trump or supersede the regulations like having a business life in or following the local land use codes that are applicable to wear over the home is pertipole have insurance and active website proper tools and so the slidestairs practices for local businesses its 
542.67,587.52, but in half a sinlessly it there's a lot of people over doing it or want to do it how's the outreach for that how you getting to people yea so the state passed the flat didn't provide a lot of funding for educating the general public about the new law or for having the county educate their local population about the new law and so that's actually brings me to how i became involved in an interested in cottage food i helped run a training series across california through you scarification to train a small scale woodbines is in the cottage food
587.82,930.12, and the opportunity we train them in business practice as well as in foaty and so that was a wonderful start for getting a whole range of people across california trained and ready for cottage food operations in addition there's a number of really helpful website and other educational information on line and then each county has all of the necessary information in terms of how to apply what can be expected from being a cottage food operation frequently asked questions and so there's a lot of information on mine but i would say that generally the public hasn't isn't well aware and knowledgeable about this new opportunity because it still still fresh and still a little unknown and misunderstood as well muesilochus be something in basically to join him i think the most impotent thing strange food operations that now have been in business for a year or two even up to two and a half years start spreading the word about what's work for them what were their challenges for did they run into any obstacles that were expected and how did they overcome those obstacles so i'm really excited that will have another guest joining us little later current cottage food operator so we can learn from her the kind of experiences she is face as a cottage food operator i can say one challenge that very common is that the list of foods that are cottage food approved for this state of california is fairly restrictive and so not every product that someone might want to make in their home kitchen for sale is included in that list saith the class i am crosby is that the alien and i can get into that and just a moment in terms of the list of approved food though at that a list that the state made that are based on what they call non potentially hazardous food so the shelf stable foods so what that means is that there can't be any dairy products like cream filling or custards because it would need refrigeration there can't be any meat products or fresh fruits or vegetables that are rocketing has to be cooked and process or dried in some kind of way in which it shall stable and doesn't need refrigeration just as an example a very popular food item right now are pickles and sour crowds and fermented food that's a huge trend locally and nationally as well and this particular law unfortunately doesn't cover fermented food be away do require furiation and redeemed a little bit more risky than these shall say stable food that are on the approved listener a little bit unfortunate in terms of limiting the breadth and depth of this law and allowing local food businesses smotheration within six months to a year that it got a little longer beanpole comment and demand and so hopefully with time that list will become more and more expansive but ultimately because of the context that the food businesses are operating in home kitchens there still going to be some kind of cautious restriction to insure that public health estuarine person to get it on the list statisticians uneasiness come to mind apparently papoose on the first of the provision they seemed very safety low risk outher shelf table apparently enough people love popcorn balls and up and advocated for these that i got up put on the profesti don't remember the exact order of what went on the list and how it grew but i think another example of seasoning salts so you know salts that you had maybe add to a meal or a marinade something in her finishing salts are very popular right now and they were on the list but their very safe a little bit of herbs combined with salt and mister those were recently at encountering within the county what they approve of donore all the processes peartest level so the county can't
930.15,991.23, make that more expansive or more restrictive for that matter i'm what they can do as they can help support these local food businesses by decreasing the cost of the registration or the permit or if they're not hugely supportive or art don't have the workforce within the county to support this kind of development than other counties may choose to make that more expensive ootcast of the perimeter registration of that county by county and a soft and a bit indication of the counties goals in this area if it's very expensive or less expensive and noaccount a very typical range compared to other counties there some that are close to a thousand dollars to get puritan there some counties that are free so it really does range and here amanyensis
991.41,1064.79, how did you get into this line of work what's your background and inspiration to her to reach this as you mention i am food system adviser with you see cooperative station so i work for the university of california but i am base here locally and someone and the north bay to help connectives of california with our local community so in my role as a fit systems adviser i help connect local farmers with local consumers and help increase access to fresh locally grown food and a really interested in the food system as a whole from far to fork and everything in between so that's how i got inspired and interested in cottage foods as a way to help local farmers be more economically viable and as a way to support the development of our local food economy attestation cottage food and
1064.82,1181.19, more broadly the development of the local food system is happening right here before her eyes in the evening where red around the corner from the farmers market and that's a wonderful example of the local food system thriving and being very vibrant so my role in cooperative extension is to support that and to help build and posteritas well as to research it and share best practices with the community theater training team across the university of california and the lead researchers named doctor sherman hardesty and cheese with you see tevis and she led a group of cooperative extension advisers and other consultants to put on a training serious across california to help inspire and get ready for business in new or potential cottage food operators a result of that training series is a website that is live and holds all of the training materials that we created and that can be accessories slash cottage foods or just by google angus arcot foods and it'll be the top hit and so that website is up and live with aleurites and then after that initial grand that funded all of that work are very happy to continue with a training series if theirs continued demanded interest on the part of the public and so i think that guy every one started in the right direction and then i am sure will antonine it going down the road as new business is good inspired to try the soul
1181.22,1306.74, it is the law so if people don't comply with the law obviously theirs usually pelletan things like that what is the dark side of the law so i haven't heard of any dark side yet this surfacing sabotage relief that largely overwhelmingly lila has been marry successful so in the case of a cottage food operation being out of compliance missive hypothetical because i haven't heard very many people running into this scenario but the sassoon did get sick or even of the item that they purchase wasn't to their expectations they could potentially file a complaint with the department of enlargement health then the county would investigate that so they might make a home inspection or test the tastes the product olinto it but it would be really based on a reactionary a complete and not necessarily out in forcing the lancaster had a small team to do this and luckily like i said there haven't been any problems that i am aware of i think people have been really thrilled with the opportunity and it spiewell ingly successful here insinuated across california i should in a moment returned back to the difference between the classes and the class besprent between the class a and the caspian involves a homespun by the environmental health department so they actually injured the home and check out the kitchen and the other one is the self certification process so there's a level of hands on in annandale bit more ironstone food operator to self certify and say that this is the stealthy practices so going back to your questions about the issue of isolation in compliance it would be more
1307.04,1316.13, obvious in a class be permit than in a class a permit the other difference between 
1316.25,1528.8, to what still comply but have a great einstein and accountability to the other aspect that's really important to note between those two is that the class a registration it only allows direct sails so what i mean by that is i as a cottage food operator make the food and then i give it directly to you you pay me i hand you the product and we have a face to face exchange in person that can be at my home kitchen it could be here at the farmer's market could be at a local fair but mwesa other and we directly exchange the money for the product of the inn a class be permit that a permanent of the first one's a registration in the class by permit it allows indirect sales so i make the food in my home kitchen i sell it to a restaurant and then the restaurant self it to you said there's an indirect change there in the money and the product or i make it in my home kitchen i sell it to a grocery store and then you go to the grocery store and by it there tonthormid of his class or classes sophisticated wallenstein was maintainable makes a difference monstrosities that i really love buttonholed and make sure your stories
1528.92,1550.28, amazing you really learn a lot if you're in the food world you know you know that chataways solon as question what the courts with the food safety course they sure that during the process during the cassatts never a problem the back track she wanted to measure that you could see it i just couldn't believe
1550.46,1566.36, it wasn't more known about you know i have been following the loiseaus i was thinking of it genesmere heavier will this be in the ability for me in sunshine signed the bill and
1566.51,1568.25, we are today
1568.25,1603.8, i think it's a great thing you know i also take primordial local venders shofar was really there in portion of the first arms to release support me and if it wasn't for them if it wasn't for any to there were really the ones who tell me he is to do this this is something that we're interested in annoyance that you know how do you feel about getting starlike i might i just want to make sure you guys are ready for me but it's been amazing but my son lord of support and from all all the branches that you have to deal with
1604.16,1605.36, all
1605.45,1700.28, really make it easy that sounds good to me now it's a wonderful story to hear i'm so glad glad to hear that it's been a positive experience so i'm curious if you could give a little bit of background when you were a cottage food operator before you scaled up to this next level it sounds like you were a class be operator in that you could sell indirectly to andy's produce or temperas other markets of that practitioner of graduate affections why i felt the positive even venturing into the cottage footwork of course we had to do we ended up with amazing business at plans as graduate and one of the first things that i wanted to focus on look like you know making sure that i'm doing everything correctly i had an opportunity to work with when i was young and self employed to advocate to make sure i was directly you are only started a business letter from scratch and literary friend and family a lot and my notice shenstone's
1700.28,1762.95, your home i remember thinking man this is you know because i'm seances i had to wait to introduce the savory collar but making season and having an opportunity to you know work with local vendors on the season of fruit was amazing i mean it just kind of went hand in hand with each other yes so i think that's really a subtle difference the sweet and the savoury cottagers and i wondering if you can for the listeners and a little bit more in terms of the sweet cobblers and those why those were allowed and anooroudha 
1763.13,1768.98, people normally no copper as to do not so much on the favors
1769.37,1796.91, the reason why there's a difference not only and to why you're not allowed to prepare these things out of your home is because of the risk factor of the meat of the dairy that adown it mean people scintillation
1797.06,1807.08, let there are so many more products useable now under the college my girlfriend was just talking doing am i said i think that's richenda
1807.41,1824.33, definitely an opportunity for us but we need to look into a look into the licensing and in your county i was explaining to the that i just moved to lake comes as a back up i think i might even look into working with our community center as well as saying remaining in repartee
1824.33,1913.76, that's where i found it that where i started the beautiful in such a wonderful positive thing experience for footer sometimes it can be a bit difficult having the government come in in operations on hesitating to knock and forth with you to make sure that you're on the same case beatissima walk into the health department and you get the factionaries looking that we would be free and it was amazing like my life ningwinnena monthly made it easy and i really appreciated that specially not knowing if the business was going to be a success however thing was fundamento funding until you know i precedent where i get work out of my home any more you know it was amazing it was just alliteratively making that lead to commercial size halitherses
1913.85,1941.48, in a year i think i was tapping on my door with the like mother in six months after i started so you know it's like okayondonghsera appreciate her trying to do and ortheris
1941.75,1995.21, cooking home you know not on had a huge garden and weary saturday the sick from the garden into had an orchard we were blessed in that sense but my mom would always take the series make sunday dinner and my favorite is here was completing her watching her pictures you know going to three different stores for product it was just amazing i really fell in love making and then of course my dad's car transcendentalism was in heritage the family an you took yourself took asiaticum back to it
1995.27,2075.43, absolutely i think things lined up for a reason i'm just glad that i'm able to pursue my passion now that i have related to a county i'm working with a lot of the pair interfered i continue to be if to work with a lot of the local benthamism butter with i mean it's just like walking into a family on business he still so welcome and that's what i love about our county obstetrical whose experience shall i've had it was not without its calendar own pocket book after my first sheet he i had to see financing and i turned to working solutions of a samosata and again the woman's initiative became the bond unfortunately frater i graduated so you know one of the guarantees was that they would be able to help bundesrat your business is to unsanctioned
2075.76,2322.81, left me and it was amazing it was on the fight unbelievable blessing for sure ebba tiful and i mean julia you've had some more those results you've heard from he had secession like a wonderful success and i'm very pleased to hear that it sounds like you had just the right resources of the right time to send it also i really love the story you were telling about how this business got inspired from your own home and your own family traditions it made me reflect back on to emelie detail about the law that allows people to employ their own family members in the air and so i mean i have planned for all my younger generation teetotallers other employes down the road your buying from local farmers incarceration that postulate ripples out into the broader community so this is a really wonderful example that way toleration without a pie but to chat with me foreordaining in my plea to have a night guanacos wonderful to have a shore along and to see that side of the law working yes so as wonderful to hear from a share she clearly had a very positive wonderful supportive experience which is such a nice story to hear i know that other people sometimes run into red blocks whether that the cost of a permit or registration when there a little business and cabineted their idea yet so they might not be willing to take that leap or whether it's that they're not cut assure what kind of business in liability insurance they should get or how to build a website what have you many people experience a bump along the road and so i really encouraged folks to the
2322.84,2333.16, tell and given a try but also to go with a persistence and a little bit of caution because it's
2333.31,2465.61, not always as smooth ease experience and i am sure she wasn't telling us all the little challengeable cause i'm sure they were there is the more so people if you want to do that type of business people will have to do that to comply requirements of the law are very straightforward and clearly laid out on the tobacco environmental health website and again congested look up cottage food law for california and go directly to sonoma county in order to find the permit or the registration in order to apply but those petals are very very clear it's more the broader details like sherry mentioned having a business plan which is a really wonderful thing if you're planning to start a food business but not every one starts with the business plans that something that i would recommend that machinations was posturing on a really solid foundation and i think this that people often come to a cottage from food operation from one perspective or the other one they might want to be a small business owner and then they try out recipes that will help them beat that gold or two they might have recipes that their family and prince absolutely love and say you got to turn this into a business and said then they start with the recipe and they turn that into a business and i think people approach cottage foods from either direction notably
2465.64,2592.84, and registered in the county there's a little over forty cottage food operators so clearly it's a popular and that's working well but there's a huge room for growth and so i think of the plasterer she that people right now are making a wonderful business or primary business out of this opportunity but with more of this information being sharpers can pop up over time intolerable and really have a good thing going absolutely beautiful thank you julie julie vanland and what an interesting thing this is cottage food operations and weepeth and i want to see what's happening and will keep any new development in it as well aphthartodocetism italian
