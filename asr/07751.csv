328.26,332.58, our representatives in bringing peace
333.69,340.05, homeless to this world through jesus christ our lord
340.29,342.09, thus to pray saying
342.21,353.34, other garden heaven oleanders
353.64,361.53, eaton
361.83,366.9, he 
367.05,372.54, no
375.57,412.92, he tolerated
413.58,443.85, i toasted
447.09,462.72, the story that we look at in scripture to day i think is one that needs to be put in context and sometimes this particular story we isolate and don't take time to notice what happened immediately before
462.78,473.4, a story of jesus walking on the water and coming to the disciples in the middle of the lake in the early hours of the morning
473.7,496.14, it is important to put that in a certain context because you see this story begins in the evening of the same day that jesus has learned of the death of his beloved friend and cousin john the baptist jesus needed to be by himself he needed to grieve
496.32,514.26, you see there was a crowd of people who were hungry for the teaching that he had to bring and they were also hungry for bread and fish that story perhaps remember and have heard it another time
514.44,524.46, i think it's important to remember that jesus desperately wanting to be by himself and simply pray to god
524.79,526.83, was forced
527.43,574.14, the needs of the crowd and by his love for these people to put off his own needs and wait until a little bit later to be by himself and to pray so jesus has been through all of that at the end of the day and we take up the reading of matthew chapter fourteen first twenty two to thirty three and this is again is immediately after the feeding of the five thousand immediately jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the crowds and after he had dismissed the crowds he went up the mountain by himself to pray
574.14,600.96, evening came he was there alone but by this time the boat battered by the waves was far from the land for the wind was against them and early in the morning jesus came walking toward them on the sea when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear
601.17,605.28, immediately she spoke to them and said
605.61,618.63, it is i do not be afraid and peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
618.9,631.74, jesus said come so peter got out of the boat started walking on the water and came toward jesus
632.37,642.27, but when he noticed the strong wind he became frightened and beginning to sink he cried out lord save me
642.57,650.13, jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him saying to him you of little faith
650.16,652.5, why did you doubt
652.5,660.78, when they got into the boat the wind ceased and those in the boat worshipped him
660.9,665.52, saying truly you are the son of god
665.88,671.46, may god bless to our hearts and our understanding this reading from god's holy word
671.76,672.96, and
673.47,688.5, many interesting and some funny things to notice in this passage scripture and i think the first thing we want to notice as we see the disciples in a vote in trouble fighting against the wind and the waves of the lake
688.92,691.74, disciples were in trouble
691.83,718.08, and they were doing exactly what jesus had told them to do they were obeying the lord's command he had told them to get in the boat and to go across to the other side they were doing exactly what jesus told him to do and then they found themselves in trouble sometimes to day faithful people have exactly the same problem
718.11,724.32, somehow for people to faith it makes sense to think while we get in trouble when we don't do what god wants
724.62,742.92, actually sometimes we get in trouble precisely because we are doing what god was because we live in a world that is sometimes a bit hostile to doing the things that god wants at least the way we christians understand them
742.95,751.41, and so the disciples were in trouble even as they obeyed the command of christ
751.5,757.83, the early church looked back on this event and this story with
758.07,766.2, they needed this story because in the early years the church was greatly persecuted
766.26,778.38, they look back on this story and they see that jesus comes to them jesus comes to them first of all when he was needed most
778.5,792.45, secondly he comes in a way that no one expects third at least in this one instance he has come in a way that everybody knows is impossible
792.9,796.62, and yet he did it anyway
798.18,817.14, the disciples did not recognize jesus and it was important it was necessary for jesus to identify himself and he says it is i and then peter peter says lord if it is you bid me to come
817.56,820.29, no i'm sorry but that was just plain dumb
820.38,840.66, my daughter when she was nine reading i'm not sure if it was this passage scripture or another he commented that it seemed like peter was always doing something dumb now if you or i saw some one walking on the water doing what was totally impossible to do
840.69,863.79, heard the voice of jesus identifying himself would you say lord if it is you and what further confirmation the other disciples in the boat didn't do that i don't think i would do that i suspect you would not either but as my daughter said it seems like peters always doing something dumb
864.81,867.87, lord says come
868.77,872.19, peter gets out of the boat
873.18,878.13, maybe that's doing something dumb as well would you do that
878.34,894.36, i don't think i would the other eleven certainly did not do that it seemed pretty stupid at the time men they were in a perfectly good boat and it was a pretty bad storm we sometimes use the phrase look before you leap
894.6,902.88, well peter was never very good at doing that and so peter stepped over the side of the boat
903.03,916.32, the other eleven far more sensible far more careful may be a little smarter they did not get in trouble that night the way foolish impulsive peter did
917.46,921.54, so here is peter walking on the water
921.57,925.95, wonder what he was thinking was he scared
926.01,934.32, excited was he proud of himself was he happy i don't know
934.71,947.31, first he says he saw the wind or the translation we read just now he noticed the wind he noticed the wind and was frightened
947.76,958.68, i have heard some bible commentators suggest that seeing the wind is the same thing as saying that he took his eyes off of jesus
959.37,967.17, and that of course was when he got in trouble that was when he failed that was when he sank
967.26,971.1, cried out for help lord save me
971.49,978.57, of course that is also when the word reached out and took him by the hand and did save him
979.38,996.63, the opera was pretty foolish that day he was too quick to jump he was unprepared he was not ready he tried to do what was absolutely impossible everybody knew it was impossible and he failed
997.14,1004.73, and the other eleven they were just too wise for all of that they would never do such a foolish way
1005.42,1014.48, i'm afraid i must confess that i would not do such a thing either i invite you to examine yourself for a moment
1014.87,1019.31, you think you would have jumped out of that boat that day
1019.94,1039.29, but then there is this imagine how many times in history twelve people have been in a boat and had trouble with the wind and the waves have stayed in their perfectly good safe boat and afterwards made it safely back to shore
1039.35,1062.63, how many times do you think that is happened millions of times that has happened in history but nobody writes stories about that do then matthew would not have included the story in his version of the gospel if it had happened that day there wasn't anything important to report
1062.81,1067.46, that was the way the story went down
1067.52,1074.27, even our people stay in a boat who cares big deal that's not a story
1074.54,1077.06, so here's the real question
1077.15,1082.31, who had the war worth while experience that day
1082.43,1085.37, or the eleven
1085.46,1108.8, learned the most that he who actually did something that day that no one has ever done before or since who accomplished something that day that we all know is totally and completely impossible even if he only did it for three or four steps
1109.46,1110.81, as peter
1110.87,1112.76, it wasn't the eleven
1112.76,1115.73, we i know
1115.94,1121.1, refer to be like the safe careful he left
1121.4,1143.39, we don't want to risk too much and this is true whether i am talking about myself and my family or whether i am talking about the church we want to be sensible and wise we don't want to take too much risk we're not going to jump over the side of the boat why we make jokes about being uncomfortable when people rock the boat
1143.57,1146.51, going to step over the side of the boat
1146.6,1153.2, so i guess the story of peter is a story of risk and of courage
1153.59,1170.99, also a story of hope i think it is above all a story of hope i think the entire message of the gospel in the new testament is above all a story of hope it is about following christ
1171.2,1175.76, and somehow with christ's power and strain
1176.03,1178.19, then doing something
1178.28,1180.95, seemed not possible
1181.31,1199.7, so it's on hope that i focus now as we close the story to day the story of peter walking on water is a story of hope and it is also not only peter's story
1199.73,1212.24, it is the church's story it is your story and i it is the story that belongs to the church of our time and place
1212.24,1219.83, it's the story of hope for disciples but it is a story of hope for all of us
1219.95,1247.1, whenever we look at a job that seems too great whenever we look at tasks that seem too difficult whenever we look at world problems that seem impossible we see racial hatred we see other kinds of bigotry and prejudice we see greed we see poverty we see war we see horrible illness in the world
1247.13,1252.11, all of these things that have been part of human history
1252.17,1253.79, ever
1253.97,1257.21, and it seems like they always will be
1257.75,1260.78, makes it hard for us to hope
1261.53,1270.41, sometimes we are like the eleven in the boat we want to stay where it is safe and quiet
1271.49,1280.01, don't want to jump out of the boat sometimes when we are faced with problems that seem impossible
1280.07,1286.25, let us remember that governments do not have the capability
1286.28,1288.38, stepping out of the boat
1288.56,1303.41, political leaders do not have the capability of stepping out of the boat they cannot get out of the boat they cannot accomplish that which every one thinks is impossible
1303.62,1306.92, it is only people of faith
1307.13,1329.3, the church or perhaps beside the church not in the church but it is only people of faith who really have the capability of stepping out of the boat it is only people of faith who have the ability to call to bear upon the impossible problems of the world
1329.75,1332.99, power of the risen christ
1334.22,1337.94, that means that we can have hope
1338.06,1343.04, the message of the story of peter is that there is hope
1343.88,1350.63, even hope for a world of justice and peace some day
1350.93,1353.6, with the power of his
1356.12,1359.03, didn't look before he leaped
1360.08,1365.0, last he at least he leaped
1368.69,1407.15, antoinette aeternitate
1407.45,1474.44, he teetotallers
1476.45,1507.68, sometimes when i said in a physical church i'm reminded of two main times in the service one is when i'm sitting in the purling toward the front toward the song leader worship later the pasture that is preaching i think of jesus teaching the disciples and being before them in them looking at him but the second thing i think of his sitting at the fordable
1508.07,1519.98, and even though i may be in the pew the idea is to remember jesus that my wife disciples as they sat around and looked not just at chess but looked at each other
1520.4,1527.66, as we come to the table once again were given that opportunity to
1527.96,1543.14, look at each other this little bit difficult here but we still try to imagine each other through the eyes of christ as christ would see us at the table and asked us not to oblige him
1543.17,1547.79, imitate him as we share our bread and his cup with one another
1548.48,1550.16, we trip
1552.02,1571.79, but we thank you for this bread in this cup that's before us before each person here whether its physical bread and cup or something like that was held in their mind we thank you for giving us this way remembering what you call us to do in times of trouble
1572.27,1576.71, so calm and timidly in all time
1576.74,1578.21, to the table
1578.69,1585.02, in this bread and co our food our table as she would do and christ name
1586.07,1597.44, from that last night as jesus was eating with his disciples he took a loaf of bread and after he had blessed it he broke it he said to them to this
1597.44,1617.27, remember said he in the same way after the head finished eating he took a couple of inanities is a new covenant and a blood prouder you do this in her memory me for as often as ye eat this bread
1617.39,1625.7, drink of this cup he told the lord story he tells his step was light till he comes again
1625.73,1626.75, come
1628.07,1633.86, of christ broken for him a cup of blessing for out for you
1634.34,1666.98, the oneirocritical
1667.28,1714.38, the anaesthetic the power of christ
1714.68,1723.89, you enable you to reach out him low to reach out in power and strength
1723.92,1727.97, courage and always to have
1728.99,1764.21, etiennette
