1765.71,1778.22, question would be what's best in the second for libraries and the best thing is arriving here it's the networking the people to get to know new places
1778.73,1780.17, all some
1780.44,1785.21, everything is summed up in our inhere right now i just had
1785.63,1836.96, an hour ago or last librarian now were celebrating our great journey heretofore eatanswill of thievery that you are here the proof to
1837.11,1841.22, libraries are very invisible they do fantastic work
1841.58,1846.5, the level in europe and they in fact we now know that their dress many
1846.59,1856.85, the objectives and names of the european parliament and the commission are that they are trying to achieve across the whole of the european population we now know that that those things are happening in the public library
1857.15,1859.52, invisible is very hard
1859.61,1868.07, people here in brussels that the commission level above the nation level to really see the benefit of public libraries at the lake level so
1868.16,1871.79, we have done research across the whole of europe
1871.79,1876.83, which now shows that there is a direct link between what happens in public libraries
1876.89,1882.98, and i what the european commission wants to achieve for the european economy and social benefit
1883.1,1888.5, our citizens so what are we doing here to day well on 
1888.89,1896.81, librarians from across europe and beyond have cycled from amsterdam here to the european parliament to day and they arrived
1897.05,1902.06, at any peace to tell them and to help them understand
1902.18,1904.91, the benefits of the public library are so
1904.91,1918.35, and it's about dispelling myths and rumors about what a public library is that they've cycle many miles across europe to come and deliver their message and the pearly excited
1918.53,1922.7, and a really listening and they've invited them into the
1922.76,1964.4, malibran and then they are hoisting the laden to night so i think this is the most exciting republic librarianship at the european parliament that there's been and this is the start of a great campaign and that campaign is getting the european parliament and european parliamentarians empoigne up to a statement that values public libraries and tells the european commission they should valparaiso as the shininess
1964.58,1968.87, starts and promoting probably libraries here in the open pane
1968.99,1971.27, if you look in for the european
1971.63,1982.97, union member states and union egalement itself it seems to me that when we had a fine surprise is at the moment the first thing where we caught hester
1983.27,1984.65, the culture
1984.65,1987.83, and we can feel them
1988.34,1999.32, i got those things because they are most sensitive mother but and when we did coming about the sustainable growth and you know
1999.35,2017.74, with the pace of the knowledge and i think it good singer also for the one is made to all the so that he think about it what is composed important thing and what is the basic things for they have the same and what we have to keep
2017.8,2032.95, so i think it's absolutely vital i think it will create great interest and in peasant to day who the cyclists were the visite european parliament today reticular concluded now here at
2033.25,2035.05, our inpatient
2035.35,2037.36, and
