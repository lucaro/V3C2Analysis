15.3,24.63, what if you have to move it on the side moreover of the bankrupt library of the university of california at berkeley
25.35,43.89, upon great libraries of the world eaten
47.13,74.97, you take to the library and note book a laptop for the past two months if he came to the bank graft library at the university of california at berkeley i made to bring one of these emotional the meteorite way to sing about it is if you had a keepsake of some kind
75.21,128.37, ring or a document like a special love letter or something that was so precious to you that in a fire or disaster you'd stick it in your coat and run out the door you are the public and that the public had fifteen million of these items that's the way to think of the bancroft library the collaboration between our library administration are staff or contractors or campus project managers and are architects and consultation wonderful items harefield's
128.61,132.24, without ever having counted i mean
132.36,134.13, i had to if i had to
134.28,143.97, another number of pages that have survived i would say it's getting up there toward a million i first started planning for this in nineteen ninety five
144.75,146.04, my first
146.34,149.82, time line showed that we finished
150.24,160.53, seven years ago in this process we are losing something like twenty four thousand square feet and this was precisely since for tears that
161.79,165.66, go all the way out to the edges and were a threat to the building
165.75,166.89, we have a quite
167.19,171.06, that building is roughly three hundred yards
171.48,172.98, fault
173.49,176.67, and the last time that fault let rip
179.7,181.26, the trees down
181.89,184.53, we know that because we have the only photo
185.34,186.18, election
186.24,188.16, the spring of
188.34,230.88, i got a call from tom coster who was the associate vice chancellor for capital projects budgeting doesn't look like this project is going to start until and i said oh that's great because that'll give us time to start cultivating donors and three months later i get a call from tom a coster and he said well the building that was scheduled for the davis campus has been postponed and so the ponies now become available and we want to start doing this project in hand by the way you've got twenty four hours to make a decision so that's what i said we've got to do this because if we don't
230.97,306.06, this opportunity lord knows when it'll come our way again and that's how it all started the architect chosen for the bankrupt library size creepit where the red cliff architects working with dull and tame architects and planners our first job as a arachides firm was for the library of berkeley we did renovation of the artistry slide like brain and that was back in nineteen ninety two they have more current background on doing libraries in the sealyham more large building experience of together we made a very good team for preaching all the issues of soothes library in the patio in tantalisation that are willing for the community and projects that are bigger than just ourselves and have a sort of future for for every one who uses them and so we do a lot of community projects were committing process and committee participation is actually part of the design my role in this particular part of the bancroft has been to really help utilitate the process because in a community process or dealing with more than just a single owner your really dealing with a whole group of people in the dealers are endless we were the
306.24,325.2, unusual project is the largest fund raising effort that the berkeley university library has ever been involved in a happened to be something that focused on bankrupt iroquois about million dollars to match a comparable amount from the state funding
325.29,341.37, and it wasn't at all clear that we were going to be able to achieve this having characterized how to define the project had to get a decent cost on it and then have a model inescation so you put that all in so in your capital fanning process you not stuck down the road well when this project was first
341.64,345.75, kind of conceptual mode and a budget was said it was a low millions
346.08,366.57, and we got involved we knew that there had been signification we knew it had to be late is early but nobody would find later about that half way through the planning the construction cost in the bay area just shot up this was just about the time that china started going through its economic form and they were sucking up enormous amounts of the cement and steel
366.63,368.37, in fact the budget
368.43,380.55, pretty much doubled from our usual estimate how do you go about asking people to give money to the library i call up and i say i came i
380.55,404.04, sally i joe cathy i'd like to have one with you some time soon because i want to ask you for some money is ticketing is kind of great and we all sat around the room and it was an opportunity for everyone to voster opinion in their vision for the bankrupt in three words the roderburgs complicated by history
404.07,415.44, the library is physically joined to the dog library built in nineteen ten and designed by the campus architect john galen howard in the board classical style
415.98,437.34, not itself was designed in that same style by a later but also a famous architect arthur brown junior the new bank craft had not only to be safer more accessible in provider environment for its holdings it had to be true to the spirit of howard and brown and that bozarris
437.37,476.7, but decision was made but the cheapest thing to do the clearest response to the problem at hand would be to cut the interior and keep the shell of the building why because esthetically it was important to keep that part of the university looking the same as erostratus quo and because making an entire exterior the building would have changed its historical look and destroyed the area of the campus which is rather beautiful and harmonious as arctics are are trentanove this building which in a respect
477.03,488.7, both the connection to do proper but also work within a context of our sorrows spirit it was very challenging did always sit with how the bancroft folks saw think should go and
488.79,493.68, design kind of unfolded from there we did different trials we looked at both styles we thought
494.16,510.36, we had it figured out turned out we did not and the donors agreed we did not so we were harder to try and find the right inter expression which largely the project was interred the extra was formed we weren't allowed to touch it for it torkleson
510.57,514.86, but the inside was really were the challenge was in the style had to really
515.04,520.8, look back to old world libraries that was their sense of the collection the importance of the bankrupt collection with such that
520.98,522.87, they wanted more of a worldly
522.93,549.0, architectural statement they didn't really let the streamlined simple look that our surrounded set up in the building so we had to take it back you know in time a little bit to a collection or an expression of the collection that they felt was appropriated been here for many years the original one was an interesting experience was and that one
549.24,551.97, staff were basically not consulted
552.03,553.26, told
553.47,559.02, when they pointed out a short comings inefficiencies and impalpabilities
559.17,611.58, they were largely ignored in the public areas i think we did have to negotiate quite a bit in terms of reading her own baithen there thinking that that is an experience of you know people in place and engineless an aesthetic experience where were obviously thinking about being a preserving the material making sure the things are handled properly making sure that we can have sightings on all of the researches that are looking at the material and we slowly worked our way through understanding the collections understanding their space needs and how we needed orange the space working with the overall library organization determined how regenerating that is a huge part of our whole project and these
611.67,632.82, it was a dangerous building that we needed to strengthen it and we wanted to strengthen in the way that didn't just try the integrity of the building as it is even though it's beltonians dere historic building on the camp in an attaque a nice building or drawing really show for the reifenstein but to deepen trusting of it was quite a thing to see and that i was
633.51,641.16, like a bomb down cell of a building at one point one we spread everything out of the building towering and put it back together again better
641.22,643.95, library and so on the east side of the building
644.34,646.77, it connects in various sort of formal
647.07,658.02, away to the main part of deliberate you expect if you walked into that entrance would face as the campanile very accent you be able to walk through the nearby could do that you just had a star and you go up
658.17,661.05, to the offices and bankruptcies
661.26,676.95, are we configuration now that door becomes another entrance to a library and a corridor takes you straight through to do i pray and it just one of really changes the whole complex important's goin to be like when we're done you say bosses gold
677.34,686.28, drivers budgets they're all are bosses in the end and they all want something in the the goal is to lay out clearly
686.28,699.75, the key drivers never forgetting which ones are really truly the drivers in this case safety was a driver and then the collection the safety of the preservation of the collections was the real driver everybody else under that fits under something
699.75,701.25, figure that out
701.67,711.18, then there's stratification have under that and by the way you're building a building the first floor which has left high shells its existing slab would not
711.36,726.12, accommodate the load of these shelves on their upwards of i think six hundred pounds per square foot and it rolls so for early on we were putting in steel beams beneath the first floor into the basement ceiling to support
726.18,730.77, rolling load and that became so problematic that at one point
730.83,744.96, a structural peer review the slight old sort of went off where we ended have actually doing marrying in a new slab over the existing slab six inches in time them together so in effect now are new slab is eleven inches of concrete
745.02,749.85, that is able to sustain the rolling load and we didn't have to introduce all this steel in the basement
749.85,758.16, you've got a boat elevation with nice little stairs it wasn't a very big portal but it was well done as he rounded a good job
758.52,765.03, you're being told to put a ramp on it well what comes to mind when you do a boat building
765.06,766.32, symmetry
766.44,767.82, proportion
767.85,835.11, of materials all these things come up and yet oratorio new buildings are to do ringfield agreeable on cooeperate have a hedonistic structure trifork within that occupies or were they with liveliest the movies a place for everything and everything in its place as the basic library museum are places that are repositories for beautiful art objects or archeological objects or whatever this place as a repository for manuscripts for written objects for printed rare printed objects for photographs so the idea is take students who have not had the opportunity to see these sometimes very ancient things and to show them the utility of actually looking at a document on the internet you see a written manuscript perhaps the internet sometimes it's very difficult to turn it over and look at it
835.23,844.86, on the boats on the back side of the thing maybe there's no every important the three that you mentioned that our function is where we do at a real work
845.01,850.8, i ristori office the mark twain papers and the optimist prepares project
851.13,853.17, be in the building with us
853.26,864.39, the mark twain papers and the tebtunis project require continuous access to the manuscript documents that comprised their collections and so terranova vaults
864.39,866.88, proximity to were of the staff are working
866.94,876.03, you look at everything and there's always a million after it how come it doesn't work but as it turns out in today's world there's always never enough millions to go around and so
876.15,879.72, we're like any number of the craftsman everybody
879.96,889.5, got to cover their cost and as we were mentioning the process is well a lot of where our time goes is to keep the process consensus driven
889.62,897.96, the best minds in it and yet thorough and leading to a set of drawings that you can build from that's
898.2,906.42, we have to do but it's complicated by the number of players so i was put in charge of coordinating the library side of that move with the
906.72,914.28, various other parties involved the planners the architects the eventually the move
914.31,919.29, resolved to various campus players
919.5,923.28, i was represented in the background library and 
924.96,927.18, first thing that we did was
927.27,935.04, a small task forces in the library to look at various aspects of the move getting the collections ready to be moved
936.12,962.1, in containers when items were fragile things like that and also just locating where everything is there wisconsin charge of figuring out where everything needed to go which also meant that i was basically in charge of making sure that they went from point a point be an efficient manner mosbyites now i say an average of six years
962.19,969.96, so they've done the libraries they've been there we usually go from library to library which is were complex
969.99,975.18, we have a very strong devoted staff and what was really remarkable to all of us
975.21,978.99, how strong and devoted the moving company staff were
978.99,983.94, to enormous pride and what they were doing and the relationship and the report
983.97,998.88, was phenomenal to watch you get chaos in every project i mean there's always got to be an issue i think it was just kind of the start up and getting the staff from the library to feel comfortable with our services the guys were there for about a week
998.97,1004.55, side by side i mean the first week the requirement was everybody was going to be with the library staff
1004.76,1010.58, they wanted to make sure we handle everything property everything was taken and wrapped and protected as we had discussed in the
1010.58,1011.84, meetings and
1011.9,1013.64, like somethin about a week
1013.94,1019.22, where they weren't standing right there the kind of moved away and allow the staff or staff to
1019.31,1022.4, the moon not to say that they weren't on sight but
1022.82,1036.74, trust established within that first week i run the guys the crew and all the books that come in on this side make sure everything is going all right make sure the crews do and everything proper went through a pretty lengthy process in picking out
1036.74,1041.3, vendors which was nora we spent a lot of time
1041.3,1051.74, picking up the right people and then when we brought them in we actually had her conservation team creates her of a workshop
1051.77,1058.91, for them it was about a half day where they showed them how they needed to handle the material to moving them
1058.94,1060.05, the
1060.08,1074.57, shelves on to the cards sort of give them an idea of what we're looking for if there was anything wrong and the crews that they had were excellent whenever anything seemed out of the ordinary they were
1074.81,1091.73, they would pipe right out and say hey this is not right softening at the top and ripeneth knew to grab you know the bindings of the side the masters
1092.42,1102.26, where the one of the biggest challenges not only are they are very difficult to move physically but they were also in probably the farthest
1102.41,1106.07, corner of the original building
1106.37,1109.28, that had no elevator access
1109.43,1134.75, only narrow doorways and stairwells that had to be negotiated and i think one of the one of the cleverest things that we did was work with the moving company to design special parts so that the map files could be disassembled safely transported up to staging area where they could then be reassembled and then transported as a card to be desired to move a facetious again
1134.78,1141.05, what a comment but just which one commented bonnet eight percent of the folios
1141.32,1142.88, inside of her
1143.06,1148.37, we could design to adjust the shell it if some of the ones were overside or smaller
1148.52,1151.85, a lot about shells with the material on a card
1152.06,1156.53, a standard car with the fixed self we only had about the three shells or
1156.68,1158.6, stay on the
1158.81,1160.16, most
1161.09,1164.24, complicated of the move was
1164.24,1172.34, the paris their documents and go back for thousands a catamount in back and forth a miles eway
1174.41,1181.25, no curator and his red mind whatever tolerate that and we moved them down from
1181.7,1183.98, several campus to hear
1184.43,1187.1, but a police escort in the morning
1187.19,1239.12, we took years to assemble the collection and then we had to you know to get it where it was and we only had a few weeks too completely the entire thing i was doing my work on the earthquake and as francisco i was looking for specific photographs about buildings trying to understand what happened to them oftener of the fire and the barouche buildings i could write the history that hadn't been written about how buildings had performed in the earthquake i could never have done that without the collection of your putting words redounding from
1239.15,1246.11, taking a correct given the retaining walls go in or the cherwell go in north and south
1246.44,1257.0, the two haralson south side one of the northeastern west and there are two heralds had a north and south on the west
1257.03,1266.81, and of the building as well so that's going to protect the building from shaking and understand that when you started to he won't stop it from shaking
1266.84,1322.19, the ideas and stop it from falling apart when the shape he is the laughing lass here and they used to run the old walls the plaster moulds with plaster paris and actually made to guide to make the molds in other come out with george the architects come up with the shapes that they want to make it draw and we sent it off they may actually make a black mould out of the shade its reversed they make em old to fit that glass shape and then they bore it and the thermite together at the ends with the tape giant and then the taper nor the plasters take over it turned the filling partingtonian together in the day but emersoniana endangers undeterminateness have inspector here on a daily basis because we can't afford to hold the contractor up and we can't afford to delay any thing thirty or forty different departments that we go to and if they have any complaints or problems or conflicts
1322.37,1325.19, and to come back and say you can't do it on that day
1325.4,1331.7, he got away and we had we brought them mechanical aforesaid last saturday
1331.97,1337.52, we had to go down some eisenachers well it was plain for the saturday before which as calves
1337.55,1346.76, with people here and has not the data shut eroding prayer so through that access interruption process
1346.76,1348.65, called and said no way
1348.98,1352.31, it moved a week and so that's the contractor issue
1352.37,1355.64, the universities doing something and
1355.85,1367.76, contract it affect his work then i try and communicate the other way the sweet offices into which we are moving has been expanded i mean it used to be where we were and we really had no
1369.08,1377.96, to let visitors sit at this table right here because of the whole room was crowded with fine capitol hardly cocheres
1378.02,1460.13, years from this first feasibility study to now oftentimes as a trigger of some terrible thing that you have to remedy like the similarity is your opportunity to do something else and i think that in the bankrupt project that all these opportunities were taken niederstetter collections so when a library building is deemed unsafe it seems like a simple matter to make a decision to make it safer but that simple decision requires attention to building codes and environmental regulations and architectural preservation guidelines experts on everything from heavy machinery to advance climate control systems must become participants architects designers movers and lawyers and to the mixed and then at the staff the library users in the community managing and administering those groups is a daunting task removing and then replacing
1460.16,1485.57, recollections lock stock and barrel is not a side of library administration that many people see that's why we visited one of the nation's most celebrated libraries the bankrupt as it undertook and fulfilled one of the greatest challenges of library can faceties when we visit another library on great libraries of the world
1485.57,1603.14, the one
1605.21,1605.99, he
