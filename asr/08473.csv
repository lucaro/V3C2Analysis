112.02,115.14, but 
115.41,127.29, but but
127.71,139.2, but but letting rotrou a hole in a room it sounds like a crazy plan

192.63,202.23, but every time we meet jesus i astonished by what he does i wonder what is going to do it this time
205.8,211.86, the fourth friends made a hole in the roof
212.52,218.16, it was finished the four men lowered their friend into the room in front of jesus
220.59,222.69, careful 
222.72,227.4, a level only there
228.12,229.32, he
230.61,231.99, on
232.71,235.89, jesus was impressed at their faith in him
236.01,237.87, with these people have
238.5,241.17, friend you'll send a forgiven
241.8,257.67, what his sins of a given that outrageous only god can forgive sins jesus thinks he's good that's an insult to god himself
257.94,278.01, jesus knew what they were thinking so he turned to them and said why are your heart filled with such thoughts what is easier to forgive sins or to heal a man whispered as wife oh i think they're both pretty hard to do
278.28,282.45, more or less the point dear his wife whispered back
285.3,292.71, prove to you that i have god's power and authority to do the thing you can't see i'll do the thing you can
293.58,295.38, so
295.5,308.55, the cool mats and walk home and the man died right away just like that he stood up
310.92,313.14, happened
313.32,323.61, he has gone too far what a miracle did jesus say rossini forgiven before he killed him
323.73,326.64, it means that jesus really is sent by god
326.94,329.31, i can't get my head round this
329.43,347.64, being forgiven and held still think the chicken idea would have worked but i was still hovers in the man said to his wife so if jesus healed the man then maybe he really can forgive the bad things that people do
348.36,353.67, less the point dear his wife replied praise god
354.6,361.92, jesus would heal moth but jesus became all the wrong things he done as well and he did that first
362.49,364.92, wonder which was the more important thing
