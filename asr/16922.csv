0.0,30.72, again to france for motion revolver i just wanted to cover a few ways that you can attempt to speed up the render of your project again there's never one simple single answer to making your project render faster it's always going to depend completely upon your computers ability how much an you have installed video cards such things like that
30.96,46.2, but there are a few things a few steps that you should always take when rendering a project filed no matter how intense the project is number one probably one of the most important things
46.2,55.98, rendering a file and i'm just going to grab one here from our great thinkers project and dropped that into the render que
56.58,59.46, when you have a project
59.91,66.33, the render her a composition i should say in the render number one
66.51,85.89, make sure that you click off of everything within the project window whatever you have reviewed in this little box right here is actually taking up ran and one little trick he could do is go up to after a fixed preferences and go to believe its reviews and 
85.95,88.71, no no previous it is
89.04,91.92, let me see here
93.0,104.28, in display this sable tunnels in project panel when you click this box what's going to happen is when you tuggeth here this little
104.31,106.83, box isn't going to update and
107.82,149.94, even though that might be a little bit annoying because you can't really see what it is it's actually saving you an it's not taking memory away from trying to render a preview for this little box so that can help you save there as well as when you're not make sure that all of your composition windows are closed because if you have one of your confined you don't have your cap like as your rendering the project after affixes actually going to try to represent scrub with the head through the essentials going to be rendering the project twice
150.15,153.84, at the same time which as you can imagine
153.93,158.16, kills perform it so make sure all of your
158.16,166.98, now are closed when rendering another good idea before hitting render is to go up to and it
167.16,227.94, here all and what this is going to do it's going to purge whatever is currently in your memory cash whether it's pre preventers wither its image cashes even you are undesigning purge everything so keep in mind though if you do this and uncultivated this so once i purged all that has pretty much wiped the ran clean and i've got a clean slate to work with another important thing especially on a man is to never render with any browser open any any whim clerestory crom fire fox no matter what it is if there's any way you could not use a web browser while rendering in after effects
228.0,240.96, don't do it because i'm not sure of the technical aspects but for some reason it seems that after effects does not like when you are browsing the web and rendering at the same time
241.17,252.45, that's why it's always kind o nice to have a laptop or an pad or something like that to kind of work on while you're rendering because
252.96,261.3, we browser especially so far in particular seems to be a little bit of a ramonet kill any
261.81,276.42, and rendering power that you may be trying to get other more advantage to steps that you can try to take include going up to after experience and memory a multi processing we open that up
276.45,309.3, there you'll see a bunch of numbers which might look a little confusing and scary at first and again these settings completely depend upon your system performance obviously you can see currently have gianetto annable render multiple sat frame simultaneously if i were to enable that basically what's going to happen is after affixing to try to render more than one frames
309.48,320.67, the computer that i have is a six cormac and its obviously hyperides after effects this seeing that as twelve caps
321.06,352.68, there are setting here which you can actually custome leaving a certain amount of pus and a certain amount of ran for other applications say if you wanted to work and photospheric on while you are rendering which i just advised you not to do obviously it's always better if you're working with intense renders just to leave after effects alone and let it do its thing and go to do something else for a while so
352.92,360.72, i played with settings with my own computer and i think i have a custom is pretty well for
360.84,372.9, what i have i've gotten some pretty fast render times in this this isn't always like the best solution depending on the project as well
373.17,428.16, you're rendering like say a frame sequence you know rendering multiple frame simultaneously might be a good idea however if you've got a really really intensive project with a lot of effects going on a lot of three layers this might not be the best option you actually might get a longer render by checking this box here so again it's all trial and error but this is another option you could explore now projects specific things that you can do to increase or decrease render time i should say an increase performance say for example your working with one of our afternoon composition if you're not going to be broadcasting this video over the air waves like a it's not going to go to v i
428.43,467.79, only going to be playing this on website or the web you may want to consider rendering at a lower resolution and again obviously h video looks awesome on the web so he would be one option but another option you have is to render the hen eighty cop at half resolution by going here to your render settings if you change this to half resolution this is going to create a nine sixty by five forty five now that's not technically he do if you are going to try to play a nine sixty by five forty frame video full frame on a t v monitor
468.06,477.3, you're going to have a little bit of quality lost there but the rendered time and the file sized differences are going to actually be pretty good
477.45,507.93, for example you have a render that's taking you about ten hours by setting this to half resolution that doesn't actually mean it's going to take five hours that might actually mean it might only take two hours you don't actually cut the time and half you actually might cut it more than in a half as far as the renting so the advantages there as far as time goes might be worth it just keep in mind that you may be taking a quality it there
508.38,542.31, for a file size goes i get a lot of questions about why is my file gigs is it so large a quick time i can't can't play it because it's too big while changes are you probably rendered the animation with a lost less compression which means that you're going to be producing a very high quality filed but the fishes going to be massive and likely choke whatever computer you're trying to play it on especially if you just rendered a full detention
542.49,550.74, is that you have would be clicking on this lawless option here and going to
553.14,556.92, have i will go to fort options
557.46,575.16, and then change this from the animation code to something like photo jape this is a pretty universal code and should play on any machine if we choose that option and then set the quality sat a eighty five at a pretty good option usually
575.22,636.93, the false is going to go down a lot but you're not going to really notice too big of a quality head so that's one thing you can do there to lower the file size also as far as the audio goes sometimes audio can be fairly large you don't always have to render for a audio you can usually get by at least on your point one sometimes i do quality is in a huge issue you can render the well but i usually leave the sixteen bit and stereo alone because if he tried to render a pit audio sometimes the results are in all that favorable but anyway those are some options you can try to reduce the interims of your project unfortunately like i said there isn't one single answer or a perfect solution for everything faster entertain
637.05,647.04, to france for motion revolver and thanks for watching
