2.85,16.68, this is big ideas from the arc is thy fast into crowd or sing and what it is now i've got a confess even though this talk titilation i hate the term
17.19,52.95, it was a kind of rose to prominence in old jeff i write articles for wired magazine and its kind of been adopted by every body is an old encompassing bucket i disingenuity is starting to be felt to be slightly negative because it feels really transaction if you're like you just taking from people and giving nothing back and so to me and i fell through the course of this tart you see that i think it's just the first incarnation of something far far more exciting that's going on so if we think about why crowd or sing
53.07,74.94, to day has the traction it does it's nothing new you know through human head well since certainly the industrial revolution in that say the seventeenth century we tied building really efficient structures we building structures that are all about just command and control their about controlling what you produce and by definition is expensive to run them
75.27,85.47, only a matter of time before people realized that it might make sense to take stuff from outside that so pyramidal hierarchy
86.07,92.37, examples of this that range all the way back i mean when i'm inspired by is the longitude prize
92.4,106.77, so in seventeen fourteen the british government struggling to keep hold of their ships they kept running into islands from including some place to her they thought we need to know better where we are that was exceptionally valuable to them so they ran
106.89,123.24, crowd solicitation they ran a competition to award twenty thousand pounds at the time which his huge amounts of money as you can imagine for the person actable them to pinpoint the longer the other ship within twenty third twenty north comes
123.75,142.05, misdirected blackens her john harrison he won that prize and the thing they did that was smart as they actually incentive people just to make little baby steps of progress so crowd sousing is not new it may suddenly be fashionable we may all be hearing about it talking about it hating it loving it
142.47,158.28, not now it's been around for ages and you've got some good examples of it in australia so on i find really inspiring is night nine designs to australian company they've moved the head of its now i think to the west coast of the states but they completed about forty five thousand projects
158.34,160.32, around and
160.62,165.24, and communication design but they paying on average
165.45,177.93, signs over sort you know six hundred thousand dollars a month in prize money so effective it has traction and i think i'll continue to have traction because actually it's obvious
178.11,189.57, it fills it nils you to grow your work force with a line incentive you reward people when it works so this stuff is pretty obvious to light the idea that prizes
189.75,193.29, i gather new intellectual property
193.5,203.22, all were starting you know if you believe some advocates and proponents of it you think that these types of prize base systems are absolutely the answer
204.03,207.9, simply they work because you get a collection of people
208.05,218.04, ideas someone moderate it in a closed way so the intellectual property stay safe so you can use it and then it gets ranked in the prizes are awarded
218.13,224.61, this is like the most obvious interpretation of crowding and it's been pretty successful
224.91,230.85, the closest to the longer the prize i think that we've had in recent history is the nettle
231.12,232.17, i
232.62,245.04, net fiaunce that if they could find people that would improve their algorithm fresh recommending which video you'd like by just temper sent they give you a million dollars
245.61,249.75, it was one with minutes to spare into
250.41,253.08, been on by combining
253.14,264.51, a people's different ideas together even things around your emotion and how your memory works on different days so this stuff will continue so i could stop this talk here and say great
264.78,266.64, if the ants
267.06,285.96, can all stop worrying about alternatives let's just run heap surprises but i think that's kind of the early version is one point of crowd souring this much more interesting stuff coming so to hide right that point i love to show you a video whereat an adder from nineteen ninety seven for microsoft in carter
286.92,292.56, so i think it will you should meet remember it with certainly for sinister
293.07,306.12, ollendorfian link and bedewed site when you're hungry for information or you're going to call my rosalind cartismand situation to lock old there
306.66,318.45, how the fry so this guy thought he had the solution is looking pretty smug about it might console had the solution they bought materials intellectual property from insight epeios they were convinced
318.54,320.25, i had it at
320.31,325.08, even that no one else would offer a better insight lapidoth
325.17,332.58, we all know that something different came on the scene and actually something else came on the scene that contributed to them closing in carter
332.97,335.7, and that was wikipedia
335.88,340.02, last year wikipedia had its ten billion added
340.95,343.17, a billion dots
343.17,347.94, people that basically were not remunerated in his traditional approach
348.03,351.9, no prize based system in wikipedia
352.02,359.01, the stuff that gets me really excited its open systems its network collaboration
359.22,368.55, the traditional price place closed systems and they looked distinctly different to the price batistes
368.97,379.26, clever design in there there's a huge community you can tap into people move in and out of the community will talk about the incentives to participate in it later
379.71,393.06, you can see it's completely different the systems basically have to run where ideas run they so revolve around the system there thrown out by people if they don't like them it's a self moderated system
393.51,404.19, feels and looks completely different to the high rocky we saw before it no longer is that sort of triangle the pyramidal structure is more like a network
404.43,408.03, and net work or interesting when your designing systems
408.18,415.44, a more interesting than pyramids because they enable kind of darwin's to came mergence stuff to grow
415.62,419.22, all notes to fall away not to grow
420.06,431.13, stuff completely different it's a different approach less newtonian or dictatorial efficiency and more adaptability emergence
431.19,433.08, thinking
434.1,435.9, so
435.9,443.13, kind of lead you to the question is wikipedia just to complete free handrunning lish speaking editors
443.25,445.14, just a word of
445.17,447.54, the sound of a trend
448.08,453.39, probably the best way to aunt that question one of the places we turn to when thinking about it
453.75,462.21, the gentleman that invest invented the most famous triangular framework in human history on humanistic psychology i ran as low
463.59,482.64, cried the high rocky of needs which whether we like it or not will obscure to this is the stuff that gets us going in this been awful examples where we've had to focus at the bottom of the bed the pyramidion around safety and physiological security but actually the fact that were all saints room
483.0,486.72, testament the fact that you guys are shooting up the pyramid
487.2,501.18, your way out and if you look at those needs what keeps us a happy sense of belonging sense of esteem self actualization the question is are we finding new ways
501.27,517.8, as if we were set in this room thirty years ago we probably would have said the waiter your sense of esteem your sense of belonging was the american dream like two point four kids to point for homes two point four cards whatever its materialism
518.25,520.83, radically changed recently
521.67,539.01, well financial crisis which you guys i lawleigh to be a is to figure out what you are talking about but i now understand and it's a big issue so that change i think the way that we actually see belonging in esteem and self actualization
539.43,556.89, she had experiences towards the talent of this year the incredibly difficult for certainly me to understand how complex and painful the process was but if i look at the sort were base communities that are growing around topics like this you can see its trigger changes
557.55,564.27, the question is household of this stuff changing what malone that we all wanted to achieve
565.11,576.36, i think it's changing all three so you know but longing it's kind of an interesting one or a steam there's examples all around australian society at the moment that show us
576.63,579.99, you guys are changing and interpretation
580.08,592.53, belonging as tenths is a start up actually started in undistorted or down in sidney got forty car brands now and basely you can rent out your own car to people for the day
593.46,596.97, more about access than on a ship
597.21,617.01, a big change in that pyramid we no longer need to own everything another interpretation of that i think doing incredibly is the garrigan this one started in on dainty and the sixteen hundred and thirteen sails up there were people a literary just saving stuff they don't really need
617.46,633.45, london we've got this explosion of storage companies their everywhere and what a wonderful way of sham people that they've got too much more than they need that materialism is kind of shifting so it's more about access we understand that
633.45,636.24, finding new ways to signal belonging
637.5,640.44, an interesting way of signaling belonging
641.13,648.75, as at last we twenty million people had favored backbones face book pages three per cent
649.32,656.28, the use is a face book it's unbelievable people are using as a way of showing what they belong to
656.46,665.46, kind of an emergent tribalism it's a different way of saying so you guys you know you can see this hundred thousand people have liked you to gearge
666.12,680.94, kainwhat that made that that's one to send by the way of australia's ten million face but uses rather than three percent of the worlds which is interesting in itself that's probably an important statistic if you are a politician
681.12,683.76, i think pretty hard about what that means
684.75,692.94, i said there are causes the motivating huge numbers of australian parent of australia's million people
693.36,695.7, party patient up
696.0,702.27, she gunmore about the marshes a wonderful campaign for attuning into action
702.51,715.17, if demonstrating newest new belonging and potentially self actualization so triatic through a way of showing how this desire to learn or participate
715.2,727.86, changing and google trends for you guys are really fun to to do it to every time you put a search thread into google you might go go smarter you make it clever you're doing all the work for them
727.86,733.17, i just need to run the numbers and predict and if you do google trends
733.5,741.33, two searches in australia to the just search of australia i thought the internet people often search for discounts
741.42,744.84, people often also search for how to do stuff
745.35,756.96, if you look at that change i think it symbolizes this inflection were seeing of how people are finding new ways to sell actualize so this blue flat line you see
756.96,765.15, this count is people searching for this counteract all unchanged look at the green line which his people searching how to do stuff on the internet
766.26,768.42, hugely changing
768.66,770.97, finding new ways
771.06,779.94, masses and example which expires inspires me not expires me that hideous inspires me
780.27,786.27, a light colored loewen seven year old single mama unworth in the up
786.93,793.98, she was passionate about make up and she sitting how to video on line to day she said a hundred night million views
794.52,798.27, in she's actually in partnership with her in make up line
799.11,806.85, she saw actualized in it became incredibly valuable i love this what you can't see here is within a day of the wedding
807.24,810.03, no wedding day made
810.36,818.61, seeing that the macheson but the number of new species twenty thousand within forty hours she so fast to react
818.91,821.25, people love her because she's honest
821.28,836.85, so another way that she looking at magistrate about these needs and unavised any view this frame work its frame by cold cream the cane harvard business school and he's kind of blotted out all of the needs against extrinsic motivations money
837.24,843.93, coursing usually upright his whole less excited about it because there's all of this other space
843.93,845.37, probably
845.49,864.45, right more to drive towards masses so excited about that stuff and i think we see everywhere just as a setter i think important example called said arms twenty eight year old in he was allegedly murdered by police in june of twenty ten
864.72,875.19, didn't make any noise a really amazing guy could wilcome who actually wore a goglet up a face but page at half a million lights and it basically triggered
876.33,893.91, of rage on january trique in egypt it triggered the star of a revolution i think actually he does a better job of explaining why this is different and why this meets this new participation economy the understanding about before i let you listen to him woman's
894.15,897.03, announced on the page the locations
897.03,926.67, down face but i had to back up an i use google groups to send a mass male campaign to all these people in order to fill them here are the locations and please spread it among your friends and every one knew eventually so so definitely technology play the great rule here you know i helped keeping people informed it help making a snow all of us collaborate i called this revolution to point of revision to point all is i say that our evolutions like wikipedia
927.09,949.62, every one is contributing content i don't know the names of the people contributing the content this is exactly what happened relucent point in egypt was exactly the same every one was contributing spoke pieces bit and pieces as we drew the whole picture withdrew the whole picture over evolution and that picture no one is the hero in that picture
950.43,957.03, so when he talks about drawing the picture he talks about creating the plain field with technology
957.09,984.24, notes emergent behaviors if you look at the janeen fifth or the uprising on twitter the noise you see this is acutely true whereas in the past you would have had this pyramidal shape for some reason the red not projecting well but the ones that look blacker attleystan language the ones here that are in blue you can see her would be english language so you can see him and is probably recognizes one of the most influential characters here
984.48,987.18, didn't the influence in any way
987.39,993.42, exactly what we're talking about it reminds us completely of this sort network base of roach
993.69,999.96, reminded completely the actually the pyramid that was in paris transition and this darwinii
1000.17,1015.44, replaced so my view in a kind of the first half of widows with you is that this participation more than just doing it for cash more than doing it just for the obvious extrinsic motivator is he to stay
1015.89,1018.02, it's got a row of anything
1018.05,1030.2, so then the question familiar ide one question for all of us ideas actually what does it mean what does this mean for idea so were lointain company and we help a line grow
1031.37,1036.95, creating new brand services business models products
1036.95,1039.35, interaction design website
1039.95,1042.68, stuff as important as it's ever been
1042.8,1058.01, this participation had the opportunity potentially to make it better as disruptive but it can potentially make ideas of a better if you look at the stuff that idea really believes in the first thing is we believe passionately and diversity
1058.1,1065.36, never work in a tame idea would people with the same skill says me thank goodness it be boring
1066.41,1072.5, let the teams are eclectic we also believe passionately in going to extremes
1072.68,1077.93, so if i'm interested in what's happening in a sort martyrous credit
1078.44,1101.63, don't just fix it on the people your average customer to day because i know that they're not the customer of the future is the guise at the extremes that my great across they become the mass market so we look to them and the final thing that we do is we passionately believe in designing systems the days of being able to just differentiate around form of an object a long one it gets copied
1101.78,1115.34, fall into the trap saying apples a success because there apparatus they are but their service their brand their retail the fact they opened up developers to developers they were beautiful as well it greatest
1116.09,1121.16, we design systems track lions and when you take all of those three things together
1121.49,1129.56, fatty that harnessing the wisdom of crowds or what we would prefer to say collaborating with crowds
1129.83,1148.52, a huge value to idea and we did what we always do we kind of build stuff to be out to think it through and we prototype so in this case we pray to the tapioca in a face book page called big conversations just to see where the people would be interested in talking with us
1148.82,1158.69, historically black brands or a monologue they just talk to the consumers their clients we wanted to see whether we had permission to have a dialogue and we learnt we did
1159.14,1176.39, so we started designing open idea so one of the ladies that designed it with me as her high and had to day we've had fine week working through a sort physical version of open idea i talk a little more about that the end by love or to share with you what we've created
1176.48,1183.5, why i hope it fits with ideas brand because there's no perfect website to anything
1183.71,1190.64, only have the best possible solution for your community so when you guys are collaborating
1190.82,1204.47, do look very different to ideas which needs a different to my personal one it's all different is based on the community so hopefully when you think about what's precious to idea you'll see why we designed open idea as we have
1204.74,1353.99, rothenstein have been danmouth best bits of the creative process or line and invite every one to join in open idea is a global community that will draw on your optimism inspiration ideas and opinions to solve problems together for the collective social good each challenge starts with a big question something to get all of us thinking next comes the inspiration face in which we all coast inspiring things that we see now there that might help a soul for in question the more visualises the better images videos and stories will all help to get every one going after inspiring one another it's time to fleurette muscles in the concept as how it you so this problem has your solution and show every one how you plan to make it a reality if some one else's idea spark something for you you can build on it open i go with designed with this way of working in mind this is where you get to collaborate with other people and where the magic really happens once concepts of folly that purtaboi face this process is exactly as it sounds he raises and comments on the concepts that you believe our best self the proper according to beginning criteria the concept that ritherdon the evaluation face when with the winning ideas being available for development by the challenge sponsor your participation in each face lusacho collaborated with others all at doctor design croton or detour which can choose to publicize or keep private it oiseau recognition and because we're all good at different parts of the great process we all have slightly different des just like in all good brainstorming session we gave the quantity as well as quality the more you add collaborates and critique in any face the bigger decorator discord become a badge of honor for community members over time in a nutshell we created an open only to the takes you through the creative process it's highly vital collaborative generates feedback and most important funhouse open idea offers its community inspiration and recognition the sight will be as good as its import and were looking forward to seeing what it becomes open ideot an open platform for innovation where we create better together
1356.06,1361.31, i think it self explanatory so i thought what we could perhaps close out with
1361.58,1362.48, kind of
1362.69,1366.05, everything in the participation economy
1366.26,1395.66, i thought maybe tatho the train of questions that i ask people when they're interested in operating this space and i do it fairly systematically because we really know never to start with for example technology so let's whistle ten questions i ask every client if they're interested in an open innovation or collaboration and are tweet out the final slide which actually be all of these lifted out in case they inspire any of your own thinking
1395.66,1405.41, actually part of what i'll do his or reference the challenge we've just run with the queen and government and then the ideas festivity sam of you guys party pay to in
1406.01,1439.67, this wonderful example we got engagements around this challenge that we kind of haven't seen before we had sustenances of need over the last eight weeks and the qualities being unbelievably good with respect to day in a workshop or helping fresh them out before they go up onto the sight for sir continued collaboration and we rastel inspired by the quality so let's go through what we loathe ten questions and then at asometon in answer to the first thing that we've learned is you have to take
1439.76,1444.53, believable care with the question that you asked your community
1444.8,1448.25, you have a good idea of what you want to learn
1448.49,1456.02, even stop because all you'll get back his noise the inert anty is if you ask a bad question you've got to get a bad dancer
1457.37,1461.75, you actually decide to design whole systems
1462.26,1464.09, allow more time
1464.3,1481.91, understand what touch points you want designed if it is design your doing as understand what the playing field is to help people understand that so when we set a question we know we've learned it's got to be inspiring it's got to be sure and it's got to be a real self could to action
1482.6,1492.56, the question is not stated by twenty years ago we could ask a question and it would remain unchanged we know now that actually questions are completely dynamic
1492.62,1500.6, a change so we know the ache the media coverage around open ideal kind of changes the fear of what the question is
1500.69,1506.57, completely out control which is fine the terms and conditions the evaluation criteria
1506.81,1522.05, partners but also the initial contributions to the side completely changed the question and one of the things we learn actually we design early on what we learnt that we could feature inspiration to help direct the community so when we see something we love we feature it
1522.56,1529.16, all people get anchored by the most recent contribution so the first thing to do
1529.16,1532.04, really understand the question you're asking
1532.43,1534.8, next thing we always
1534.98,1538.43, is actually whose well equipped to answer it
1539.0,1547.94, i got one set of questions i might choose to you know it is a chemistry based question open idea wouldn't necessarily be the right community
1548.69,1564.77, i've got a question that requires deep knowledge or retentive ly requires you know people with a specific skill set in a specific or specific part of the world you need to make sure they're in your community so ask yourself who can answer your big question
1565.16,1567.8, and then go to where they are
1568.7,1577.79, community managers we are men carry who's here to day spend a lot of time helping bring new community into challenges to make sure the quality stays high
1577.82,1583.91, really important to us and a community is grown were up to just under sixteen thousand users
1583.94,1599.54, auditories at said in a presentation about two weeks ago that it was from two countries the ideality and livarot that still bogomiles presents it as countries and territories that was awful
1599.87,1617.66, we have eight countries there were continuously looking for more coverage because we value diversity that's important to us and we see the effect the contributions i was inspired by this on everyone australian queensland challenge
1617.66,1630.62, that you see or hear i antofagasta without an event in london not so long goes one of the biggest sort contributors and he was contributing builds around servetur and he lives in later
1631.1,1640.04, so inspiring that you give people access they never had before historically the access was you just had to go to a good design school et cetera
1640.16,1645.59, we have access we can also actualize so the next question
1646.43,1660.8, you got to motivate people money is fine lookin probably not personally so i said by crowd source sing using financial reward so much because i think it makes so many other motivations you see or hear difficult
1662.06,1669.11, can see them might ovations here so money is the ultimate extrinsic motivator often collapses a lot of the other stuff
1669.29,1679.19, more excited about all of these so when we design open idea we made it more community based solution rather than a market basilio which you can imagine
1679.91,1698.57, thy people contribute i think to open idea or knowledge they contribute for recognition you can see the design question missus my one there were actually we tell people about their participation in the sight and they can choose to reveal it or not we find virtue every one reveals it which i think is in sight for its interesting we cannot from the
1699.05,1721.19, the other thing that we learn is people start to import these into the real world we see job applications with deck we see logs with people's desisting to see it just pilothouse it we actually give em bed codes a people can do that themselves the next question you guys need to ask if you're interested in open innovation is what's a process you get a run
1722.39,1731.06, the more complex the process the more careful you have to be so this is kind of a representation of an idea process we sailing
1731.12,1757.22, for inspiration we synthesize it with an come up with ideas we prototype often in a sort feedback opera then we evaluate and launch not all of those really well suited to so having every one participate initially so we focused on inspiration concerting an evaluation stuff that the crowd are well suited to help with that they can feel like their adding real value with
1757.43,1788.03, you can see the other question of course is to you and your system to be open or close we've already talked about that so when you look at open idea you understand why we have inspiration consenting and evaluation the fates had it made sense you can see the logic behind that decision we all so value collaboration i talked about that earlier we have diverse people working together so we want them to collaborate and we build these network maps to show people what it means but you have to design for collaboration
1788.24,1802.85, just white for it to have to crowd funding systems tufthunter collaboration that's not bad thing you just have to be mindful of it so we deliberately designed for different units of engagement
1802.91,1806.96, and collaboration applauding something or commenting on something
1807.23,1820.85, any time it's kind of acquisition into the site and then deeper relationships round building on our new content and celebrating collaboration here all really important ways to drive collaboration
1821.24,1843.77, this is a good example actually just to show you so this guy lives in washington a guy called senor mazarion oarless he was contributes amazing stuff this was actually on the food production challenge to the queen's and challenge again he contributed the idea of iona help connect and in form to give you an idea around the surcoat on so this was his work you see here
1843.95,1857.6, this i find arises ned it pretty level pretty good level a granary is lovely to see and you can also see down on the right had built on this so these are all other concepts where people have taken his
1857.6,1860.63, my grated them into their own content
1860.75,1871.43, can see how i work did ransford now and then finally you can see the other type of collaboration which is commenting and pretty unbelievable the richness
1871.58,1890.69, people contributions they actually learn a huge amount from initially we didn't really kind of celebrate comments we didn't expect it to evolve but we reacted pretty quickly we even now allow things like a flood in comment because we saw people having conversation threads in the comments of behavior we didn't expect
1891.68,1943.64, and then final for just a share maintain a drum beat if you got to grow a community don't think there's no free lunch a lot people turn to this stuff because they think it's cheap for its easy it's hard work just catch up with a community manager lena he lives in new zealand where a lot of time just making sure that a drum by if you want to learn more about that incredibly difficult to give you an idea this is an open idea you can see at a mean atwater i just grabbed this not so long ago you can see just tweeting a huge amount to keep the bad going said and actually you know making sure that people continued stay interested with what's happening also if you guys are using open systems collaboration remember there is a whole world outside the platform and celebrate it if you think that you could control a community your history they rejected
1943.82,1962.39, we set a right all of the interesting emergence stuff we say a most we have no control over so one example of the amorous so these are pretty heavy uses there cataracted their own conversation groups that we kind of participate in but we had nothing to do with another i find inspiring
1962.45,1984.23, i sense given there's not one line or of line really any more it's all blended its people actually met on twitter fanatic and actually go to restaurants and me they have what they call thee up i've had them in new york washington san francisco people that have never met together but now they had a common interest in social good through this platform
1984.35,1995.36, again we choose not to go that traditional prices to granada to sound bites with everyone videoing because we want these emergent things to flourish
1996.17,2001.75, then the final coup was a celebrated the journey as well as the destination
2002.14,2007.81, for example crowd saucing sits you just celebrate the thing that pops out the other end
2007.87,2017.59, think about the journey and what it means think about the engagement it has the potential to create we readily post blogs where we celebrate just the small steps
2017.77,2020.2, can be incredibly impact ful
2020.41,2024.52, and finally most you know final to most importantly
2024.55,2035.26, how impact by accounts uniting around wanting positive impact so we have to show it where we can we have a team in generate moment actually prototyping
2035.47,2052.99, at the solution of a toilet was actually developed on the side will set a bright that almost more than getting a new challenge is unbelievably important and we've been saturating impact actually over the last forty eight hours in workshops to refine a lot of the concepts from the queensland challenge
2054.04,2073.9, so exciting to see kind of in this case local farmers politicians entrepreneurs students get together around a common man build out these ideas and turn them into quick actionable steps rather than just the rising and trying to change the world all at once from the macro level
2074.23,2103.87, and the final one i went into shakin of a heart warming story for me was her idolatra loving story save you of words in traditional website tight businesses your tortha lurkers so a lurker is some one that basically just so watches from the sidelines of the side doesn't want to commit probably is an athletic one you d say that interested in the sight one thing happened at the end of last year that completely changed my perspective
2103.99,2111.19, whether lurkers are important and it was a christmas card regard from a lady colburne criminals
2111.46,2118.18, i looked at prisoner contributed to the sight she had registered but she had not even applauded something
2118.78,2124.57, i would said look not interested how do we convert her and she sent this hand drawn christmas card
2125.17,2128.8, the effort she put into this told me that she was ache
2128.89,2134.77, engaged in the topic and reminded me that actually the lurker sometimes have a lot of the power
2135.22,2139.03, and of strata a lot the value
2139.12,2164.11, so as the questions i asked but you can see that some systematic order and its interesting how little technology features in it technologies and enable the real question is what you want to achieve and whose able of achieving thank you very much these are my details thank you
2166.06,2172.0, antonius one question of the fort at woes this leave the notion
2172.36,2189.67, intellectual property the collaborative world of innovation is very different from the idea of the inventor the idea and the prophet the comes from the idea this blows it away completely doesn't it in so i don't think it necessary blaitiere value lives i think we
2189.88,2214.6, three you know a lot of the last hundred years and placed a lot of value in ideas and one of the things that we've learned is actually ideas given technology are almost commoditie now i start a couple of businesses and with both of them people of consistently said to me afterwards i had the idea i had that idea every one has access to all ideas and if you believe that's true then you know the values in execution
2214.81,2217.06, if the value is an execution
2217.09,2238.51, to miss it that it doesn't matter if some of the traditional defense of intellectual property collapses away and i think we see palante software industry which is the leading indicator of this open source the fascinating example where the value is about creating echo systems and also creative commons as an example where you kind of see people
2238.54,2316.9, in moving up malignities way without collapsing the system as exceptions to the rule but i think it's kind of a net positive that we move away from that defensive thinking i callate some questions or comments from the floor because there must surely be soon feedback do we have some one with a microphone at all or will people just yell from we do help microphone on the side i was thinking the music industries a classic industry is in it that moved from that old paradigm of the bergantin signing up the individual artist to now basically the artist establishing the on website getting their music out there having control really over their own destiny and the audience by dispensing example music industry was produced so the value is in the sea day for the smart companies of realized that the can't contain piracy you have to work with it so you look for a dacent values a lot the money's moved to live even which he expect a lot the money's moved to systems that you have here i think factoryville taken the most expensive bear of the music industry which was artisan repertoire
2317.08,2323.2, searching for alan and they've totally democratized it they've even gone further they get all eustace
2323.65,2377.89, by voting to say what we want to buy so they've turned a cost to a revenue extraordinary models so we see i find it inspiring the music industry actually and i think publishing will follow many of the things we've seen in terms of the evolution so anyway i'm agoin to get you pointed out here you insulted by time or the instigator to finally get a result that's the way i read your message people come up with the idea in your share it right through to product or the success whichever way he liked to believe it till onishishin to the hawk garment and a year ago or i propitiated time i did there was to be a department of ideas as part of the title government
2378.55,2432.52, the selenite register alliteration invention or whatever which is a long line of what your sin and the ordering that the person would get the recognition of having in the register and if alternately others want to take it up farebrothers and if it ultimately is developed will then they spriteliness government came in that the government would give protection so you could say that whether it's an invention or some other way so people get rewards in defence some people might like money but the article better garment doesn't matter doesn't have to be in our invention but the registration of the idea leads to recognition
2432.67,2502.09, and that man seagod chance the idea be adopted because others will build one as exactly as what you said there and ultimately the successful come from the adoption of the idea whether it's an invention or whatever what's your comedians it you are ahead of us and turn of the philosophy or the like to things in what you said the first is in a detrition patent right we just talked about is the idea that you can kind of ring fence intellectual property and a lot of the incentives are actually not to you have what you call submarine patents where people hide their ideas unbelievable their hiding their ideas in case someone else uses it so that they can is kind of like piracy to me just it shocking a proves allied him your interpretation your evolution of the idea of traditional patents as you did two things you give some recognition without promising the world because if you promise the world to invent or nothing ever happens because they are over inflated ideas of how much an idea worth and secondly what shall i love about what you were saying which still doesn't happen enough is you creation market
2502.18,2533.77, you actually sharing ideas so they're accessible and we don't have enough of that either if you look at the patent office blow by the sure you've looked at patents in the past there unbelievably long complex things as an inaccessible system to day so i think if we all kind of shared more ideas and were open about more ideas similar to what you see an open source now with soft were the world of be bad place so kind of a play for thinking about it before i certainly the head of the cove will dear
2534.22,2542.32, hello i assassinated about how you have set this up as an online for a moistly on but they say
2542.32,2553.36, people say that there's a loss of conversation and the art of conversation i was just wondering if you see a social loss to these conversations being made online
2553.42,2563.11, i say is a great question i don't think they're better or worse i just think their different and i think we have to eat setter actually
2563.41,2566.26, i think ability to converse
2566.32,2598.48, been constrained by technology because technology hasn't really understood it or be adapted fully to it i think we see that changing to a couple of stories just to bring that to life met someone at intention go whose daughter was a year old in the states and he said her home bill over a year so over a month was one minute a voice calls and six thousand text messages so i just have to accept that there you know people using these technologies of finding new ways to communicate
2598.51,2617.71, did it with the telegraph we found ways of actually shortening speech so that the telegraph was a useful tool the same happening with the internet is different not necessarily better or worse and i kind of celebrate that the thing that scares me is how many clients i may who stop their staff using face burk
2617.98,2625.51, using twitter using basely all the tools that enable you to build these muscles to operate in this new economy
2625.72,2639.4, i necessarily think is better or worse i just think it's perhaps an evolution of conversation and in excited by new technology actually facilitating it an exciting new ways like video sky
2639.55,2652.42, an unbeliever a noble of the sort beneficial i contact the papalini to say exciting to watch vallot lots of potential for it in proof other
2653.23,2655.0, gentlemen of the back
2655.03,2661.72, talking about the evaluation says in the posture you had upon the impersonation before
2661.72,2695.5, what is your feeling with regard to whether it should be a democratic evaluation has or not like whether you should be recognizing that somebody with a deep strength in a field or somebody who is a new comer inanities have the same amount of say when it comes to evaluating ideas absolutely racking quest we wrestled with this load and the answer i think is it depends entirely on the question that if you resist
2695.8,2766.3, it probably wouldn't use the wisdom of the craters you know if you can and i think actually there's more potential to use the wisdom of the crowd if you smartly shape the evaluation criteria or one of the things we learn earlier on is the actual people have a disproportionate bias to beautiful beautifully presented stuff kind of a risk in the system so you can have a good idea badly presented a bad idea beautifully present presented and people have a natural son comitia of the latter so one of the things we've tried to do is able full fully free for evaluation questions so that we can help shape people thinking so be great if you actually participated on the side when we switch to a valuation which will happen very shortly in a couple of weeks for the queens and challenge and you'll see that we let out a series firewood ask every one to evaluate every thing were reducing the number to evaluate it just be too much work and then we're asking people to evaluate against specific criteria that we thought quite long and hard about just to make sure that where kind of judging for the right reasons rather than know the estates of the stuff that might matter less
2766.48,2767.98, question
2768.85,2779.83, so open ideo an open platform like if we have a website that we actually want or generate ideas from and have collaborators we oppose it baroness em but if you want to look into your uses
2779.92,2827.53, a facility for that to have a idiomatically linking into what you've got yes i we say and apis basically the ability to plug out o sight into open ideas enables you to smooth transitions between the two that it it means a heap of different stuff and were developing versions of it so were starting initially the kind of low hanging fruit for us is to enable people to pull a feed of all of the date of that comes from open ideas they can be created about it were some lovely date of vigilias early interpretations of this the next level of complexity i think you're referring to it as she when we saw a deep root and operer example people could you know drop their own challenge into open idea
2827.62,2853.27, excited about that the potential of that we just have a kind of duty to account to be very careful about how we do it so what you will see is that as we move to explore new apis will do it in a really sensitive way and we'll make sure we learn as quickly as we can i find it quite hard to imagine a system where we enable every one to throw anything at the community because they just get overwhelmed
2853.78,2855.88, that makes sense
2856.15,2881.86, are you the next man iceberg or are you would dematerialising an i think there's amazing potential to shape and create and i was just blindway by just some of the demonstrations that you had on the queensland situation about food and i just is incredible if you can
2881.86,2895.63, why edward the soothing if i grow from a small two very huge take this concept to the world then that fascinating power in a notice
2895.96,2919.66, i think it's interesting because a slight difference is i'm excited about these systems in which the power doesn't reside with any individual whereas any face books an incredibly smart system made probably exercise huge degree of control so we probably would define what we're doing more as about so defining the playing field
2920.05,2940.21, we enable the convent not just a sarcelle their roles on the team but also at times to soothing the rules of the game so we probably don't exercise the level of control in a very different matting they're both net positives and we don't know where it gooeeays
2940.72,2948.82, thank you for your presentation day tom i'm just interested in the political flout or to the sense that
2949.48,2954.79, we keep going to crowd souring in the notion of a political position
2955.0,2974.47, having to a future with rather than the old paradigm of the radicals and the conservatives began to have whatever a particular group of people at the side of this is the way we do it now because this is what the community wants rather than the politicians having a sense of this is what i stand for this is we are going
2975.31,2991.99, i think it's it's basically a great question i resteth this and i don't think again there's a right or wrong answer is pretended in the media industry and actually the overlaps with politics enormously because of the power of media in politics
2992.62,3000.3, i think i think actually were kind of the moment and inflection point which is quite healthy where we have a bit of both
3000.72,3002.55, question is you know
3002.58,3012.69, in opinions or idea content like news i think is completely commodities the value is in curration
3012.78,3015.75, in the way you present ideas
3016.14,3020.73, all the way you package the ideas and it's the way you execute the ideas
3021.21,3066.18, you believe fundamentally that's the case which i do which is why i kind of applauded the huffington post i trow the new york times i have flowed all of it i think you know i apparitions i excited about the transparency that this has the potential to create and the fact that ache it will a kind of brings every one to a critical mass of knowledge potentially whereby people are judged better and potentially the world is more meritorious some scary scenarios where you get kind of radicalism fostered on line you know we seeing potentially elements of that with algiers to let themselves into groups and they never see anything else i think it's kind of happen through human history
3066.72,3107.85, the human history we've been constrained by the dunbar number which is the people in a social network that we can remember effectively which the table if you are born into a radical group at that time by you know the certain religious groups that were seen in the states around the world where they bring kids up through that i same experience so i don't think the allatoona great access to make sure those in check as best we can
3108.93,3122.4, i think we're going to have to wrap this because we're right on the notorious twenty more questions but will you please said join me and giving a hand to tom in
3123.63,3129.33, this is big ideas from the arc
