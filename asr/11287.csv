5.16,7.77, in there the end of our week
8.07,10.23, will retire sunday
10.26,14.46, story of jesus today side is the resurrection
14.7,22.32, and we talked about the crucifixion of jesus and how he died on a terrible terrible cross
22.74,25.86, pay the price for your sin and the pay the price
26.13,30.84, and after he died jesus was taken down from the cross
30.9,32.94, he was buried in a tomb
33.48,37.29, we know that's not how the story of jesus in
37.89,39.72, a saviour
39.84,41.7, not save any one
43.11,44.67, fact that
46.11,48.15, from the dead is
48.36,53.91, support and to the gospel message the fact that jesus styrofoam sent
54.24,55.62, resurrection
55.77,59.34, the very heart of christianity
60.09,61.98, resurrection is the proof
62.07,65.85, exactly who he said he is
66.21,67.38, so
67.59,76.29, those who choose to follow him and to put their trust in him will find themselves in a growing relationship which is as christ
76.68,81.84, resurrection is also proof that jesus will come again and he will judge
81.84,84.69, world jesus is coming back
85.59,87.99, nobody knows when
88.62,90.18, you need to be ready
90.51,94.2, his coming since the resurrection
94.32,98.43, an essential part an important part of the story of jesus it came
98.43,101.64, under attack immediately by the enemy
102.27,106.83, attack on the truth of the resurrection was a series of lies
107.73,109.05, first love
109.11,111.24, that the disciples came and
111.45,114.27, the body of jesus away from the tomb
114.9,117.78, matthew chapter verse
118.29,121.83, the women were on their way some of the guards went into the city
121.98,125.64, and reported to the chief priest everything that had happened
126.42,130.53, the chief priest had met with the elders and devised the plan
130.92,134.58, gave the soldiers a large sum of money telling them
134.61,137.91, to say his disciples came during the night
138.09,142.02, stole him away while we were asleep
142.56,144.99, if this report gets to the governor
145.23,148.2, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
148.77,150.84, the soldiers took the money
151.2,153.12, as they were instructed
153.63,159.87, this story has been widely circulated among the jews to this very
160.68,162.18, this 
162.18,166.92, full of holes the tomb of jesus was very carefully guarded
167.1,169.89, have been possible for the scared the cables
169.98,174.3, overpower the guard rolled the huge stone on the way and still
174.48,183.42, body of jesus and other line that was spread around was that jesus never died that he was just unconscious when they put him in the tomb
184.14,186.42, this is also full of holes
187.02,192.09, it confirmed with a centurion that jesus in fact was dead
192.57,198.54, roman soldiers who broke the legs of the other two thieves confirmed that jesus
198.57,199.68, the
200.04,203.25, all of the blood loss in his whipping
203.4,207.72, the crucifixion that would have been possible for him just a wake up in the tomb
208.02,210.87, the stone away and walk out
211.77,213.12, these are nothing
213.54,214.59, i
215.04,217.74, truth is that jesus died
218.22,220.29, on the third day he rose
222.06,224.94, everything that we as christians
225.36,230.7, believe it is based on the truth that jesus died for our sin and he rose again from the dead
231.15,233.7, there were many witnesses
233.85,240.0, the resurrection jesus first appeared the mary magdalen and then to the other women
240.24,241.77, he was seen by the
241.77,248.04, on the way to amass jesus appeared to peter in his half brother james
248.13,250.68, he appeared to the apostles
251.1,256.53, as was not with him a week later he appeared again to the apostles for thomas
256.92,258.27, as a
258.72,273.0, appeared to seven of the apostles as they fished in the lake of sagallo he appeared several times to the apostles before he went back to heaven and he talked them and instructed them how they would carry off their ministry after he was gone
273.36,278.31, christ was seen by over five hundred people at one time
279.06,286.89, the believer saw that jesus really was alive had completely changed their lives
287.28,288.93, is the story
288.93,293.55, the resurrection of jesus mark chapter sixteen a verse one
294.3,296.07, the sabbath was over
296.19,299.55, magdalen mary the mother james and salome
299.64,303.57, so that they might go to a noisy
304.14,307.59, very early on the first day of the week just after sunrise
307.65,309.99, on their way to the tomb
310.26,312.03, and they asked each other
312.33,316.14, will roll the stone away from the entrance
316.17,318.0, the tone
318.6,323.31, book of mark is one of my favorite gospels because he don't mess around
323.4,328.44, a man what he says and he says what he means and he doesn't waste words
328.77,330.24, i admire the
330.72,340.26, interesting in his writing about the resurrection of jesus and chapter fifteen and sixteen that he mentions the name of these three women
340.26,342.54, different times
342.93,346.59, mark riding to wisely i said it once and i minute
346.65,347.85, i said it
348.36,350.94, why the theory pete himself
350.97,352.98, as with the names
353.19,354.27, the women
354.51,356.4, scholars think
356.49,362.61, mark was going to great pains to let us know that he was just not recording a legend
362.73,366.42, these were actual true historical
368.13,369.48, the culture
369.75,380.7, that time if he was making this story up about jesus rising from the dead mark would have never used the names of women as the witnesses to back up his story
380.73,386.67, the fact that he listed the names of these women as witnesses to the story proves
386.76,389.22, the story must be true
389.61,398.43, ladies were led when mark wrote this account and people had any doubts they could go ask them exactly what they saw and exactly what they heard
398.61,402.81, this is what they experienced mark sixteen o three
403.56,405.0, at each other
405.12,408.36, who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb
408.84,410.37, when they looked up
410.82,414.51, so that the stone which was very large had been rolled away
414.84,422.13, as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed
422.64,424.26, alarmed he said
424.5,427.8, looking for jesus the nazarene who was crucified
428.1,429.75, he has risen
430.05,431.22, not here
431.49,433.5, the place where they laid him
433.89,436.5, tell us the cycles and peter
436.68,440.46, go ahead of you in the galere you will see him
441.6,443.4, he told you
444.24,445.38, i
445.59,448.14, did not come to the tomb
448.14,449.79, expecting to find
451.38,453.3, strange when you think about it
453.51,456.51, how many times had jesus told them
456.78,458.4, he would 
458.7,461.28, the third day he would rise
461.34,464.82, the dead he told them in mark chapter eight
465.33,472.59, he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders the chief priest
472.74,474.51, the teachers of the law
474.72,478.68, he must be killed and after three days rise again
478.8,481.02, spoke plainly
481.14,482.16, about this
482.73,484.26, just in case
484.35,485.88, they weren't listening
485.91,489.18, they didn't understand he told them again and chapter nine
490.11,492.0, when his disciples
492.06,497.73, he said to them the son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men
497.88,499.65, will kill him
499.86,501.69, and after three days
501.72,503.31, he will rise
503.64,505.98, just in case they weren't listening
506.01,509.79, they didn't understand he told them again in chapter ten
510.18,515.25, and again he took the lad and told them what was going to happen to him
515.58,530.19, we are going up to jerusalem he said and the son of man will be delivered over to the chief priest and the teachers of the law they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the gentiles who will mock him
530.22,534.42, spit on him and flog him and kill him
534.96,536.49, days later
536.73,537.66, he
537.69,538.62, will
540.42,542.91, remember that mark's writing style is
543.03,550.92, always direct and to the point and since he quoted jesus three times saying the same thing jesus must have said this
551.1,553.89, over and over again
554.07,555.93, again this same strange
556.26,560.37, jesus clearly explained to them that he was going to die
560.7,567.06, that on the third day he would rise from the dead then should we see the icicles
567.24,574.59, excited anticipation gathered at the tomb very early in the morning on the third day
575.1,577.02, none of the disciples
577.44,578.43, there
578.7,581.85, would now find at least one disciple
581.91,583.26, believe
583.62,585.51, would remember
586.08,587.52, ladies were there
587.82,591.42, they were there to anoint a dead body
591.78,594.81, no one expected
595.11,596.49, resurrection
597.15,599.76, remember what the angel said to them
601.26,608.94, the same peter he's going ahead of you and the gaily there you will see him just as he told you
609.24,612.75, even the angel had remind them that jesus
612.75,619.29, said a sometimes i get a lot of concern on sunday morning about if any of your listening
621.24,622.56, people
623.52,625.32, it jesus
626.13,628.14, i don't have a prayer
629.82,630.93, again
631.29,634.38, sure that this story is true
634.98,639.66, mark is going to make something up he would never make up a story
639.69,640.68, this
641.31,645.06, the resurrection was as hard for the disciples to accept
645.21,648.09, the resurrection is for people to day
650.13,654.12, resurrection of jesus was a miracle
654.87,659.76, the god we serve is a miracle working god
660.54,662.16, for whatever reason
662.82,664.14, yes
664.26,665.55, not believe
666.06,670.35, angel said but go tell his disciples and
672.03,675.96, would the angel make a distinction between the other disciples
676.41,679.8, peter remember there are disciples now to 
679.86,681.78, had taken his own life
682.65,685.32, why was there a distinction between peter
685.47,691.68, and the others we know that all the disciples deserted jesus when he was arrested
692.4,693.93, it was peter
694.2,699.24, denied that he even knew jesus he denied him publicly and at once
699.78,702.21, twice but three times
702.45,706.65, in the same night and peter knew that jesus knew
706.98,708.24, he had done
709.02,710.73, fell off
711.33,714.6, the angel made the distinction between peter
714.84,720.69, the other disciples jesus wanted to make sure that peter knew that he was all ready
722.34,724.26, that peter was welcome
724.41,726.39, the inner circle of jesus
726.81,733.23, reminds us that there is nothing we can do there is nothing
733.65,734.73, and
735.06,737.22, beyond god's grace
738.0,741.81, god's forgiveness he accepts you
742.17,743.97, he loves you
744.57,746.94, just the way you are
747.84,750.93, pick up the story and luke chapter 
751.29,759.42, while they were still talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you
760.14,763.89, they were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost
764.58,766.95, he said that they who are you troubled
767.58,769.47, no doubt rise
769.71,771.06, in your mind
771.36,779.64, you expect that the cipher a party celebrating the fact that jesus was alive but instead the scared
779.88,780.84, the
781.83,783.75, were happening so quickly
783.99,791.43, i seemed to catch them unprepared even though jesus had told them over and over again exactly
791.67,792.87, what happened
793.38,796.83, as the condition of their hearts
797.07,798.57, the problem
802.02,809.1, jesus appeared to the eleven as they were eating he rebuked them for their lack of faith
809.28,814.05, and they are stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after
814.23,815.76, he had risen
816.3,819.03, he was trying to settle them down and
819.15,824.49, their fears and they did this by giving them a blessing jesus said peace
824.7,825.87, with you
826.89,829.62, because of what jesus died on the cross
829.62,834.9, because he rose again from the dead all people can now have peace with god
835.2,839.55, they put their faith and trust in his son jesus christ
840.42,852.33, i also tried to calm them down by showing them his hands and his feet or thirty nine look at my hands and my feet it is i myself touch me and see
852.57,857.82, ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see i have
858.09,859.71, when he had said this
860.01,862.2, he showed them his hands
864.12,865.95, mark from the cross
866.31,870.06, still be seen even on jesus's glorified body
870.45,873.0, maybe they'll be there and it turned the don't know
873.75,879.36, i wanted them to know that they were not seeing a ghost that he was really there
879.45,887.22, how a body of flesh and bones can walk through walls and appear and disappear instantly
887.37,889.41, too much information
889.41,891.54, our human understanding
891.57,894.75, but we know that jesus did those things
894.93,896.73, after he arose
896.76,897.93, i think
898.14,900.06, we believe that it's true
900.42,902.1, and that it really happened
904.35,906.72, and while they still did not believe it
907.08,908.7, cause of joy
909.03,910.11, amazement
910.74,915.54, have you ever been told something that you just knew was too good to be true
915.69,919.62, we all heard the saying if it sounds too good to be true
919.98,921.6, probably is
922.47,923.76, many of us
923.88,925.44, been tricked
925.68,931.17, the seed and lied to so many times that it's hard for us to trust
932.19,935.07, that's where the disciples were
935.28,939.93, they were just so blown away but what was happening they couldn't take it all in
940.08,948.51, theseus even eight with them to prove that he was real first forty one he asked them do you have anything here to eat
948.72,953.58, they gave him a piece of broiled fish he took it and aided in their presence
953.91,955.92, i said touch me
956.19,963.78, see i was telling them i am real i am alive i am really here you can trust me
964.17,965.67, can believe
965.73,972.93, to day first forty four he said to them this is what i told you while i was still with you
973.44,977.67, everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of moses
977.85,979.02, profits
979.17,980.49, the song
980.7,983.73, then he opened their minds
984.3,986.28, they can understand
986.64,987.9, scripture
988.14,994.35, another way that jesus was trying to bring them peace and comfort with through the word of god
994.5,1002.45, open their minds so they could understand the scriptures i pray that prayer all the time jesus opened my mind
1002.87,1005.39, i can understand the scriptures
1007.04,1009.26, we cannot touch
1009.29,1013.88, feel the lord jesus but we can put our faith in the word of god
1014.06,1015.44, he is a real
1015.86,1022.43, like the word of god increased the faith of the disciples the word can increase our faith to
1022.97,1035.78, not only help them understand the law the prophets and the psalms but he also reminded of all the things and he had talked them and how all of this story now fits together
1035.99,1040.7, can you imagine how amazing it would be to sit at the feet of jesus
1040.7,1042.23, he was teaching
1042.23,1043.61, disciples
1045.83,1047.12, told them
1047.33,1051.26, what is written the masai will suffer
1051.26,1054.77, rise from the dead on the third day
1054.98,1057.17, even so slowly
1057.32,1061.76, i began to understand why he had to suffer
1062.18,1070.58, why he had to die and how the cross and the resurrection are all part of the promise of the kingdom of god
1070.64,1073.1, it all makes perfect sense
1073.19,1075.14, god gives us
1075.32,1076.79, understanding
1077.15,1085.13, why people who don't know the lord can understand the things of god because their eyes are shut
1085.7,1091.73, their ears are closed but thank god for this truth to day
1091.88,1093.65, the open their minds
1094.25,1096.17, they could understand
1096.23,1097.49, it
1097.64,1105.35, and then everything begins to come together for his glory to day we can know that jesus rose from the bed
1105.56,1107.45, as the tomb
1107.72,1108.8, empty
1109.13,1119.06, because of the many eye witnesses but cause of the amazing life change that happened in the lives of his followers
1119.42,1130.25, how else can you explain a bunch of run and hide cowardly disciples becoming strong bold men of the faith
1130.34,1139.58, who put their life on the line for the message that jesus is lord of all and were willing to die a martyr's death to proclaim
1140.63,1141.8, your name
1142.13,1145.82, there is no other explanation none other
1146.21,1147.59, the tomb
1150.05,1153.92, what makes the story of jesus different from any other story
1154.52,1158.21, amazing story is completely
1162.17,1164.81, a little boy named philip who was
1165.29,1167.06, with down
1167.12,1168.2, some
1168.53,1170.03, a nice kid
1170.12,1171.59, same happy
1172.01,1175.58, he was aware of the differences between himself
1175.88,1177.38, and the other children
1177.95,1179.69, went to his
1179.75,1182.78, the children's ministry every week
1182.99,1187.37, he was in the third grade small group of nine other
1187.4,1188.66, old
1189.26,1191.18, with his differences
1191.48,1193.61, was not easily accepted
1194.09,1201.56, a small group leader was sensitive to this and he tried to help the group of eight year old love each other as best he could
1201.92,1205.4, still fill up many times was left out
1205.49,1209.45, what in the part of the group he didn't choose to be different
1209.57,1211.07, just as
1211.58,1213.65, that's the way things were
1213.89,1218.33, his small group leader had a creative idea on easter sunday
1218.57,1221.81, he had these ten plastic eggs
1221.84,1223.94, you could screw open
1224.87,1227.63, kids were excited when he gave each one of them
1227.96,1235.58, plastic age there are silent was for each child to go outside find a symbol of new life
1235.58,1239.15, and put it inside the plastic egg and then bring it
1239.36,1240.59, inside
