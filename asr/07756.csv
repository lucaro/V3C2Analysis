8.01,24.09, well are challenge quite simply is a competition where people are challenged to build a car pawed by nothing more than the sun and drive it across the whole width of australia from gaining the north to
24.12,31.92, in the south of this one of little over three thousand kilometers across the centre of this fantastic land
33.48,51.75, is a very simple proposition however we know from roeper and from those teams to come and try it that sir it is a huge logistical exercise beyond that of building the car in fact well well uncle the famous european astronaut
51.75,65.94, faculty advisor to the five times well champion team none describes the logistical challenge of staging a well seachange campaign equal to that of planning a space mission
66.42,81.21, whether that's true or not it really not for me to say but i can certainly say that it is a fantastic journey it is a fantastic opportunity to be part of the vast australian or back that too many of us don't get to see
81.57,109.62, the history of the event it was born why back in the s when there was a political crisis which stopped the tankers stopped the tankers and stopped the oil flowing and he caused a huge political huge social upheaval in the western world he will cure and follower a letter of petrol and the prices went up five times in the matter of six weeks
109.62,122.16, and you can do your own sum now to say well if in the next six weeks petal cost five times that which it does now would that have an impact on the social structure of our cities
122.91,131.52, one of the outcomes of that crisis in the eyes was that motor racing was band it was not felt that it was a
131.52,154.08, a suitable use for the precious resource in driving racing cups and hand fell strip and a few others satananda and we do and hands came up with the notion that well it shouldn't be about how fast seeking go should be a but more about how far we can go how far can we go on how little energy
154.56,165.93, that really was the first thought of what then became the world seachange and hand sinecures and drivers made of his built a
165.93,190.38, purely soledad was called the quiet achiever and it ran from perth to sidney in anemometer something of that nature and took about days to complete that journey but it was an inspiration it was inspiration for others and an inspiration for hands to start the first world salechan from going adelaide which ran in nineteen eighty seven
191.76,194.49, manufacturers got behind
194.49,206.61, that first event solar was going to be a magic magic ingredients and fix all the world's problems in terms of their power
206.61,213.3, and people like general motors came to the party put a lot of money behind that in creating a car
213.33,239.7, called the sunrise which was the first participate that journey it one quite convincingly the nineteen eighty seven event or marriage of a little undeceitful islamites an air as an average but it was an absolute inspiration to the rest of the world and it became an yoorgin motors of unstaggering capabilities for a number of years and understand that cow was exhibited or was the feature of
239.7,244.95, ambitions around the world and something like two occasions
245.13,251.01, and if you think about what sort of dollars calamaries put into their major exhibitions
251.01,254.55, it was a pretty good investment in the first place
255.21,269.19, where we go now is that sir the world at craves not really the great great achievement of hope over adversity that it once was
269.19,275.31, his pretty good most teams certainly most well resource teams can pretty much reckon on finishing
275.31,279.69, the events within the time given when we run over six days
280.89,293.58, aspect of the event is that the event is run in the single stone that is once the flag is dropped into it each tamers on its own and goes as far as it can each day until five o'clock at night
294.57,312.09, this is easy to easier to comprehend if we look at the check points along the road where the first check point in catherine is open for three hours and the last check point in polycaste is open for three days such is the spread of teams between the super stars food
312.09,325.5, endeavour to finish the event in little over four days and those who perhaps he don't have the best resources or the best of luck oninterestin who can take up to six days to to be part of the event
326.31,335.49, aspects is that the points close at a time to reflect their minimum speed that people are required to achieve to stay in the immense
335.55,344.76, rather than captain the shoulder at that point and send them home we ask them to put their car on the trailer and catch up a little bit and put their corbeck on the road
344.79,356.22, to maximize their maximize their exposure to the events of meister enjoyment of driving the car that ever would have spent so long building actually on the road
357.6,380.25, terms of this year's event in two thousand and eleven there are some forty two teams who have registered representing twenty one different countries around the world which is an impressive spread of international participation and certainly shows how much and how well this seventy thought of around the world
381.0,383.67, events
383.82,401.37, will be strained on a number of occasions and from this very man here in the arias this will become even headquarters and for the first time all the cars will be fitted with satiating vices which we will say on the big screen behind me
403.08,408.69, take to win the world caracalla he takes the termination
408.75,417.39, there are those who have done extremely well with less than the very very best technologies it's not just about the big dollars and buying the best of everything
417.48,428.25, in many ways it is about being the best that you can possibly be and every step of the game and it is about having a dream and pursuing that train
428.43,442.17, and i'm sure that those of you who want to follow the world seachange and take part in the curriculum will find that it is a fascinating and fantastic subject
445.68,451.32, simpson and i am one of the two drivers for the aurora vehicle association
451.44,456.72, i am also the chairman of the assertion is as well
457.56,461.4, i guess i should start by talking about 
461.43,462.9, itself
463.41,466.56, unlike most teams involved in the world solar challenge
466.56,470.7, is not affiliated with the one university
470.97,482.31, other school organization aurora is an independent all volunteer organization based in elberthal and were dedicated to promoting sustainable mobility
482.7,487.35, through the public demonstration of vehicles of our own manufacturing
489.3,496.41, so while we do have some students on our ten many of our team members
496.44,507.36, professionals or retires all sharing a common vision about sustainable ability and a positive future for trial
508.53,515.07, one of the things you might notice is that my accent is not so and
515.13,517.83, there's an interesting story behind that
517.83,520.17, i guess you could say i am a product
520.23,522.51, the gym on record
522.72,524.4, after they won
524.52,532.95, challenge they elected not to continue racing but to do an educational outreach program in america
533.49,536.43, and i was a beneficiary of that
537.0,538.68, went to 
538.8,551.73, public school like many other people do in america and the sun racer program was integrated directly into the curriculum in that school and that's where my interest in soliciting started
553.17,555.84, me to do is to think that
556.77,559.17, and chris spoke of a dream while
559.32,561.18, i saw a poster of
561.3,563.88, crossing the australian back
563.91,565.77, and when i read
565.89,574.23, i thought well that's a pretty neat little space ship driving the cross bars and someone had to point out to me that that was actually a car and that was actually a stralian that's the color of the
574.35,577.17, of the wonderful fact that we have here
577.29,580.26, and from that point on it said that's what i want to do
581.07,584.79, so it took a number of years but i ended up
585.18,586.89, university of michigan
587.19,589.59, which is a powerhouse in arising
590.07,600.03, and ended up participating in their program winning the american race there and coming down to a strain the early from there
600.09,601.86, i fell in love with the place
602.1,605.25, a couple of years ago i had the opportunity to move to australia
605.82,613.71, and continued my solar car racing with the revelation some people of question well why produce such a thing
613.89,616.11, number one i believe in the program 
616.44,618.81, o me to follow a dream
619.08,625.47, to be successful in my chosen profession which is car testing for the ford motor company
627.18,630.09, it also told me taught me is
631.41,634.5, i really found out about what i'm good at
634.68,636.48, no i'm not so good a
636.69,639.39, challenged me to be a better person
639.69,643.98, and one of the things that i think people can take away from the event
645.99,647.43, really figure out
647.67,652.71, the sort of major challenges in your life and the major adventures is who you rehearse
654.0,655.32, and
655.89,657.78, i think one of the unique things
657.96,659.28, about the event
661.05,669.99, so why open and you've got the wide open landscape got wide open competition you have the team with millions of dollars of budgets and you've got
670.08,676.74, don't have so much now but you're all in a shared experience when you come out at the end as a different person and improved person
679.56,680.52, i think
680.7,682.05, about the 
682.23,683.97, association with god
685.62,690.39, interesting mix of people that you wouldn't get necessarily at a university program
690.54,693.42, and one of the things that i encourage
693.42,699.12, participating in any of these sorts of educational events whether it's the solar school program
699.15,703.44, or whether it's the model fuller or even the world to challenge itself
703.56,705.15, that it's not
705.33,710.79, most experienced or the senior or the or the professional people on
710.79,712.59, organization on your team
713.1,714.18, the quiet
714.48,717.27, person in the corner that often comes over the best
717.63,718.77, idea
718.77,720.0, but
720.15,721.5, in fact this morning
721.62,724.17, during the media launch for the world to challenge
725.28,729.66, quiet young students who jested that perhaps older energy could be used to power
729.66,731.28, as for your computer
732.9,737.1, really cool because if you read into what
737.31,740.64, certain computer company that's very hot right now and
740.7,743.37, make very interesting personal computers
743.67,745.17, trying to patent
745.2,746.82, ornery
746.94,751.23, her laptop computers imbedded in the screen and better in the back and better than the keyboard
752.01,754.92, one shy young person
755.76,760.5, come up with the same idea that the powerhouse industrial design team
760.98,762.18, particular
762.99,766.05, mix popular computers
768.45,770.67, really encourage people to
771.96,776.85, this program or in their every day school and verses to really think outside the box
777.3,778.86, and i think the
780.0,781.62, whether it's
781.89,787.23, racing developing a new technology becoming a surgeon
787.32,788.88, he corner
789.87,792.36, you really believe in what you do and you
792.63,794.94, pursuit with passion
795.03,796.17, i happen
797.34,798.6, i think
800.28,809.97, i think that really comes out in the race people talk a lot about the technology and the or the dollars or the winning or the losing were making it to adulate or not 
810.39,813.03, they're also a lot of personal stories that we can
813.06,814.47, the events
814.59,820.5, about people growing and sharing in suffering and winning and therein
824.82,836.43, excellent thank you very much and will ask priscilla to come and join us again on the stage and will take some questions from the audience
841.41,842.94, the
843.0,845.31, these questions we have
852.21,866.52, is about new technologies that have come out of the world solange can either of you give us a bit of a description about some new technologies that have come out from the technology that developed in this race
867.63,881.43, my stop there's lots and lots of stories come out but there's also lots of things that we don't get to hear about but one of the things that we try and go to tea out these things is to put up an innovation and ward to encourage the teams
883.05,889.56, my presentation to a scientific faculty about some of the things that have spun out from what they do
890.43,894.87, as a couple of fine ones in the past so the
894.87,904.92, perhaps the most famous ones that when the people can relate to perhaps it comes from the stanford senator
904.95,929.4, where some of the guys were kicking around saying well it's all well building you salacacabia come from this and another of the guys who was part of that part of that group of bright young students went off and become a toilette
929.52,931.56, and he put his tolstoi
931.89,936.51, this into a out we might get practical electric car
936.54,957.57, and some of you i have heard of the tesla electric car which is a fantastic machine is probably one of the rich of most of the caneback but for those of us that have seen it and been lucky enough to drive with this beautiful car and that spaniel from the standard silicates ago
957.72,978.12, and back to the point that i was making about a renovation program one of the teams came up and said for our innovation award submission we want to show you what we've done that when acomin the checkpoint the critical datto the cares automatically down loaded
978.21,992.94, who asked pothible so that the guide can be left on diagnostic and fine to and when we come out of technical we can make those critical adjustments
993.24,1011.63, that piece of technology was brought up by ben and if you drive a new manorites stays renewed into the service play and go into chennevieres ception is they esalay a print out of the critical diagnostic of the care those things that
1011.63,1020.39, just there there are many many stories and as i said allison we get here about some retinue under is going to use
1021.08,1025.25, certainly tired technology has benefited from
1027.5,1029.48, the pacifically
1030.38,1040.91, the time you read newspapers or see television commercials about forming the one racing influencing tires that critter drive faster 
1041.21,1048.71, there are fires now that are available for most cars by the therefore cars or our
1048.74,1050.21, family an
1050.24,1056.15, feature of low rolling resistance technology which helps get you much better fuel economy
1057.17,1065.03, at one part company that was not done in a lab that was not done on the formula one race track that original technology was done
1065.03,1066.62, challenge
1066.89,1072.2, that's a really good example of direct technology transfer
1073.34,1074.24, from
1074.48,1077.33, back from being on the story highway
1077.36,1079.76, to your family carriage
1081.23,1087.8, excellent one i am quite latteiner that's very interesting i didn't realize that 
1088.07,1103.31, the question we have is in terms of the sole panels were familiar with samoans on our houses these days is there any difference between those sarpents and the ones that are on the cars that are being driven in say this race 
1105.17,1141.92, and extension of laboratories arteries essentially there is no difference so the silicon solicitate would have a mahasattvas really about dollars
1141.95,1181.52, the sides that developed to a the essential systems of the space lab and things like that they are different technology they don't have to the wavelets attention order to try and to level at level that situation we have in the regulations cut down the area of exotic technology compared to the area of normal terrestial technology
1181.52,1190.28, most of the cars that we will see in his years were salaaming are using exactly the same silicate ology that we would have one house
1191.63,1200.0, okay i know another question that comes through what is some of the main considerations when designing a soul occur
1201.62,1203.78, this sure
1205.28,1206.63, highway speeds
1207.77,1210.08, a majority of the energy that you use
1210.14,1212.72, is used to overcome
1212.72,1217.28, a force so the air moving around the outside of the car
1217.49,1219.02, those
1219.47,1226.19, the sort of things that make airplanes efficient are the same things or similar conceptual
1226.28,1230.0, the racing car so 
1230.24,1233.63, things that protruded or blood surfaces
1233.93,1237.38, really really not going to help you out so you'll see
1237.83,1244.07, most if not all the carver streamline shapes to try to be as small as possible
1244.1,1245.48, and
1245.66,1249.92, you can whether you look at it from any angle you want you don't want to see
1250.19,1256.97, boy are you see a smaller shape is possible whether the wind coming from the front were even from the side
1258.08,1260.0, the cars are so light
1260.51,1262.28, the wind can really
1262.43,1265.37, in the way the car behaved
1266.36,1269.81, startin terms of how much energy is as
1270.08,1273.83, after eric she probably also want to take a look at
1274.1,1276.86, how much energy new york car uses mechanically
1277.07,1284.66, mostly in the tires and in the suspension to a lot of the team spent a lot of time looking at the tires and trying to get the best one that they can
1284.66,1286.28, looking at
1286.43,1291.56, all of the mechanical bits in the cart wheel bearings or
1291.62,1294.95, things like that and then
1295.1,1298.19, beyond that there's also things like electrical efficiency
1299.09,1303.35, the sort of electrical system that you'd have been side of a solitary
1304.07,1306.44, have the best technology available
1307.4,1308.45, the
1308.54,1310.67, electrical system that you'd find
1310.7,1315.14, your demand electric car or you too prayed
1315.35,1317.45, that very same technology
1317.48,1319.37, and 
1320.87,1326.81, it's interesting if i may just add to that that the one thing that understood mention was the same
1327.26,1346.1, and this is really fundamental that if we are campaigning silentiarius
1346.19,1357.35, it doesn't need to get high against heartwise the energy but what it really underlies is that what the guards here on the world's most efficient electric cars
1357.56,1399.47, whether the electricity comes from silures that we carry around on the cow which is really not a practical proposition to plug in hybrid as pluggin reach argile hydrogen fuel cells which supplies electricity we are looking at the world's most efficient electric drive trains and the electronic controls it's certainly not something that recitation
1399.47,1460.52, it's one of those things that is confounded sales for many many years we look back through the history what went wrong with that one it was the monotheistic it's always the mercantilist fancy electronic but that seems to be less than less now the electromechanical fantastic and in many ways it is as we can see with andres people who are destined to deliver the technologies to successes and his undress doing now is a senior engineer for madcap
1460.64,1463.55, the products that we can go out and buy a share
1464.72,1470.6, i could well have teachers in our audience that are going to be teaching the future of
1470.66,1475.19, in electric cars and so on really an sure we are
1475.37,1486.8, and now people might think that we may be there some people are there who might think that the sun goes my case going to stop automatically that's not the case is 
1488.93,1499.79, but now because we have energy storage systems in the regulations for the world searching we have a nominal defined amount of energy
1500.03,1509.21, can be stored that his relative to the amount of energy that we would need to run a car across the entire route and that's one of the things that makes
1509.39,1515.54, well chillen different from any other side of carrion the world because
1515.54,1525.56, initial concert going back to entiers was that if one killican take fifty hours to drive across
1525.65,1539.75, to drive across the country ten percent of that is five kilowatt hours and that's a nominal number to be limited to energy and the way that we control that is by looking at the battery technology
1539.84,1577.28, and putting a figure a good friends at the caput an energy density figure to different electrochemical compounds whether it be litanies lindonira
1577.43,1588.05, and if anybody were to want to run led at it which is the stable electrochemical technology that we use in static
1588.05,1599.51, notations for americans than more commonly the case that the betters that we used to start a case that's hundredweights
1599.51,1606.2, why would you carry over a hundred kilograms erect white by having a different technology but that
1606.23,1607.67, illustrates
1607.67,1633.74, confused i have confused it too much but demonstrates the methodology that we used to define what would be a sorer capacity but if we had a practical electrician limit it to that we limit it to moustachioed
1634.91,1640.73, one thing to add is the even with this relatively modest amount of stored energy
1640.76,1643.97, the performance of these cars is simply incredible
1645.23,1647.69, nominally five killed without
1647.69,1657.17, if a car only requires one point three kilos to go one hundred columns or you can go an awfully long way with absolutely no son
1657.98,1661.37, even a top speed the car only
1661.73,1666.38, maybe clambers in or the carolineans may be twelve kilos
1666.65,1669.95, so you can go for if your motor could handle it
1670.1,1672.89, a hundred fifty comes an hour
1673.16,1676.25, the relatively small amount of store energy these cars feature
1677.3,1680.06, one case
1680.27,1688.64, oatmeal as a number of eating but certainly running all night in the dark to find silician through the night
1689.57,1700.76, actually andres can you please take us into the car and sort of describe when you're sitting in the car you know the disease all of that sort of thing for us
1700.91,1707.48, sure one of the things that the current set of rules and sort of our current
1707.51,1710.81, thinking if you like is afforded
1710.9,1712.94, of the modern solar cares that
1712.97,1714.77, just like any other car
1714.8,1715.91, well
1715.94,1724.01, i have a few pages which one how fast the cars going what sort of energy or consuming how much energy to have one
1724.13,1727.16, and you're also presented with
1727.16,1735.2, and automotive type trod and automotive type break so it really unlike perhaps carson
1735.35,1736.25, asked
1736.28,1738.44, it's really a standard driving experience
1738.71,1742.76, a little warmer inside the normal and you can't turn on your condition you want
1742.82,1745.67, than that it drives like a normal care
1747.44,1780.65, i was of that one thing i've always wanted you i've seen the cars from the outside and so on but i've always wanted to sort of stick my head in and get get an idea of what it would be like to be a driver all right i think one of the last questions i'd like to ask you basis can you i'll give you a choice an option of questions and one can you ireton of your most memorable fabulous moments on one of the races or either describe a typical day for me
1780.65,1781.91, he

1908.9,1910.43, are
1911.63,1919.16, and sitting around and discussing and joking about the things they weren't right that day and perhaps the things that didn't go so
1920.93,1925.7, and then as the sun fades away and then you get the incredible stars
1925.76,1928.16, the very clear nights
