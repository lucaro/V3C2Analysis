21.81,22.92, illustrate
23.37,25.92, doing cartoons in text books on things like that
26.4,28.11, years ago i think
29.73,34.86, i am working in film i did a lot of craters families
35.43,43.95, and i got to a point where i decided that i didn't really much rather be making my own stuff and exhibiting it in a way that was sort of controllable really
44.16,51.72, i had been exhibiting prior to that i had a few hollows and it always been making work in the background like while i was working in filmy
53.82,59.04, whenever i had some time off all back to the studio and make a new sculpture of my own
59.55,61.92, went to what i really wanted to do which is
62.16,63.36, ping
63.54,70.5, and puppets and things like that i mean the process usually goes
70.62,73.77, this an initial drawing sub sketches
74.01,80.49, and then i'll go from door marie a small version at the fine sculpture and then no
80.49,88.08, that's all resolved and nice and plain and and works then all going to the folies
88.5,89.82, i
89.94,91.95, the drawing is so
92.88,103.89, will begin i think really i used to try making very quickly like in montana was a lie that they seem now to take about
104.4,107.19, part of three months really
107.28,119.01, sometimes a simple sculpture that same really simple to make one up being really difficult usually there reference from some one i know
119.37,126.06, are often it's like a combination of a few different people this alisaundre people whose
126.06,130.41, a friend of my mother she really was very kind and
130.62,134.49, mother took some photos of her and used her as reference you know beautiful face
134.88,139.86, the babies are generally from kids were now bereft of them when their babies
139.95,174.15, some of them are literally combination of the whole bunch of different people and just like a mad out face but i think there's a lot of there are a lot of issues with it it's very controlled process so you have to kind of strange it all the way through and often that's not very free processionaries a little bit more interesting i think that's why i always change the style a little bit and always been happy to kind of throw in some other elements like him animals or make a little bit more sure
174.36,223.83, some of the sculptures like people had an emotional likewise have so family member or something like that in the work and so i precepts a good example people would say it and say either appearance alive of his that would sort of effect their interpretation of the work which was nice to see actually because if i had my own angle one of the mimbreno sculpture because i feel like i've just got to a point where i've got the process a very robust and it's very plain and efficient is because it's so robust and the resistance and the norwich means that tom it's not kind of giving itself off over time as very stable
224.43,274.56, the look i tend to include them in pocketed the same like with this particular work having a baby in an older woman it's really the same individual and atsochwat camp balancing it in a way and so not like a literal sanitaetsrat so i think that's probably one of the things that may very challenging the case is now instruction many of
