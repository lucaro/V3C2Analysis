2.43,18.21, everybody read hoppner was another of my video critiques he'd like to submit images for one of these pleas do you can find instructions on that at the beginning of the post for this as well as at the end of this videotape
18.27,27.12, people submitted david douglas and norm let's get started with david's first picture david has it looks like a cloud inversion of grand canyon
27.45,166.56, there's always when i first entered a picture i say where the strength weaknesses and the strength here of course are going to be clouds and the canyons and the color back there got nice kind of leading line in the bottom of the ridge here littletail the tree in a touch coloradite problems i think are more to do with things coming in from the edges which is not uncommon these bear kind of straggling branches don't work as a framing if you want to framing device you'd like to have something dark and heavy out of focus of possible a kind of sweeps in a round at least from one of the sides so i want to get rid of those and then heselrigge will also pull the eye away so fishing's go ahead and take this into avintas potentials ungentleman into potshot and open that olinto what is going to be a oberregierungsrat have the same tools there so let's start with a crowner too and then i'll start dragging a crop you noticed that will red circle that is just an appius to make it easier for people viewing this to see where my curse is on the screen just as in framing pictures while shooting i'm going to work the edge and so i'm looking at what's going on like the sea a little bit of that tree poking in there so let's pull and to get rid of that and lashes out the bottom remember i want to stay away from that poking up a little bit of brightness coming in so going to crosses but so much of it let's come down a little bit and i'll hit my return my intreaties point probably want to work with one inconsistent somethingorother when your adjusting contrast you're going to like the light of areas as well as darkening the darkest areas if you really just want to darken the dark tones then it's probably better to go down and use that black slideth bit just to what i like to say as locked down those dark tones also the color i want to bring a little more of the color in the mountains he
167.07,263.13, so i can come down and i can push that vibrance up i turned to prefer vibrant over saturation because it's less drastic he'll give me a nice pot and i'll go up to maybe your round normally and go out and slide the clarity usually i'll go about that somewhere in that area and i can hit the review to see before and after what i've done with the active paneled i've done you know when i do the prevost undo the crop it just undoes what's going on in this panelled with a color here so i've got a temperature and tense lieutenant stottler that's because yellow is the opposite of blue monotone the exposure down a little bit and then let's see what we can do to fix that blue sky so i just went to work the blue sky that means i'm going to use a selective tool and i'll just grab the adjustment rush take that and come over and let's see what i want to do it make a little more blue so i slide that blue spider over nothing's happening because i haven't done anything with the brush yette exposure slider just to effect the color for now and then i come up here that little black circle you see right outside my red curser indicator is where mostly effect is going to take place and then it will fade off to the edge of that black and white rectangle i use the brackets only keyboard to make that brush larger smaller so i make a bit bigger and then i'm just going to start sweeping in and you can see how i'm getting more blue in the sky now remember i didn't do anything with
263.25,289.89, the exposure all i did was pushed a little more blue and so right now this is active me see my red pin so i could go further with it if i wanted my little blue i might push a little maintain to it just going through the look i want i can try pushing the exposure down i think that might be a little too hard little too drastic so maybe just push the black over attack and that will get a little more punch to it finally since the
290.37,300.21, focus of the picture is in the center here what about darkening the edges i could use a brush for that i could do another dustmen brush but also i have this thing called the radio filter
300.27,312.93, let the radio filter and i can draw a circle or an oval and i can change the shape of that i can spin a power i want in the way i have it sent right now let's look down here and i will so in
314.13,340.41, steffeck is taking place outside of that circle and i got the feather of fifty i'm going to go and push it up to a hundred because i want that very soft effect happening of course the effect is going to be whatever is in this panel here and right now it's just set for blue temperature slide into blue and a little bit of black so let's reset those so nothing's happening out on the edges and really all i wanted as a slight burn so may be just push the exposure down and again that's affecting only the edges
340.56,358.05, here's my review before and after what's going on there i'm done with this now let's go back to the original soil over a photonic and i'll make that i do screen we can see here is the original and the retention
358.11,359.43, the senders
359.43,386.94, so not a lot to that but again playing with the strength of the image and see what else we have here so i'm going to escape out of that go back to photonic and come the next picture the another of david's photos and i think what we got here we've got nice strong graphic elements of these curves and the dark tones would get some good yellow some rich blew up here there's other detail here but i am going to focus just on the graphic qualities in the center of the picture so let's go ahead and bring that into the telecamera
387.48,400.83, i'm going to first thing just like last time all grandly crop too and i'll draw a crop in there and the question is well where am i going to go with that and i'm going to start up where that blue and yellow
401.52,405.09, together when i make that the upper corner my picture
406.11,444.12, then i can play around down here and kind of decide how much more i think i'll keep that in nice sweet going over there at the return okay so if i want to do contrast not to punch that up a little bit now here's one of those times were punching up the contrast is bleeding out some of my coloring those lighter tones and making them even lighter so maybe not so much with contrasts but more with the blacks did that black slide before the onset darkened those dark tones keeps the viewers eye into the center here where we got the color and smother things going on and i might even want to hand the sonorous i do there well maybe play with that
444.18,445.5, tresler
445.62,453.27, the yellow over and i might even try some magenta again to work these colors and take the exposure down a bit more
454.17,461.85, i can touch the contrast up a bit and now i'm going for a much more grassy kind of look with that let's go look at the beginning 
463.92,467.43, here it is and here's where i ended up going with it
467.91,512.1, also look at what david did david sent me a second option on that where he turned his black and white and recovered a lot of the tones down here and i think that's nice too fat i like that but i did i might go a little more contrast on it a little more punch to it so many things black habitare think that's a real nice way to effect that also heedlessness this is actually memoranda where are the strength were the weaknesses these little things poked up again distractions so let's go in and watch that into a became raw and i'll go ahead and get that crop too first
512.43,517.47, i'm going to crop down there to try to minimize those which means i'm going to crop them out
517.98,526.92, i got the crop drawn i can shift it around a little bit by grabbing and pushing and pulling and i'm just going to take it down until i'm right at the edge here
527.16,552.51, i probably come to this corner and pulled down and when a boy a little bit to the role of third where i'm going to offset her my subject get it up into this quadrata i like that nicole touch a cloud there so i'll have the return a key and now i have cropped that i want now etshowe can do i think it needs more contrast we could try contrast we can you know push the black snow a little bit on it we can bring the exposure down you know give it a little bit of a moody or feel
553.29,577.77, color well if we start shifting to yellow or are things up it more gilmore orange look to it i have no problems with wore it is there i might play with the tenterground of an unreal look to the waters may be punch that up a little bit and take the exposure down so
578.07,584.52, i think that's about all we need to do that let's go back let's take a look at that original
584.94,588.72, so it was really a strong one let's go back here
588.84,621.33, so we started there it's just really a darkening and contrast adjustment plus a little bit of a crow and a clean up the bottom of the framing her originate out of that one what's goin to see the other one that dog gave us all right now i've got a sunset a little more going on i like having four brown elements of this is a little far away i love to see a palm tree may be somewhere more in this area but i don't know it was there when we could go back there that's work with this and obviously it's the sunset it's the water down here than dramatic clouds
621.63,623.55, bring it in our outward
623.58,626.82, well go ahead and get that crop too first thing
627.21,635.13, i'm going to crop out that palm tree much as i would like to have in the foreground just having a little bit of the branches poking in i think is more of a distraction
635.22,648.48, rotate that touch at times even though i might use a virtual rizon indicator a bubble livelihood to make sure i'm getting a good horizontal line
649.08,650.43, out there
650.58,674.58, oftentimes you'll find afterwards that it may not look quite right so i'm not afraid to go on and crop and rotate to get the field right now you see the red here that's because up here i have the highlight lerton on which is give me an indicator of overexposure i didn't have that turned on i wouldn't know that with blown some highlights sleeve that back on because that'll help guide me in what i do
674.61,682.38, i can either take the exposure liner or highlight since to highlander i usually try with the highlight slider first you'll see in this case
682.59,685.74, doesn't really knock that down entirely
685.83,688.41, the exposure slider will
688.53,697.11, he does nice job or recovering some detail and pulling those highlights down and i can't even come back at this point and bring that high light lineback up
697.65,706.62, until i have next nothing showing in their imitator so again here's my premium before and after what i've done just in this active panel
707.16,723.57, i'd like to bring out a little more colour in here so the vibrance and sat i mean the vibrant and clarity already punched up a little bit so i might work the sliders and we got a little bit yellow up there so my not push a tad more in and may be the agents well
723.81,729.33, the back and forth lanes about canework and let's bring our exposure down a little more
729.39,739.5, the picture is really all about the sunset and the tones and the colors in here now we got pretty dark in these areas so this is a time we might say let's go it the adjustment brush
739.71,746.97, i want to see these abstract fresh so command how and are on mac or control all pardon windows
747.48,755.43, as i went to lightness i'm going to dial a plus exposure and bit a plus exposure and probably some plus shadow recovery
755.55,782.4, my panel here and then come in and start sweeping around and you'll see i'm just getting a little bit of lightning in the dark areas i don't need it everywhere i just wanted in the center of these dark areas here and up into the clouds branthonne active pen so i can always adjust it further at that point it's pretty easy to see can go crazy with this and it's not going to look for a real this case i just want to get a little more punch out of it
782.49,791.19, pretty good so i can hit the return on that and come back to my basic panel and maybe push my black slider down a little bit
791.19,792.9, see where we started
795.36,796.5, there
797.46,798.87, and here's where i finished 
799.08,802.71, that was nice slow touch done there
802.98,808.2, escape out of this and come back to phoenician go to our next picture
808.32,810.63, secure in this case
810.63,832.35, no said below rose if you're going to submit him ages please try to give me the full resolution that give me more n more information more data to work with this is a pretty low repicture but let's see we can do here soon back out on screen there actually if i assume to see all the pies it ends a being all smaller because only a thousand piculs wide can't even fill the window on my trench laptop here
832.95,875.16, norm's got a nice pet action he's got good like good exposure unfortunately the writer is facing away from us and i know we've got people we can show faces that's always going to be better the actions going away from us and we also ended up in a possession where we've got this green tree protruding in there so in this case you know it all possible i want to change my position so i'm shooting into the face of the rider so we can see a little more what's going on from in front of them and see if i could find a position he cleaned up the background about the only thing i do editing this is i probably do a radiator in the centre just a dark and these edges a little bit to keep the attention in here where we want it on the next one got a man looking out the window let's go ahead and open this one up
876.39,885.57, more into bambarra and i just again like to give a little more punch so protect that black slider down some and really
885.84,892.62, you've got a person in the picture the eyes going to the person the rest becomes framing and so let's take everything else dark
892.8,900.06, i'll just get an adjustment brush remember that command option or control old or recess that
900.06,908.4, pushed just minus exposure and here let us the bracket key to make the brush vigor in a less just swing around here and just
908.4,912.27, darkening into pretty much everything except his face
913.47,921.66, person in the picture you know look to the person anyway so let's make sure that's where our eye is going i'm going to do a new brush
922.95,931.29, and let's back that exposure of take the highlights down because i want to knock down some of that brightness in the hair there so i'm going to go to a smaller brush
931.32,945.24, i really want to go into the top of head the hair and we can see that's looking too much right but since it's active i can always come back up here and say let's just back it out a little bit so it's looking realistic and i'm going to go up here and say new brush one more time
945.96,954.39, poor control or open the exposure of a little bit maybe a quarter or a third of a stop and i'm just going to go in and sweep on his face
954.93,960.06, at that out little bit and let's look where we started
960.54,981.6, here's our full image well we started in here's where we ended up not a big change but again playing with the strength of an a dark enon the edges and a light the face little bits o the attention goes more naturally the face and that's it for this week i hope more you guys submit pictures i will do another patient next couple of weeks after i get some more images thanks everybody
