1.08,12.78, back in the day most people made their own alcoholic beverage and every farm no matter what they grew they would grow apples so they could make cider
12.93,26.61, by sir they wouldn't even sell sighed that just makes it offer own consumption and it's going a very long astray and you're up in a pretty long history in the us too we're going to bring that back heresie
26.61,43.23, well we are a trap ademar we take apples from local farmers and repress them into a blue that we then ferment and really the old world european style than we ate them in wood
43.38,65.52, and he released it the history of cider in the us really started with the pioneers as people moved west of the east coast everybody brought the same three things everybody had a hatchet everybody had a rifle and everybody had an apple tree they made cider because number one they wanted something to enjoy at the end of a hard day's work
65.52,113.97, also they need something safe to drink in the tenth century is commercial growing got bigger sidman became less important at the home because you can do by your beer by your whisker wine then bill michigan has got a long history of being part of what they used to call the fruit belt because they grew so much fruit here and a lot of that fruit was grown to the chicago market the southwest of michigan because its right off the coast of lake michigan it really has a climate very similar to southwest england it's right on the coast to get a lot of rain and the apple tree will love it people want know where their food comes from right now they are sidearms with local fruit in at least twenty states
114.0,115.53, that's pretty cool
115.62,147.36, where big fans of carlo petrine and slow food and his design of a food system that's good clean and fair we like focusing on a product that's very clean to make the apple is so easy to grow and is so draughtless you don't need to water it you don't need to plant your after year it cleans the air it holds the soil tide its great harbor for beneficial insects fair has to do with the farmer
147.45,207.39, we want to support local farmers we're going to grow some apples here where we're always going to buy most of our apples from local family farmers guys who have been in this for three four five generations growing fruit and forty years ago there were four thousand farms growing apples in the state of michigan now we're down to a bottle eleven hundred we want to keep it over a thousand and to do that they have to have a crop that they can sell and make money and take care of their family we want to come in and buy apples not a market price but above love market price we also want them to grow apples outside the range of interest to an appropriation
207.54,217.71, where from a decent of the crop were in this for the long call anyone who is going to be planning trees is not in it for the short term
217.74,221.34, i think the farmers that we're dealing with understand that
221.7,236.82, well when we built this cider house we wanted to make us as clean a building as we could all the wood that we used throughout as a certified wood we don't eat the building leave basically let the natural
236.82,265.08, evolution of the seasons keep the sated in the winter by the time we get to spring and summer its offences and were selling it that's the way they've always made siders that's the way we're going to continue to do it here when we get apples they come in an apple crates that farmers use for ten to twenty years the stems and the skins those go to animal feeds and nothing's wasted in the process were not really creating garbage here
265.14,300.3, creating cider reconsider your looking for all different aspects of the fruit what it looks like those matter at all what you're looking for us how it smells how it tastes and then beyond that you're looking for the surcoat of the apple you're looking at the city of the apple we like high acid varieties and then were also looking for a lot of tan in from the apple that's what's going to give it some structure and somebody and give it a nice finish there's no one apple that has all those components
300.42,357.42, we look for all those components from a blend of apples when apples come from our local farms get dropped off on her dock take those apples on them sort of crossing over and up an elevator that drops down into the mill greenhouse partake the poise and we pumped it across and into the press that point we press those apples and the juice drops out we pump that juice over into the tanks once the juices in the tankette and will pitch etaient eastern things it makes for two and the sides that were producing unique sometimes affirmation is going to be completed in stainless but we actually have some stuff for working on right now that we put directly into barrels after pressing and we're going to let those spontaneously from meant
357.99,407.73, in five years what i'd love to see from virtue cider is a new standard we want to bring cider to the table to the tavern like craft brewers have with craft beer we want to see apple growers putting in more trees because they know they're going to make money off their fruit and we want people making choices when they choose who to support with their dollars in support the local farmers support the local brewer support the local side or make women we want to help the community here in finding a successful business irinel to the region we can turn south west michigan we can turn the fruit belt into the napoleon the sad
