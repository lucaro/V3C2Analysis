1.29,14.85, i sooner i'm gee onrest of attack france
15.15,150.24, i've been a member since the very beginning of our ties extremely pleased by the concept otherwise i am the board president of the transnational institute which is a world wide fellowship of scholar activists of people who are researchers and writers but they are also active in the social movements of their respective countries and i am a writer that my main occupation the causes started a long time ago the whole earlier doctrine which says you have to private everything i now have to trust to the private sector and you can borrow because the market will always go up and that you must reduce the capacity of the state to intervene all of these things at the market will self regulate because the market is all knowing and all seeing and it will it will be in a state of equilibrium no matter what happened all of this being complete rubbish of creation was accepted as a huguenot factories of concentric spheres i see finance on the outside as being the driving force its driving the real economy and it is telling that real economy which direction it has to go than those two together are telling society what it must and at last and least important to day is the environment which is simply treated by the economy and by finance as a place where we get our natural resources and where we can throw away our waists what is the more recent cause of the financial crisis in one word its debt
150.33,188.31, in one word it is the fact that both private and public entities have built up a great deal of debt it is the fact that the banks in the united states took different kinds of debt they put them together in a big financial colding financial moment and they tied them together and there were in that mountain that calanthe were student loans and automobile loans and credit card one and above all there were housing to mortgages and the
188.61,217.74, as a back up for securities that were created by these banks they put all these debts together they mix them on in this big caldron they take out the mixture they chop it up and in slices of sausage like that and they sell them on to other customers saying you will be paid back you will get a return of ex percent it was depth and using death as the
218.01,282.63, back up for all these toxic securities these toxic slices of sausage based only on debt called collaborated death obligations that the fancy name for them because the collateral was supposed to be all of these debts package together and beyond a certain point you can't base an economy on debt there always has to be a relationship with the real economy with how much people are actually making with what is the distribution of that money and if you spent thirty years putting all the money right up in the stratosphere where the richest people live at you don't leave much for the rest of the society and you have a lot of people who are extremely borderline and who cannot keep up their payments under any circumstances that's why they're called sub prime mortgages the prime organs for the middle or upper class who can afford to make a payment every month a sub prime is under
282.66,313.53, time and they were simply unable to pay even throughout the sixties there were regulatory agencies or there were semi public companies like the mortgage companies fannie may and freddie mac which probably seen their names in the papers and there were public and her prizes that were supposed to keep all of this ticking over and not become not got out of hand but the bank spent
313.68,324.78, a lot of money the best calculation i've seen as they spent about five billion dollars over the years getting rid of this legislation
324.99,329.82, they got rid of twelve major 
330.12,353.67, ariosto their full expansion of course the politicians like bush put people in the regulatory agencies that didn't think regulation was a good thing so they sat on their hands they didn't do anything maybe the worst in terms of the world situation is that they got rid of a
353.94,403.89, a law which regulated the commodities markets in particular the wheat corn so all those crop markets when the big speculators the hedge funds the banks all of the people with a lot of spare cash to figure out that the subprior is going to crash they get out of that market and they go into commodities and they buy huge numbers of wheat or soar corn contracts they don't have any intention of ever taking delivery on all that wet but they think that they can make a fast dollar out of it i'm so for example one day into thousand eight the price of wheat went up by thirty one per cent
404.19,417.06, in one day now this is not a question of supply and demand this has nothing to do with the underlying commodity and this was a tragedy because that meant that there were
417.21,427.41, hundreds of thousands millions of people in the world who were having to pay suddenly twice or three times as much for their staple food
427.77,439.98, because the united states dominates the market and it fixes the world price basically so this was a tragedy but it was also because the so called commodities
440.04,445.17, markets modernization and i were they wanted
445.17,564.63, the regulate they call it modernization or reform is just de regulated the whole industry the case of iceland was one in which a private bank to two major private banks were selling a lot of security saying that they were going to give high percentages and they marketed these things particularly in britain and in holland and some gullible people just put a whole lot of savings into them and it was a kind of pyramid scheme they would pay back their first customers with what they got coming in regularly and they ate but once again and the man were to remember is dead they created deaths for themselves at which they said they would remember them a fantastic interest rates so the nave investor put money into that and then of course there's a point when those bags collapse in the icelandic people were very wise to reject paying back to the british or the doctor any one else the fact that the band had in a totally irresponsible manner onaccountable financial mechanism but it came down to the following let's say that i can insurance on my neighbors hunterdon that house and then i get the money from the insurance company will at illustrating the work
564.66,576.06, a totally honorable citizens but it's clear that they were betting against the greek dead and they were in the position to take out insurance
576.09,577.65, the greek debt
577.89,582.72, would go down and they was like a self realizing
582.72,586.65, they went in the great debt
586.65,602.37, exploded they made they made a lot of money they burnt down the house and they collected the money it's hurting people's lives its reducing
602.37,607.98, quality and the quantity of public services the government cannot
608.1,628.53, continue to pay for the banks but also provide for welfare state so of course it's the people who are paying it's always the people who pay is always the weakest link it's not them minority with power is always
628.65,632.22, the weakest part of the
632.22,647.67, the society unfortunately until citizens get organized and get mad and get mad together and put pressure on their governments they will do as little as possible and let's not forget
647.94,687.54, that our government are also very close to the banks certainly the german government and the french government are much more interested in what happens to the banks and they are in what happens to ordinary citizens unfortunately but that's the reality of politics to day we don't have to solve the banking crisis in this way what i propose is that any bank which has received public money is socialized totally or partially
687.54,690.57, and that there is a
690.99,726.6, mandate that they must henceforward devote present of their portfolios to loans to small and medium businesses and to people who have an ecological project because we know from several reports that it is the green economy that will provide the solution to the unemployment crisis and i think unless we can get the banks under control but we're a long way from that that we will continue to let them run a muck they will
726.66,738.87, they will make their own laws which is what they have been doing for the last ten years you know what they are already selling the banks they are buying up insurance policies
738.96,756.81, of terminally ill people or people who are old and really sick and statistically what they're counting on is that these people will die quite early and they will make enormous profits and they are now selling these things the way they sold
757.14,764.76, collateralis dead obligations on supprime or whatever other kind of debt and
765.03,819.57, they will continue to invent these exotic products and they will continue to find ways to com modify everything i think commodity in sickness and death is going pretty far unless you get that sort of thing under control unless you say that credit default swaps are illegal unless you say you can't buy the equivalent of a insurance policy on your neighbor's house bruno the house and collect the money unless you can do all of that they will continue to invent ways of enriching themselves if you open the door and you let the children into the candy store and say you know stay here and eat as much as you want that's what they'll do already last you golden sack which is now the bank everybody loves to hate but last year there were a hundred and thirty one
819.57,825.72, working days where they made over a hundred million dollars during the day
826.74,841.98, i mean you can either say okay goldman you can go on doing that or you can say enormous number of these products have no social value whatsoever on the contrary
842.61,862.44, and you can get them under control but i see very few signs that the g twenty is taking any of this very seriously they will regulate around the edges because people are angry but they're not going to do anything basics will come to another crisis sooner or later
