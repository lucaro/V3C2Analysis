30.54,35.1, in the coming days in the workshops and in the panels
35.16,42.18, my name is small socks i am one of the board members of the foundation democracy media
42.18,51.54, and i would like to tell you very short what our foundation is about and why and how we organized this conference
51.9,55.5, first of all about the our foundation
55.8,59.49, i need to go back in history
59.55,63.45, the beginning of our foundation goes back to world war i
63.51,74.67, in which in the first printed illegal newspaper appeared had balthe watchword had put all free and fearless
75.0,105.21, in the following years this illegal newspaper reached editions of a hundred thousand copies and that this was not an easy thing to do because journalists printers and the people who did the illegal deliveries lived under a constant threat of arrest by the germans many people who worked for hadding the war have been incarcerated and many paid with their lives for the resistance work that they did
105.75,112.41, after the liberation in nineteen forty five and we all continued as a legal newspaper
112.47,123.0, and the ownership was placed in a non profit foundation to prevent commercial interest to influence the content of the newspaper
123.6,131.76, and it is this foundation that after some changes in the course of the years which is now the foundation democracy in media
132.48,136.2, i'm telling you this old history
136.2,181.02, emphasize that the foundation democracy and media has its roots in the resistance and in the struggle for freedom and independence which are values which we also stimulate and stand for in the present i'm very proud to welcome them from norman and his wife who is sitting here in france only because all the other places are still empty and who is one of the founders of the poland who was also his director in the sixteenth is now the honorary chair of our foundation very welcome them
181.05,183.3, what does the foundation do
183.48,187.92, we support and we invest and we develop as
188.01,197.91, our name activities about media and democracy we stimulate quality media all the new and quality journalism
197.94,213.81, and on the democracy side we support at the paper we supported initiatives for an innovative and vibrant democracy we do that with grand with investments and our own activities like this conference
214.2,218.22, now why did we organize this conference
219.09,244.44, also in the netherlands as in other countries in europe we are confronted with the conservative backlash with nationalist and fundamentalist elements and also in the netherlands the alienation and mistrust of people is spelt with the established democratic institutions because people don't feel represented by the existing political structures
244.77,252.75, but unlike in other countries little public debates or public revolt has been happening here
253.23,261.21, the occupy movement had only and other recent uprisings have only had a very weak echo in this country
261.84,284.46, the protest movements and evolutions of young people the millennium generation that you a new generation of activists who think global who develop collective leadership who used the new media who make concretions and who have no trust in the existing pleasing political structures that has not really taken off here in the netherlands
284.61,293.28, and in the dutch media there is very little attention for what is happening in this respect and the rest of the world
293.73,312.36, reactions to the global economic crisis actually are only reported on when there is a violent outburst or when there are ten thousand people somewhere gathered in one square and what's happening in neighborhoods what's happening in the movement what's happening in factories gets very little attention
312.48,326.76, that is why we from democracy immediate sort we wanted to do something to stimulate also in the netherlands the public debate and learn about what is happening in other parts of the world
327.06,342.87, so i contracted my animal who you will see in a little while and many of you have been mailing with who is an expert at the university of light and lobelia and social movements and i asked her what can we as a foundation do
343.26,356.85, and after some months she came back with the idea of this conference to enable activists and scholars and journalists to meet and to exchange ideas and to use
356.85,359.82, some time together to really
359.85,376.92, stimulate each other's ideas and thoughts were one together with bandanna the film maker half worked tireless to contact the people they know to ask their ideas and to make a program for this conference
376.95,389.97, and the boy has done a lot of the logistics and very flexible and varied the last moment so we very grateful for that and now it is up to you my friends to make it happen
