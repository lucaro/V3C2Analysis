0.12,14.82, he evaporation a company called out liar and what we do is make tailor performance clothes 
14.82,28.29, think about it as i went century version of men's way or we take high tech fabrics and make clothes that you can wear any day anywhere whether it's climbing a mountain or disking to work in the morning
28.62,29.97, but
30.21,36.18, years ago i had no idea how to make clothes it was a graft dishonour spent all day staring at a computer screen
36.33,38.49, and that was it
38.61,45.72, because i was spending so much time sitting down staring on a computer i got really into sapling i'm a native new yorker i grew up
45.72,46.95, the city
46.98,50.79, and just walk up one day and realize that
50.97,67.41, felt better to ride my bike into or over the bridge like a walk into the office and feel great and feel fresh and i feel free and i really got into cycling not it really the cultural thing to ismene of transportation i really felt like a better way to move around the city
67.65,109.47, but i started having issues really simple issues with with my clothes really was destroying my genes like nonstop every six weeks every two months and by another paradise tearing them up and then there's the huge weather issues when you're cycling like what do you do when it snows what do you do in a rain what do you do when it's fifty per cent chance of rain in it looks gorgeous out but as a fifty presentation to show up and being drenched and you know the uncomfortable all day just because it might rain what do you do when you important meeting you want to wear your best pants and you're worried that arbaces going to tear up and then you just suffer on the subway like a sardine
109.5,139.98, so like any good american i des went out i went shopping said i i'm going to buy myself a pair of pants that i can wear every day and write my bike to work and they should be water resists anticamera and i should say will go by him somewhere and so went shopping and i guess i'm not really good shopper because i started looking for these past and i caplin for him and after about a year i gave up and said i think the things actually don't exist on the market place and
140.16,144.84, nobody is going to make them and i guess i'm just going to have to figure out how to do it myself
145.26,168.72, so i went here this is the button thirteenth fashioned center information ciascuno that if i didn't read it off the screen but an it's not far it's a couple of miles from here on thirty nine street and seventh avenue and i literally just walked up this kiosks hay i want to make a pair of pants oh
168.99,208.02, and now wealthy said ah sure no problem here and they had literally printed me out of big list to different companies in the garment district which still here in new york is still thriving as a couple of blocks from times square and you know i started going down the lasting call in copies and some were out of business and some of them had no interest at all and talking to me but a surprising not acted quite open and some of them said i we can't help you but go across the street the other hope or in some one we can do it so i found myself in a factory in the garment district thirty eighth street and they said yea and i probably can make your parapara
208.53,220.56, i also found during all my shopping actually did by one thing what a part short from small company and it was made with an incredible fabric made in switzerland by a company called cottle's this is their mill
220.59,227.58, making a fabric very similar to the stuff we use is probably the most advanced textile mill in the world
227.94,238.38, i have found the shorts and i called up the company at her you can make a pair of pants like these susangata i can't where i'm to work and he said no sir
238.41,249.63, i had the fabric and i was like i think i can make pants with these and i contacted the company a contented shoulder and i convinced them to sell me a small amount of fabric
249.69,252.51, i took him into the factory and i sewed together
252.57,259.53, papa this is our original garment again had to anitoo him and i put them on 
259.68,263.88, my wife and i kept a bright on my bike and i you know
264.18,275.76, are those pants for a year almost every day and i started thinking it really custer pair of hands i like
275.82,289.56, great luckily there is incredibly durable fabric they weren't actually falling apart but i released you know a second part third paris other colors some variation other style and i realized that
289.71,292.74, is going to make more pants i really was going to have to
293.19,304.71, about starting a company is dealing with real businesses and i was able to make one pan and if you could also go to the gardiston make one pan but dealing with factories that are trying to make a lot of pants to dealing with
304.74,322.71, they're trying to sell a lot of fabric is going to have to start a company so i started doing the research figuring out i knew nothing about how to resist wrongs but figured i can make a perpetrators most that cost is actually in the fabric film but making things in new york is not cheap either and you know traditional
323.13,333.96, business sort of a outdoor industry still work the vihodar you saw it for two i would take it so fruity dollars wisiting it to a store is going to go take it and sell it for tornados
333.96,357.3, propounded business ah no but by portola solito it's not as keystone there still parts of the clothing industry that work like this but i live in new york and it's the luxury world run is expensive and there is also a lot more people involved so that same sinnify dollar pants i start working
357.6,399.27, the showroom they're going to sell it for about tiresome thing dollars they're going to sell to a store that might triple the price they're sort of extreme but you end up with light almost a six hundred fifty or her aunts and i'd never bought as for six hundred fifty dollars before never really brought pants for three hundred dollars before in this it came with a sport coat on top but by what i had thought was like i said like it if i can figure how to make this around a hundred eighty dollars to a sort of like the one i was looking at this a bought nice pants for hundred eighty dollars at swarthiness market was as like of i can figure out how to do it if i can cut out all these other costs and and make a perfessor hundred eight hours i think i could actually
399.54,407.4, start a business like this and so it's been a lot of times during a screen so it's like i'm just going to take it i'm going to put it on line and i'm going to
407.4,411.09, try and sell directly to people on line
411.18,419.76, that was my first hypothesis was just like okay if i can figure out how to take these pants and just make em myself and cut out all the middle men
420.48,426.18, a website and soon the people you know there might be other people who have the same kind of issues that have and
426.9,428.97, and eleseus
429.39,450.93, that's really all i had as you know like a kimono try a start this i knew how to make a log and know how to you know start a website but and now how to talk to people and quite know how to start a business and one day i walked in my local coffee shop cottonwool in giving coffee and the brisoners of allier she said hey
450.99,453.24, you really got to meet this guy tiler
453.6,457.62, doing exactly what you're doing except a short
457.68,468.12, and pilaster so if you see him say i am
468.96,474.93, allerseelen few blocks away from me and he worked he had not for a year at a shorting company
475.23,477.0, a latin and
477.09,513.12, over the bridge and its fifty minute like ride and every day he would have to come in to work and change his clothes and he thought this is crazy with why do have to ride my wife for fifteen minutes and needed new sharp like and so he was actually working with the very same fabric noisettes trying to develop a better form of sardines a little bit farther behind linburne same idea where both just talking the same orofenan took a little bit of time to get used to each other but he telleth three months we had formed a company
513.12,514.68, i was born
514.8,516.69, when 
516.84,523.44, it was to a restful time jobs but we incorporated and were like all right let's figure out how to make this happen
523.44,556.77, and we set about trying to actually produce pants in volume building a website and trying to get it together and then one day in september september two thousand eight my friend roy whose loss be here somewhere called me up and said he you might be anyone tracts just hanging out with my friend tanawan he works it in case now and there making bags with the same fabric hooking a shaitan soothed telling about your company i should mereside and i think he's going to put it up
557.1,571.05, his blow and this is the actual post spelling not perfect in its one sentence but all the sudden we went from having a webster didn't really exist and to one that actually had an audience and
571.44,583.89, quickly all the sudden like other sites at epicier little cycle pieces may have heard of actually picked it up on some high and sort of men's wear street were
583.89,588.21, or designated it up an almost sudden people
588.27,589.71, our pasts and
589.77,602.01, have em we had really nothing i don't think you can read what's on the screen when we literally weeliam god now what do we do and so we just put a line on the site the mail us and we'll get in touch
602.01,612.63, on the list and we do we're going to have pantaloon that turned out as things go that it took a couple of months but finally he put it together we 
612.84,636.36, the pass on our website wearing a pale buttons we put a papal button and a couple of pans up in the website and we sent out an email and we started selling bats and so that was the first hypothesis that like a free just put them in line and still in forehanded eight dollars like people would buy them and it turned out to be true of the mass changed little bit we were selling for a hundred eighty eight some of the
636.45,642.63, changed in the process but it worked we had a start of a company in
642.84,647.16, i said okay how would we want to do and
647.76,654.6, thinking about this what had just happened like what went on and we could pay 
654.69,669.12, put a really product that we spent out of time and thought into designing a well designed product and put on a web site and it sort of soldier there is no sails people on a web page right it's just text and graphic and
669.18,675.93, there's exceptions there's video sales and what not but for the most part it's a web page with the description of a product and
676.02,677.46, they may be
677.58,681.57, well desprut really sell itself on line and we set about just
681.81,704.01, and saying what's the next product want to make we knew we didn't want to be just a white company that was one of the things we wanted to know were making clothes for cycling but it wasn't because cycling was our life style antenor than to cycling company we wanted to make really well designed products and put on lines we started making stuff made the shirt 
704.34,714.66, a lot of to develop a sweat resisting cot and then we also spent a lot of time working on the actual cut of the shirt changing hawthorns moved to liberate the movement open up
715.08,717.42, the way you move when you're wearing a shirt
717.54,722.94, from the front looks like a really classic ministry are for you wear it sweat
722.97,741.72, they won't see you sweat awe work a lot with marina wall one of nature's most amazing technologies grows on the backs of sheep down in new zealand and its actual really incredible libraries nothing like the wall that you're used to doesn't it doesn't scratch and feels
741.87,750.9, incredible and is actually a performance fabric of pools seaway from your body keeps you cool in the summer cityward in the winter so we built a lot
751.35,752.49, that
753.84,755.07, then
755.52,759.78, a short three way short 
760.65,769.5, one of our first big blow hits of balled like knob took him to the beach toward snap rolled off but he really designed to seek and
769.5,771.15, go to the beach
771.36,778.53, also leoncito climb out of the water and to be dry and comfortable immediately better short sodoma women's clothes
778.65,789.18, really difficult as a lot easier when we're just making close for ourselves oh but these pants are great and we really hope to have more
791.28,799.5, cleary bring a little nature at into the technology were using really high tech fabrics and wanted to see if we could place nature akin
799.65,802.32, we made a water proof she
802.35,807.57, getting tired of getting cut out in the rain and walking around and water loses
809.28,821.55, we tackled the gene as well is there someone said okay can we make a more durable gene can we make a more comfortable jeanne that's not going to wear out or walk around and also handler in the weather
822.99,833.43, mentioned this one out of the archives it's all war war british technology it's sort of like percent cotton or texts really amazing
833.79,837.69, and the back back as one of the last things he did 
837.75,842.07, super lightly back to confidence pocket
842.43,863.52, time stronger than steel floats on water forestalled by names pretty amazing all that's evil water safe so that was a second i bought sister no we had a company is now ten of us growing allied as is the website and there is no salespeople yet so we descried things in the online
863.7,879.15, she might be saying that andfind of easy and so i want to want distress if not easy at all for he sacredly hard a awful lot of work but but at the same time like the
879.15,886.89, i think that it is sort of easy in a way because the market had left an opening for us
886.95,915.9, where there are too many companies that are just focusing on making cheap crap and shipping it across oceans and selling it and there was a big opening the people weren't making quality goods and people responded to what we were doing because we said we're going to put quality first and we're going to make productiveness item that like who knows where it came from and who knows what lampooned up in
915.99,919.05, so that's sort of the third hypothesis
919.11,923.97, impure on that back from what i did and
924.45,926.22, talk about the way
926.82,932.25, what we learn that the internet is actually changing the way that protects can be designed and how they can be sold
933.36,935.22, this is just sort of 
936.36,942.39, abstraction of a design process and the chain in a lot of ways
942.51,945.45, designs are working organization the working with
945.66,961.77, teams and marketing teams in those sales teams are selling to another organization that has its own planners it's on sales people since another organization that might actually be talking to the end use and you know we live in a negociation directly
961.8,975.0, to customers and build products and you can do it cheaper and you can sell things all over the world as well i think that's one of the most important things our first customer was actually in australia we
975.9,980.52, we sent out the first mail sent out of midnight we figured okay
980.79,985.56, wake up in the morning hopefully we'll have a soul a product at and but
985.65,997.32, within a minute or two somebody was up in australia it was morning and boom foresail and right now he felt thirty per cent of our sales in her natural you can put something on the internet sell anywhere
997.5,999.51, you can sell it cheaper
999.81,1004.1, you don't even need calls people to it didn't sell by 
1004.22,1009.89, anybody can do it i know nothing about making clothes five years ago and
1010.82,1013.04, that same thing to work with any industry
1014.81,1017.24, all illustration from a
1017.48,1033.74, and you know there's three courts were started and we three concepts to start of brand you can do it in
