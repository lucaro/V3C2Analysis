457.68,465.33, in this became aware of the emotional tone the feeling tone of her body
501.06,512.49, emotions are intelligent expression of energy that can lead us to our awakened nature as a quote by reggie ray

606.39,610.23, go into that direct experience of the emotion
610.29,622.17, can be immediately present with whatever emotion is experienced in her direct way he can experience each emotion and a fresh and new way
622.44,648.48, karanama your body into an ax now so take care arms and legs to the corner of vermont the relax our body completely relaxed shoulders or luxulyan then again to lengthen her left leg off the ground and they get across said over your body

765.18,773.76, here the round up the back britain arch herbeck
774.33,777.57, so what is emotional awareness
778.83,783.27, emotional awareness and you know this is just something that
783.54,791.85, i've called it but being emotionally aware means being completely open and present with
791.91,803.22, ever emotion is a rising within you with emotional awareness we are free in the experience of whatever emotion arises
803.4,810.33, we are with the straight undiluted essence
810.42,813.36, experience of the emotion
813.42,822.99, he walked to the side will do oppose to the side to get a little sieninski in his well
834.3,838.95, then the other side
844.83,847.56, he
849.06,864.87, and then come back center and open your knees wide set back on a heels commented child's pose of the others one you can lie on your back and hunger as into your chest instead
866.25,883.65, so what normally happens instead of opening up to the straight up undiluted essence experience of the emotion when normally happens is that we experience an emotion and then there's some level of shutting down are turning away from the emotion
883.71,896.31, we retract from the pure undiluted experience of the emotion and pull back from it we do this by trying to figure it out
896.88,915.18, try to figure out why we're feeling the emotion where the emotion came from how to resolve that in short we start to try to attach a story a story line to the emotion
917.01,922.08, in a walk ahead back in your going to come up
922.17,931.71, lunch post let's start by walking her left leg through you could actually use her block here if you want
947.64,948.93, he
961.5,967.56, think down through your front left foot come upright reach your right arm up
971.4,976.71, and then you can release this side and we'll go ahead into the other side
977.55,981.24, these again to step your right leg through
989.55,993.03, think down their front
993.03,995.01, but
995.73,1003.62, i come a prey and lifter left arm
1027.86,1046.46, and then i can release that down in raging to step back into deifying dog you can do dowsing dog against the wall or using a table of its two weight bearing for your for your upper body
1046.46,1053.33, the one spare fingers wide tuckets under
1066.65,1079.49, the figure looked at the space between your hands and then you're going to walk your feet into your hands
1081.23,1086.18, the maker way up to standing
1087.47,1098.09, a carom standing were going to take a big step back with our left foot
1098.66,1102.74, he peer hissing the front
1102.95,1106.22, a man in your arms
1106.7,1107.84, straight out
1110.0,1113.09, so about a week ago
1114.86,1117.5, overcome with
1117.5,1119.12, sadness
1119.15,1121.01, i was just
1121.19,1128.9, completely consuming the experience of sadness was all consuming i could
1129.11,1133.52, feel it in every ounce of my being
1135.08,1137.12, i do
1137.18,1139.25, i pulled away from it
1139.55,1143.42, and i started to try to figure it out
1143.72,1168.08, why am i feeling said where did this feeling is sadness come from and i started to go back through my whole day and all my interactions and i tried to figure out who like a blame my sadness on like i caught it like some kind of flew muggering
1173.36,1176.6, he let this pasture body on the side
1179.51,1183.38, and then you'll take a step back with her right
1186.5,1193.25, think down through your front left it bone and lift your arms up for a warrior one on the other side
1195.86,1219.17, there's no end to trying to figure out the reason why you're having the emotion for me to try to figure out the sadness you can go back through your whole life and go back for your childhood you can go back through all your past lives as well it's an endless endless endless journey to trying to figure it out
1219.23,1226.58, can my kindled just turned off so element that
1226.58,1232.82, this is how futile it is actually the fete the utility of figuring it out
1233.3,1240.11, no end to pulling away from the intensity of the direct experience of the emotion
1242.96,1250.64, sadness like any other emotion is simply part of being human
1253.97,1256.85, he let the pasture out of your body
1259.82,1317.18, so emotions are just a play of energy and yet we retract from them we need to resolve them we need to explain them and in the case of the day that where was experiencing that intensity of sadness with it i do i walk straight into the grocery store i walked down to the chip aisle i got a big a big chips and i went i didn't even get it i didn't even make it to pass the car i got to the car some days i don't even make it at the grocery store and i ate the entire baggage not all one sitting but the rest through the rest of the day the breast the whole bag of the chips and then you know not only did i feel sad but i also had a stomach exothermic strokin of blend with the emotion of sadness right to be you know it's one way to dull the intensity
1317.66,1328.97, anyway let's let's come back up to the tavern maisie you're going to take a step back with your left leg again and you're going to turn to hips to the long edge of your map
1328.97,1334.13, then down to your friend writes it bombers up and your warrior to
1334.22,1347.81, so motions are not good or bad or indifferent we label our emotions we think joy oh well that's a good emotion or we think
1349.34,1381.89, calmness and peace oh well i'm a yogi those are definitely very good emotions for you have i should be calm and peaceful all the time i should bring more that into my life in the yogi i should be calm and peaceful yes those are definitely good emotions then we think anger fear anxiety no those are definitely bad emotions i shouldn't be having those emotions not me no those are definitely not emotions that i should be having so that we push those emotions away
1390.08,1413.33, the strain both your legs turn both your toes to the long edge of your man turn your left toe out your right toe in sink down to your left said bob but the thing is that we are delusional in our confused thinking and constructed stories explanations judgments around emotions
1413.45,1423.08, were distracting ourselves actually from the real experience labeling the experience judging and compartment alizon them
1423.68,1431.51, we simply using our intellect to distract ourselves from our direct experience
1431.9,1436.07, each emotional experience is fresh and new
1436.49,1449.45, with emotional awareness were letting go of our addiction to the thought process about emotions and were letting go of trying to figure it all at
1452.06,1454.7, as a straight near the s again
1454.85,1468.02, and let's turn your right toe out again and your left hosein sink down to your right it bone bring your arms up parallel to ground drop your left arm behind in your right arm buck
1469.85,1472.82, just let go into peaceful warrior here
1495.14,1505.91, i made that on the other side turned our left toes out sink down to your left sit bone
1506.3,1509.63, tartarin left him
1531.38,1540.02, and turbot your toast of a long edge of your map rule your public over your hypenor
1541.22,1578.36, when we're talking about motion awareness we are talking about being present the energy of the emotional experience itself emotions are boundless expressions of energies and so we exit from the emotion the sensation that direct experience we attach a story to it we wrap it up and reason and logic to re establish our sense of self and then what happens is the story line makes the emotional experience small enough again so that we feel like were in control
1579.08,1580.43, he
1605.96,1615.14, and then i hear her going to come down and are going to come on to our niece
1615.95,1627.41, and we're going to come down on her knees and you're going to need your blocks and you're going to place your blocks
1627.62,1635.72, by your inches so for a bad man it ithout we would do
1635.78,1649.94, close because for me i don't know this is like one of the biggest back bends and it it can be very intense like motions that's why i chose that and i'll give lots of options
1649.94,1681.32, and you can do which every one's most comfortable for you along the way the tube with the intensity of this pose you know without do it in a way that safe for you but just allow yourself to open to the intensity of the post because that's what we're doing with emotions to be with the direct experience of the post without trying to back away from it and whatever way accessible for you so let's start with just placing your hands on your hips lacing your shoulders
1681.8,1683.48, you told
1684.26,1690.59, and lifting your heart and your throat to the ceiling
1690.95,1694.76, if you cut blocks behind you
1694.94,1698.21, he could be sure hands
1698.3,1699.71, the blocks
1728.78,1733.88, i guess this is where they usually get out 
1733.97,1742.07, he began at blakeney way sorry kalil bit around
1742.19,1743.12, he
1743.84,1749.03, i could hear but were in the in the middle of telling a yoga show here
1749.21,1755.03, and then you're going to come forward and resting to alma
1781.73,1782.6, he
1784.58,1785.63, he
1785.87,1797.15, and then we're going to come and do cowslips this is also a very intense pose for a lot of people because its rat into the hips
1800.3,1804.71, the way there drinking the water
1817.7,1823.1, the rondo horsefaces pose in this can also be another very intense
1824.21,1826.55, posed for your hips
1826.55,1834.26, he can place a block or a bull stern aneath your hips if their tight will start with their
1835.7,1842.81, not going to marry you to day i designate with your right leg on top of your life and have your
1843.83,1848.09, strap close by poveri childer
1848.18,1858.53, he continually rotate your left arm placed it up your back and then you bretonnerie or up in over and hold on
1858.56,1871.16, i thought we did the full expression of cows face today that we were opening our hearts in her and opening our hips as well for the full intensity of capaces
1900.35,1913.34, and then going to switch sides so that your left leg is on top of her right leg it any space underneath your hips to fill it with a block or a cushion
1913.85,1919.7, you strap over to your other shoulder mis timing intirely rotate your right
1920.24,1923.24, bring your right arm your back
1923.66,1927.05, and then you take your left arm up and over
1927.92,1931.31, if your fingers meet in the back grade if not that's why i got the strap
1931.46,1934.13, so strong emotions can
1934.13,1966.74, actually open the doors of awareness for us as redress they represent a point where are awakened nature is breaking through our story line to actually the emotions are cutting through or are discursiveness you know arts are story line the story that we tell ourselves about ourselves and are limited sense every emotion then becomes an open ended opportunity for immediate presence
1968.09,1988.64, when these strong emotions come up there a chance for us you notice they the kind of break through they ask us to stop the ask us to come into the present moment they ask us to experience things in a full body way so emotions are actually incredibly helpful
1988.64,1991.22, in our journey of awakening
2009.01,2018.58, a man a grain to release this pose neebody in the straw
