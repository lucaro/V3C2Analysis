131.16,143.19, running this clam shell so my art my amideo on you to but the obama's sia fake family no kayastha the
143.55,150.84, the threats the obama's faccia family find that i am what we go into all sorts of detail
151.11,152.37, on
153.0,170.88, what's going on with the first family we know as we established a baalam's ideas face i don't want to spend a lot of time on that today because we cover that ad nauseum take nine layer bird titivate from hawaii a stolen a stolen or
170.94,210.24, an interagency assigned social security number from connecticut beginning with the connecticut prefix zero four two obaa never lived in connecticut so where he got that social security number and when he's got a forge draft registration card with a two edged the red ink circle that they stamped it with at the post office it has a four digit year i should say nineteen eighty one nine eight zero but for some reason obama's the only guy in america with a two digit year it's an aero and it looks like they shock another stamp in half and flipped it upside down to get the eight zero to make it look like you registered in nineteen eighty so this guy's a total pony but
210.27,230.19, so for years every one is asking what's going on where is he really form as you from indonesia can he doesn't look like his borniche the hospital that he was born at first he was born near than he for there is a big byron is book on it was bookcover says he's from tanya okay so nobody could figure out finally i realized
230.52,239.46, nobody you tryin always a foreign agent for china russia china russia cannot lock down the american media for eight years for almost a decade
239.55,244.41, a complete black got on who this guy is they can't do that a china and russia cannot
244.59,275.7, enforce a judicial blockade on any judicial courtroom challenges to who this guy is this take it and all that china russia can do that only an entity can do that and that's the intelligences of the united states if the cia did not want this to be happening if the pentagon of the financiers that are financing country did not want this god to run around with a pony nine layer but it imitate that looks like it was put together with elmer's glue and poultices sticks he wouldn't be doing it it wouldn't be getting away with it freest
275.85,282.84, so it's basically he's basically an inside job and why is he an inside job why is obaa an inside job well
282.87,291.45, very simple i describe it you can check on my article on light obaa the ultimate temp i finally realized
292.02,365.46, we were not going to go heavily into one even we both talk about island before today were not gone go into it heavily but we both agreed in eleven is not as represented on t wilmot agree at susette we can quibble about the details who was there which intelligencies played what role but we can agree it was copeland and it was not perpetrated by nineteen camel riding shades in a cave and afghanistan right an we ran at him as aufidius for the moment now if you stayed nine eleven from whatever reason may be you want to invigorate you'll want to lock down the united states with the his maybe you want to create your own thus domestic army of gain violation of the laws of this country may be you want to do all kinds of things maybe it cures all kinds of purposes once you do that you could you can do it but somebody eventually my figure out that its honeyed below the copper of nine eleven the pentagon is ahead of the game they have better information than we have they know they track social media they know how many people are digging into nine eleven they know how many people roughly believe nine eleven was phony as then as that number grows
366.54,382.65, now as that number grows okay as as more and more folks realize nine eleven was pony the pentagon had a decision to make they have to predict when folks are going to wake up a bonnie eleven and go ballistic when the american people are going to go hard wild and grabbed the pitchforks
382.74,453.36, when you're preparing for the election you have a choice of who you are going to run for president you can't put chunars in their as president could chuck noises basically an eagle scout and he's going to get half way through these tomater he's elected he's going to get away through the top secret nine eleven reports realized the whole thing realized how they stayed so then it is going to go was going to listen he may not go public but he's going to throw some people in jail there's goin to be some fall out so many people are going to get punished in the thin cold fall apart a ideative you can't put in a total dirt bag like michael bloomberg why umberto smart to get installed in the oval office waiting for the other shore waiting for the american people to wake up about eleven panic three at grand the pitchfork dragged him out of the ovaries and hang him from a bridge to a bloomer smart for that lumber didn't get this far by selling the most girl scout cookies bloomberg got this far by being a clever little crook and being in cahoots with the financiers the runenberg stays afloat and that's why he has bonesetting now so if you can't put a good guy chuck north and he can't put a bad guy
453.39,456.9, bloomberg in the oval office who who do you get
457.17,512.31, would you get you get a typical sea a recoiling from overseas somewhere ceitful all over the world you pull one of your sea guys that's not doing anything vital and you tell listen you're going to come over here we're going to put you novelist we tell you while we are in the back off as you're goin to be the front man while we are in the back off a shredding the documents and you're goin to sign some executive orders to bury the evidence they can bury them in eleven in evidence here going to bury the evidence of the other all the other of that siren okay and that's why i think he's here he doesn't know how long he's going to be here for wake up a month from now the vanished kaytherine sent air force one nobody is in it but they said that out over the pacific of the lankiness or you know sibilation laden shoots down should stand air force one with a stinger missile and they float and blue and white races in the ocean and no babies down it's a fake but it's like the bin laden killing
512.31,519.93, you know it's just a fake but they got away with it okay and folks and that explains it then retire bamberillo pakistan
