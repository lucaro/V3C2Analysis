49.65,52.02, today's part three in our series
52.02,63.81, garrison of our life groups are also doing this study during the week and homes and so i've made some discussion questions that you can down load on our website at our oldchurch or you can pick up a copy
63.84,72.27, in the welcome center if you're not in a life group you can give more information about that also out of our welcome center of leisure in check that out
72.33,83.01, mission of the church at or go is the lead people into a growing relationship with jesus christ that's why we're here we believe that is important for all of us to connect with other people
83.07,93.06, we think that the best place to do that is in a life group we believe that it's important for all of us to use our time and our talents to serve our community
93.15,113.04, we believe that is important for all of us to be generous giver and that we should invest in the lives of others in a vithered involved in a good church just like our goatherd here garrison know we usually don't think about guardroom until we need one
113.61,124.56, guard rail is a system that's designed to protect us to keep us from drifting into danger zones that's what a guard rail does
125.04,134.25, a guard rail is designed to keep the damage from not being as bad as it could have been if we would hit what's on the other side
134.37,135.87, the guard
136.53,143.52, i just turned and my first car like many people back in my era was a table
144.36,150.75, i just got in from basketball practice one night and i remember my mom asked me if i could go to the store and pick up some milk
150.93,155.85, of course when you first started driving your always happy to go drop somewhere so i having to the store
155.88,161.7, this bright idea in the way that a storm maybe i got stopped by this cheer leaders house that i've been warning as out
162.66,169.32, so i did that so i poured into her neighborhood and just as i'm pulling into the neighborhood i thought now wait a minute on the world of my doing
169.59,173.67, i've got what we call the cold feet you've had the cold feet
174.54,189.06, so i thought let me just let me just turn around and go on to the store and so it was dark and so in the street i thought i could just back up and over and turn around and head out of the neighborhood and go to the store and so
189.12,194.01, reverse and i started to back up and next thing i know i'm sitting upside down in the car
195.09,199.8, i had backed up into a ten foot ditch and flipped the car over
200.7,201.9, there in the dark
202.44,206.79, now this is way before cellphone or even thought of so
206.97,210.6, i think i was called out of the car
210.75,213.42, to her house knock on the door
213.72,218.28, as if i could borrow the phone call home and get dad to come help me
218.61,224.07, so i did that and of course the mean time i had to think of some excuse to tell her what i'm doing on her street
224.61,226.5, first place
227.34,233.49, now usually we don't pay much attention to guard rails until we need one now that road
233.94,236.61, at a garret
236.82,239.43, there would have been a garral
240.09,245.91, i would have backed my car into that gaius tapped it with my bumper and i would have stopped
246.33,249.99, i would have kept me from backing into that ditch
250.32,254.61, there would have been a guard rail i would not have for my car all up
254.67,256.41, more importantly
256.62,263.46, would not have damaged my reputation with the cheerleader if there had been a guardrail
265.41,272.22, the interesting fact about guardrails guard rails are never put in the danger zone they are always placed
272.43,275.85, several feet away from the dangers of
275.97,280.92, you will always find guardrails and an area that is actually safe
281.4,284.07, to drive so
284.37,290.34, if we were to consider putting up garb rails and our life in areas to protect us
290.4,291.48, from
291.51,297.87, danger zones and our life one if we were to put up guardrails in our relationships
298.5,305.97, we were to put up financial garbies one if we were to put up guardrails four hour dating
306.15,310.02, our morality for our ethics
310.44,318.09, what if we were to put up some guard rails a safe distance away from danger zones and our life
318.51,322.35, so here's our definition for those type
322.53,329.55, guards that we could put up in our life to protect us a personal code of conduct
329.88,331.89, i connected
332.16,333.48, my heart
333.75,336.81, it's a personal code of conduct because it
336.87,343.44, just for you in something that you decide on this isn't the law for everyone
343.65,346.23, these are things that are specific
346.5,349.26, for you and then it's connected
349.47,355.86, your heart this means that this personal code is something that you are so committed to yourself
355.92,363.72, becomes a matter of the heart that if you bump up against this guard rail that it actually bothers you
365.16,367.02, here's the goal
367.17,373.92, this series that we will develop some personal codes of conduct that we will establish some personal
373.92,376.53, guard rails and our life to protect us
377.1,387.36, that instead of doing some things that are wrong that we know will hurt us that we take some steps back and put up some guard rails that will keep us
387.57,389.91, of the danger zone
389.97,391.2, life
391.98,394.17, here's the truth
394.5,398.01, your greatest mistake financially
398.67,400.68, a mistake
400.68,403.56, rationally morally
403.71,405.27, spiritually
406.47,411.54, greatest mistake that you've made probably could have been avoided
411.99,415.02, you would have had guard rails
415.32,416.67, in your life
416.76,420.54, this is what makes it so tough sometimes our culture
420.84,424.83, will not help us with this in fact our culture will lead us right
424.83,428.46, the edge and then when we drive off of the bridge
429.06,431.34, they will criticize us for it
431.79,436.05, so it has to become a matter of personal
436.05,437.58, responsibility
440.07,448.71, i should ask if something is a sin or not the better question is since i know that there's some stuff out there
449.1,453.21, can hurt me and heard those that i love
453.36,461.46, better question to ask us where cannot put up some guard rails to protect me a personal code of conduct
461.58,464.79, is connected to my heart
465.21,473.25, think we all agree that it's possible for us to go too far that there is some lines that we should not cross
473.4,474.63, financially
475.11,476.34, morally
476.76,479.61, our marriage in our relationships
479.67,482.58, so the best question for us to ask
482.58,486.99, what can we do to keep from drifting into
487.02,490.02, danger and that's what we call
492.51,497.01, the scriptures that we've been talking about that we want to remember to help us
497.07,504.03, we try to establish these guard rails and our life now these words were written by the wisest man
504.24,507.51, ever lived proverbs chapter four
507.72,519.06, verse above all else above all else guard your heart you say i don't know about this guard real stuff with the wisest man who ever lived
519.21,521.16, the guard
521.19,522.42, heart
522.57,528.54, above all else guard your heart for everything you do flow from it
529.32,531.9, then proverbs chapter 
531.96,537.42, verse three to day all of us can choose to be in one of two groups
537.96,541.32, i see danger ahead and avoid it
542.04,544.62, but fools keep going
545.16,546.96, get into trouble
548.1,552.78, one of the places that you can find darrells on the road is on
552.87,562.5, medians cause at median people are moving very close each other but they're going in opposite directions which is very
562.71,564.18, dangerous
565.05,567.09, we're going to talk about
567.15,570.15, friendships in our life
570.57,576.27, going to find that we are moving very close to some people
576.78,578.25, friends
578.34,579.84, co workers
580.11,590.4, that we go to school with people that we hang with you're going to find that your very close to some people that in their lives or moving in a direction that is different
590.58,591.99, from yours
592.05,593.61, and when that happens
594.18,602.49, you will need to have some guard rails in place or they may take you in that opposite direction with them
603.12,606.57, all of us know a story of somebody
606.63,610.29, whose life was massed up by hanging with people
610.38,612.36, a different values
612.9,614.73, morals
614.79,617.25, different direction in life
617.82,622.92, this problem of being too close to people who are moving in the opposite direction
623.01,626.85, problem began for most of us when we were kids
627.6,634.71, many of us grew up in a home where our parents made a big bill about the people that we hung out with
635.1,637.59, we couldn't understand it as a kid
637.8,641.49, parents would say something like you can't go to his house
642.42,644.58, you can't go to her house
645.18,647.73, not spending the night over there
648.54,651.12, we never could understand why
651.48,656.28, parents understood a very very important principle
656.58,660.69, that friends have a big influence
660.84,663.06, our life its true
663.21,667.53, our friends can actually determine the direction
667.62,669.45, the quality

684.45,685.95, here's the thing
686.1,691.68, friendship the thing that makes friendship so also is the same thing that makes friendship
691.89,694.2, so dangerous
694.8,696.66, with a friend
696.87,699.18, i dropped my guard
699.84,703.59, reason that were attracted to certain people
703.68,708.78, that because all of us want to be excepted
709.53,712.74, we are driven away by rejection
713.1,715.62, we are attracted to
717.42,720.63, and when i'm with people who accept me
720.81,722.46, drop my guard

748.59,752.82, around me i shut down around rejection
753.6,755.4, open up
755.49,760.05, around acceptance that's what makes friendship so also

1115.22,1119.6, what will happen to morrow and the day after to morrow
1120.08,1121.4, the fool
1121.7,1123.98, live for to day
1128.3,1132.14, you with people who live as if life
1132.2,1139.82, elated and make decisions as if life is related that will impact your world view

1145.76,1148.52, business your reputation your family
1149.0,1150.2, everything
1150.23,1151.97, the promise

1154.82,1156.77, the friends of fools
1157.28,1158.42, suffer
1159.05,1163.49, warning is not if you spend time with fools you will become
1163.61,1167.12, fool this is where we get messed up with it
1167.87,1176.09, time with the words i will become wise and so we assume that if we spend time with fools will become a fool but that's not what solomon
1176.3,1177.83, teaching here
1178.16,1180.2, warning of this first
1180.23,1190.61, the friends of fools the person who does life with fools will eventually become impacted by the fool
1193.22,1200.54, you may spend your entire life hanging out with foolish people but never behave the way the fools
1201.95,1207.2, eventually the mass that will happen from a foolish behavior
1207.35,1213.29, whether you adopt their way of thinking or not will affect you
1213.77,1215.96, here's why that's so important
1216.35,1225.17, some of us have tried to defend unhealthy relationships this way we said but i'll never do
1225.23,1226.64, they do
1227.09,1231.74, i'll never think the way that they think so i'm safe
1232.58,1234.77, solomon says you're wrong
1234.98,1244.31, cause the friends of fools wherever you act away they act whether you think the way they think you will eventually suffer
1245.06,1247.07, a full behavior
1247.58,1254.66, here's what a fool is a fool is a person who knows the difference between right and wrong
1254.93,1256.43, they don't care
1256.67,1263.39, you say to a full don't you know that what you're doing will lead you into trouble and they say ye
1263.6,1265.49, it's all going to work out
1266.12,1272.33, in fact the scripture says he not even try to correct the full because they'll just laugh at you
1272.84,1274.1, care
1274.52,1278.9, you can't say to a fool don't you know how this will impact your marriage
1279.53,1280.91, doesn't care
1281.45,1283.04, live for today
1283.1,1285.59, they have an excuse for everything
1287.93,1290.9, if you hang with people who just don't care
1290.99,1294.71, and if you live as if life is not related
1295.28,1297.47, as a friend of fools
1297.8,1300.02, solomon says you will suffer
1300.92,1303.92, now that doesn't sound very loving
1304.22,1306.32, compassionate does it
1306.59,1312.56, are we supposed to have friends who are different from us so that we can help them
1313.91,1316.64, yes and we're all about that
1317.27,1321.05, as a church for people who don't like church
1321.35,1328.07, people who are far from god who are trying to find their way and figure that out that's what we're all about
1328.34,1329.9, as a church
1329.93,1332.75, and we want to help those who don't know god
1333.26,1334.88, here's the thing
1335.0,1338.06, never confused compassion
1338.66,1340.04, with the
1340.55,1345.17, passion will never require you to make an unwise choice
1345.32,1346.85, about yourself
1347.24,1349.97, and when we use compassion
1350.0,1355.49, love as an excuse to make an unwise choice that's not real compassion
1356.96,1359.84, no conflict between compassion
1360.65,1361.94, and wisdom
1362.33,1365.03, but you say i love this person
1365.3,1368.99, care about these people i want to help them
1369.83,1371.24, and that's also
1371.39,1375.23, but the best thing that you can do for a person you love
1375.5,1382.79, best thing that you can do for friends that you care about is for you to stay on the right side
1382.79,1384.38, the guard rail
1384.65,1390.05, so that when they crash you will be healthy enough
1390.23,1392.93, actually helped them
1393.77,1396.65, so leave you a few suggested
1396.8,1399.41, guards to help protect you
