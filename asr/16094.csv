0.81,6.09, steve anderson and then the video essay i'll be discussing history and time
6.48,15.36, the video say is about ten minutes in length and by the end we should have a good understanding of the ways that societies have viewed the concept of time throughout history
15.96,23.61, studying how societies time can help us understand the more fully and he can give us a better view of her own society as well
24.57,33.66, the video clip from the movie fourteen ninety two conquests of paradise a giant bell is being hoisted into the new church built by christopher columbus
33.81,40.14, the bearing throughout each day giving the time for meals and prayers as well as for work and labour
40.47,48.87, the bell is an instrument of christianity within the church and it is also an instrument of colonialism imperialism and even capitalism
49.35,59.91, this bill will restructure the lives of the indigenous peoples labouring for columbus and the spanish empire and that will reinforce what it means to be christian for other spaniards living in the new world
60.24,70.8, eaton
75.99,77.46, he
105.84,111.54, as from a book of hours which is a collection of prayers and the times of day they should be said
112.05,117.03, the summit comes from a french book created just before columbus sailed for the new world
117.48,124.77, these books were designed to help people keep track of their daily lives which for many in this era included agricultural labor
125.28,130.11, with this image where at our first point of reference for understanding historical time
130.29,136.26, the enterprises a god's time which can also be called agricultural or natural time
136.32,141.81, it relies on the seasons the rising and setting of the sun and the rhythms of nature
142.68,156.45, second type of time will be discussing called machine time or railroad time comes into effect with the industrial revolution across the seventeen hundred and eighteen hundred and the processes of mechanization and mass production
156.84,162.33, with the advent of the railroad god's time could no longer keep pace and it was far from accurate
163.02,169.86, railroad conductors arrived in other places they might see that their own watches were thirty minutes different from the clocks and that town
169.89,178.59, that would make it quite difficult to keep schedule especially considering how many new roots were being developed to ship both goods and people to distant places
178.83,189.93, in addition to the problem of accuracy with nearby towns far away cities could be experiencing different times of day it might have been mid day in chicago at the same time it was afternoon in new york
190.11,199.77, times owned such as eastern central and pacific standard were invented by the railroads to help remedy this disparity something we tend to take for granted now
200.76,205.95, the early a peculiar thing about time was discovered by albert einstein
206.16,210.66, until einstein theories of relativity time was thought to be fixed
210.69,218.16, i mean it was always a minute no matter where you were or how fast you are travelling and it had been this way since the time of isaac newton
218.61,229.53, with instant of theories however time was seen as fluid and somewhat messy space and time were intermixed and subject to unseen forces that helped shape the universe
230.58,236.52, in the semillante salvador dolly created the persistence of memory
236.55,241.32, a painting that destroys the supposed fixity and determines the qualities of time
241.68,246.57, dolly's painting shows pocket watches or small clocks melting amidst the dreams cape
246.81,250.29, the watches have lost all function and yet they still exist
250.29,255.48, perhaps in a state of decay with flies and ants testing and inspecting their surfaces
256.08,262.29, hundreds of years time was seen as invariable and changeless and suddenly it became nearly unknowable
262.47,268.89, to help remedy the uncertainty of time incarnation has become more and more important in modern society
269.13,278.61, we onesicrates to antonina he's got french to me it will be midnight and fifteen seconds to
282.3,285.75, synchronizing watches were for small groups of people
285.84,287.79, but what about larger groups
288.09,291.36, columbus's bell provided synchronization in the new world
291.45,296.97, and the bell tower shone here at us riverside and corporate both bells and clock
297.66,305.64, the bell tower is a hybrid timekeeper i met that for synchronizing the pace and movements of an entire university campus
306.18,315.15, the bell tower was constructed in the nineteen sixties and its multiple bells which form a musical instrument called a caroline are wrong throughout the day
315.45,324.66, for the person operating the caroline which is sort of like an organ with bells instead of pipes the bell tower provides a commanding view of the campus and the surrounding area
324.96,330.54, a few students at our even joked that it reminds them of the eye of sovran in lord of the rings
330.57,334.5, a tower used for synchronization as well as surveillance
335.04,347.34, i am the pietratesta more benign power in london that you might be familiar with
347.4,352.23, which is actually the name of the great belt inside the elizabeth tower
352.86,362.4, as we moved to our lecture here you may notice remember other time pieces bells and clock towers and especially the familiar notion of time always running out
362.55,364.62, even in fairy tales
365.25,384.39, oh my goodness what is the matter it's a night jes so in his perfidy on weight you can't go now it's so listless a but why well i i the prince i have met the prince of prince
384.96,395.31, you know by the way come back please come back i don't even know your name he amind to wait
399.06,406.86, one should know the day this photo was taken at the satellite image of manhattan new york on september eleventh two thousand one
407.13,411.21, a moment in history where everything seemed to change but why
411.3,415.65, and what does nine eleven have to do with time be and towers
415.98,422.4, before the terrace attacks the world trade center consisted of two towers on the twin towers
422.7,431.07, while there were no bells that wrong or giant clocks on the sides of these buildings these structures still operated as instruments of synchronization
431.67,437.97, the twin towers were at the heart of wall street tied directly into digital networks of global finance
438.54,445.89, when the terror destroyed the world trade center and the twin towers they were attempting to destroy a system of synchronization
446.43,453.96, the terrace attacks of nine eleven only happened in the united states but their impact on world markets reverberated across the globe
455.55,461.52, to the third and last type of time will be discussing atomic or digital time
461.64,469.77, most so called atomic clocks we see on a daily basis like the one here on the right side of the image are actually just radio receivers
469.98,475.71, real atomic clocks are delicate scientific instruments like the enormous device on the left
476.55,483.96, a time at clocks were invented in the nineteen forties using the oscillations of atomic particles for incredibly accurate time keeping
484.29,497.46, around the same time that atomic clocks were developed the digital computer was invented and main frame computers of such as the unfathered helped bring the united states as well as the rest of the world into the digital age
497.97,503.64, but what happens when the time clocks anticipates are used in conjunction with one another
503.73,509.28, how would regular consumers and every day people experienced accuracy of digital time
510.12,517.38, smart phones like to phone and android are the way most people experience the network effects of digital synchronization these days
517.5,525.03, apples i phones and goods andrew devices are manufactured in the millions and millions and distributed throughout the world
526.35,530.04, the bell tower this tower is also a hybrid
530.28,537.09, rather than bells in a clock though this tower or sell tower as a clock and wireless network in equipment
537.75,542.07, stars are literally everywhere especially in urban areas
542.52,548.52, perhaps it's the ubiquitous nature of the cell tower that makes people want to disguise them however poorly
548.97,560.4, perhaps we've moved too far from god's time and through the uncertainty of machine time in the camouflage of salt towers as pine trees and palm trees is an attempt to move back to nature
560.7,564.9, or may be even as with this sallower closer to god
