47.46,55.41, so for years we've been thinking about consciousness in the way that we have and
55.53,58.71, to my to pleasure
58.89,89.46, that these things have worked out as mentioned earlier we've been going through a few different dynamic changes of any organization itself as a director and signorelli and the brookings institute an assure you my compatriot here at everything that you've seen here so far is just beginning so i'd like to
90.15,96.9, we talk about design often ah at some point during
96.93,99.33, a human lifetime
99.42,112.41, they will use the word design and that a big deal aside from the and the and the and in various languages
112.5,117.36, design is the fourth most popular word used
121.05,145.98, design was constructed we had the mesopotamian era and we all know how that was but sir but this is a anathematise it all you know is they say i've seen as much as i've seen
146.13,181.11, and so i've been collecting various tones if you will though ponders and the thing that i've landed upon the eminence detailed
181.38,187.05, crashes that song
192.21,198.27, how you stare listening
198.42,390.45, the renegade remuneration dedicated it belittled to intuitionalists or thereabouts teetotalists and other manoeuvres goetterdaemmerung
390.51,394.17, is without a doubt
394.47,400.41, and it has been that way 
402.36,406.02, long enough to be here and
406.8,411.66, what i've learned through optic is innumerable
412.35,419.07, immeasurable inconsistent constance
419.34,421.38, in
421.5,423.09, a
423.96,425.82, incongruous
426.33,431.13, feeling no
431.13,445.32, these are two of the inalienable nanadabadian over it and reaffirmation the ersite
445.32,461.91, he is a low and design and clad on some charm to show to the ethereal nor so partly sure at all a son she tennesseean rising
462.0,474.9, no he's
475.26,483.99, in the unity of the holy practice
484.26,504.66, and here we go but butler
505.11,604.11, the jacobean down banishing the sparrow now abomination on but you timanyoni
604.32,650.82, we may live being in a mansion to sarsaparilla were here i met by never really answered patiently options given lapointe in order us to i must reactionaries
654.72,680.46, the theatin the cooperative we heard enough of that the nineties okay listen
680.52,682.59, i want to talk to you about a couple
682.77,689.34, relatively real issues 
689.4,701.67, people wrote in on email a couple of other forms of communication that essentially are all the same thing but just branded different names
706.65,708.09, in
708.6,710.28, an innovation
710.52,720.87, to itself at one point an ovation didn't exist someone had to create some kind of a word that
720.99,728.76, created the feeling that it feels like to hear the word that we hear when we hear innovation
731.19,740.13, on sword that's only been around in the english vocabulary for years a lot of people don't know that and if you did know that
740.28,747.33, that's great
748.2,755.34, now we all know that poverty is super easy to fix and
756.69,761.04, using madula dynamics
761.43,765.84, can recreate unfold re sequence understand
765.84,768.18, reshape the way we think
768.42,781.65, thought itself by constantly monitoring thought itself it will not only lead you know where it will give you a headache
782.07,784.14, so try not to do that
785.1,786.3, instead
786.33,809.79, try to do something that's way outside of the box like some place that if you were to see how far away from the box you were you wouldn't even be able to tell what that box was any more compared to the landscape that your comparing it against getting outside of the box is more than just getting out of a box and walking away
815.1,822.6, children know sometimes boxes are very difficult to get out of
823.5,826.95, why is it any different for us
827.79,833.25, between glass ceilings dirt floors and boxes
833.28,844.89, we need to know that a bottom up approach is not only an approach that starts from somewhere that we believe to be the bottom but an approach that was painted by several painters
844.98,851.04, the edges and the hatch that led us to understand
851.58,853.5, where can we be
853.89,867.36, some time in the future from now and i can guarantee you you will move at least feet within the next hour i can guarantee that and i have algorithms that can divine and predict that
868.35,876.87, movement prediction patterns heroical samples that have been taken throughout the entire time that you've been here
879.18,883.32, of course the common spectral analysis
883.41,899.91, we know that everything here is illusion and that we are somewhere else but the cool thing about that is it feels pretty real i mean you know i mean like it's a pretty convincing so
900.9,908.25, credit to those those people working hard there so
912.72,914.34, a demain
914.58,915.96, simple answer
916.86,918.36, cause
918.84,931.62, because i mean because has been in at least one sea and a couple of towels this combination of letters and bowls together
931.8,947.34, create a fairly pronounceable word gives us the strength and the power as individuals and as human beings to see within ourselves not only the triumph of remorse of those who have compelled against us in a way that does not
947.85,953.1, necessarily benefit us in the long term but give us the strength in the mid term
953.1,958.38, show how the reversal of those rules of which we have come fairly accustomed to let
958.86,967.8, at that to acquiesce and reform and remote the world around us
968.97,978.66, internally were pretty gross there's a lot of liquid and tissues and things and its pretty gross to think about
979.2,1045.59, so i would like to this is a song that like to dedicate to all the gross things that we are walking around and also just a celebration of all of you guys here the people up there as well to forget them the some people behind the walls as well walking around and doing things as well and there's some people buying here is actually four people running the entire show technically that's it there's just four people they can divide into five people per person so there seems to be a lot of people back there but they're all being controlled by one central consciousness okayondonghsera

1236.72,1248.63, from my last song that you like you think you very much 
1249.11,1255.53, people talk like this proposal superabundant
1255.8,1287.48, we quickly like to thank optician the first person to think opulence it's been an awesome right i mean like you know the first time i came here i met some ridiculous people and a second time more ridiculous people
1287.69,1377.09, keeps getting ridiculous her but it's a disarming constitution of people around you but also not only knowing that whoever you're talking to even a volunteer oftentimes we're talking to a volunteer someone who has a sign on them that says volunteer and you talking to them and you find out that they like a theoretical physicist that works at some laboratories near like what i think that's important to realize every person in the world around you is relationless youthhead over again which we classify as often i feel as though the iraqi sunset setting him over my mind which indicates that the world is going to be a pretty cool place at some point and then it's goin to be horrible again but then it's going to be really cool and is going to be not so good and then they'll be pretty decent for a while and it's going to be a
1377.57,1386.96, all that the engine reality but that gets us a little bit stronger so with that knowledge that i've gotten from anne amazing to case which i still have
