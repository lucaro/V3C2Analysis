0.06,94.53, what nobody the assumption behind the series a meakin of quick hits in and out we want to do a quick little project based learning exercise and then let you get on your way and start doing your own damage but the idea behind this is it's intended for people who are just getting started with rime you download trial and you're staring at a blank screen trying to figure out what to do maybe you've had right off for a little while and you haven't made as much progress as you wanted there's something that's got stock or maybe you just start neanderthaler talking about really bickersteth is stationed we're going to take some questions and men will talk about export resources training options and best practices and all that kind of stuff so this is me my mail address is killing the eccomi also the owner of the outside digital are design which is at the outside but i am a price designer with twenty years and experience i went to center for creative studies in tetraides
94.56,122.34, and we're very briefly as a atmosizer and then pop over into the product design field and i spent most of my time in the toy and entertainment industry i mentioned a train or an attack for nellie a lot of the level to training i do some of the level one training i've got some videos out i've got an infinite skill video out a few things like that so so what are you to use were going to use the right use guile
122.58,126.57, i website under the learn
128.7,151.62, if you go to the lean to and then look at the rinsers guide missus chapter eighteen which is intended to be a self guided tutorial and in this ticular case i'm going to be your guide so sonerell about how to get this going if we look at the users guitaut the sand
151.62,218.31, before in the users got you'll notice there's a top view in a side view if you write click on this you should be able to save this image as i usually just pop these on my desk top so this will come in his driving lapraik on miss savagedom in dragon fly side gay so that's the first thing that we're going to want to do and then that is that's standard behavior for any ebbage if you go to any we page of the picture on it you can write click on it and say that picture as i usually just pop him on my desk tops of their easy to find so at we're going to do were intake these two images and we're going to use this to break the fear of clean sheet of paper syndrome right that that fears an artist you get when you're looking at a clean sheet of paper thinking oh boy what am i what am i doing here so we're going to use those to step some reference in heorot
219.84,230.19, expand i doublequick on again it will go back to its forty substantiate we haven't taught you image sets round the picture frame command
230.67,232.56, a type that in the screen
232.68,235.62, and go to the desk top and
236.7,245.01, go to the dragon fly top image and i'm just going to click and i'm going to hold down this shift key and you'll notice that the shift key
245.01,249.93, from spinning around on me right so if i did hold the ship keat's going to bring it in straight
249.99,261.48, and this little bit so drag this said that it is fairly lined up and you can even use the ice pans of the reference plane
263.31,266.76, guide to kind of lots lay it down kind of rite
267.63,270.87, on the origin right that seems to make sense
270.99,272.28, so
272.43,277.53, this is great but the image is a little bright it's a little 
278.22,279.93, a little to
280.23,284.64, like to like to mute it back a little bit so it's not
284.79,296.46, so i mean quick on the object i'm going to go to my property tabor here and you'll notice that there's a material but little to be pathetic that
296.46,307.17, you'll see that material is listed as picture frame well i slide down here to expand the little bit seared it transparency
307.62,308.85, i can just
308.88,310.11, bring this
310.26,312.78, down to effect
313.23,317.07, bright or dim that images may be usually
317.13,318.63, something like this
318.72,324.9, i don't want it to be super crazy bright so i'm just going to drop it something somewhere around for a minority per cent
325.23,327.27, see that that becomes a little dimmer
328.59,330.57, of the perspective view
330.81,335.79, and just to get it out of the way i'm going to drag it down using tumble
335.79,342.36, it's out of the way right out of my modeling envelope here but if i go back to my top view
342.36,355.65, still placed in topeka so doing while so far right but her first reference in it now for organizational purposes what a typically like to do as i liked to lay my images so let's go to the layer pale
355.8,361.68, double click on that and let's change this too top image
361.8,365.16, and then i'm goin to pick this object rightlier
365.43,367.32, change the object are
367.86,372.09, the benefit of this is i can turn it on her off
372.09,373.29, easily
373.71,382.47, the other benefit is i can lock it and now i'm not going to accidentally select it right so it's literally just a reference in age floating in space now
382.68,384.63, i can turn on or turn off
384.66,385.8, i want
386.22,389.22, socrate front go
389.25,393.24, and let's do this again picture frame
393.39,398.82, and let's do drag any side and now in this case i'm going to snap
398.88,407.61, edges of that image i'm going to assume that these images were set up to be scaled correctly if they are great if they're not no big deal
407.94,410.25, then i'm going to pull this somewhere
410.4,411.57, again
411.78,425.52, origin to perspective view i minnelied this back in space again i just want to keep the origin kind of clean from this kind of stuff because i want to be able to see it but i don't want it to get in the way
426.3,427.77, later it
430.95,433.56, that changed the object are
436.05,438.0, then let's alter it
438.0,439.89, back to our properties
440.01,444.42, i can to transparency up a little bit again somewhere about fifty per cent
444.87,446.4, back to our lair
446.49,448.98, then lock it so
449.01,456.3, he just escaped from the trap of clean sheets and droplight we have reference images we can work for from now
457.11,458.64, so
458.94,468.45, we've got that done let's go ahead and start drawing some objects so if we go to top view
470.58,472.62, and i soon a little bit
472.65,475.32, draw the profile
475.53,479.16, burnouse the curb command that
479.19,481.95, and i'm going to start
482.97,485.82, and somewhere there
486.45,489.06, i'm not even going to worry about mailing this down
489.69,491.13, the center line yet
492.09,495.87, a little trick and rites three points to make a corner
496.86,497.88, so
497.94,501.15, while you're doing this stuff think about that
502.47,513.51, so if i have a big corner to make instead of just did it indicating the thing right we don't want to do that nonsapient down
513.78,517.08, i want to kind o say o this is dipping in
517.26,521.64, so i've got one point already so let's say that's the middle of my death
521.88,525.6, and then i've got another point here which is the end of my beat
526.14,527.22, now
527.46,533.82, reversing right it's going the other direction so now i look at this is my first point this is my second point
533.85,535.59, maybe that's my third point
536.34,537.51, so on
537.75,538.89, it
541.89,544.83, then that way were creating
545.04,549.03, a little bit better curve
550.23,552.93, then we would have if we
553.56,560.19, just kept shotgun points down there all right and it excited that too soon so let's go ahead and do this again
561.96,563.7, i quickly
565.47,567.15, how i'm not
567.93,574.77, just blazing crazy with points i want to keep my curve
574.92,576.66, relatively
576.9,578.16, manageable
579.57,581.34, if i have
581.61,584.22, hundreds and hundreds of points down here
584.64,591.54, it's going to be difficult to manage i can always go back and turn my point on
591.75,593.55, little farther
594.0,596.91, to get more surface change
599.73,604.38, have to go nuts you want to try and get as much as you can
604.89,611.94, his few points as possible any time you can reduce the number of points yet still get
612.24,614.22, surface change that you want
614.34,615.54, do that
615.6,621.03, there was an old joke and a car community but calling chapman who is the
621.3,622.62, the
623.22,630.51, the head of lois cars when he used to make race cars they used to joke that he would design the car
631.02,639.57, and then he would keep taking pieces out and tell to make it lighter until it collapsed under its own weight and then it would put the one piece back in
639.63,643.35, that made it collects
643.59,645.99, that's true or not
646.02,657.57, the mentality is correct right you want to keep removing data removing points for moving information until the shape just falls apart and then you want to put that part back
657.57,664.35, so let's we've got that curve let's go ahead and mirror it
664.77,666.72, and i'm going to mirror it
667.35,672.69, by typing zero which is going to nail it down around the origin
673.02,674.52, you trick
674.79,676.14, this gap
676.17,682.38, means that this curve is not set up directly if i were to make a surface there'd be a whole
684.48,686.64, i did this
686.85,690.69, record history one should have at least was just double checked
691.56,700.68, so anything i do to my first curve is going to happen to my second her right i had history turned on always record an updated children
700.77,705.03, so i turned my points on her watch what happens i picked this and i move it
707.91,708.84, well
709.32,714.81, this if i pick this and i have reficit on
715.59,717.96, balls ponytail right here
718.02,723.48, i have this sent to snappy dragging instead of smooth driving which i believe is the de fall
723.51,725.88, i can drag this
725.97,727.35, hold down
728.58,732.27, and snap to snap this to hear
732.99,734.79, that's going to be
734.88,736.44, this part 
736.65,741.57, maybe now i move both of these back up here so i've just gotten rid of that point
741.57,742.56, that
742.68,745.41, still open and we'll fix that in a minute
745.86,747.81, the same thing down here
748.14,753.0, take this unless just snap it this is creating a tanging condition here
753.39,758.97, right so i take this now unless drag this in this direction
759.9,760.86, and
763.05,764.64, snap those
766.44,769.56, if i turn on the point this you'll notice
769.83,773.85, i missed it but watch this i can select both of these now
774.42,776.1, seltzer
776.67,780.06, average is them right back to the center line
780.12,784.29, this is a great trick this scale to zero if i pick both of these
784.59,796.8, on the handle and tight zero now i've just now but down i could also snap him cried i could start at the origin there's a bunch of different ways to do it but i really like this trick
797.7,800.13, take these three points
800.37,804.24, see how they're not lined up if i lick this
804.69,808.23, zero look at flattens it right out now i killed history
808.77,822.66, both points on the other side but that scale to zero trick i really like cassius taken this and we've made a nice symmetrical curve let's go to perspective view
822.69,824.73, start working on
825.12,826.2, the shape
827.13,831.72, before we knew that i need to do a little adjustment
833.22,837.72, you'll notice that this is kind of traveling right through this
838.44,844.5, no right this is not the shape is not quite right so it's turned a point on froth curves
845.04,850.32, pick these points and let use them and command
850.38,856.38, i love and because it allows you to make a really nice procedural
857.19,858.24, then
858.42,859.59, the point
860.16,865.98, make a nice really nice at it we could do that on the other hand to if we wanted to
865.98,870.24, called for in the book but if you wanted to do that you could
870.69,881.07, i was go back to the perspective view let's work on our profiles were on our side profile here so i mean it draweth here it
881.19,883.5, i mean to draw this bottom shape here
884.37,885.84, i start on a top
887.7,895.83, to use an oe snap to snap at the end point here in perspective view this is important because it allows me to like identify exactly where that is
896.19,897.75, i'm going to go back
898.26,901.86, the front view see how my curve stayed live
902.4,906.66, shift drag my first point so that it stays
906.81,909.57, relatively canon and then a minister
909.69,911.88, we here
913.56,916.11, and i'm going to start just tracing 
918.24,925.44, you may say well there's a lot more detail in that shape then your capturing with this curve
926.31,928.05, and that may be the case
928.95,932.22, what i'm trying to do is to generate
932.55,936.24, cure that will generate a surface
937.47,939.21, simple enough
939.54,946.26, i can then added and do some additional sculpting on some going to do the same thing but a snap this and point
946.65,948.78, essentially insurers
948.84,951.42, the cure that i just draw drew
951.69,954.36, i set out down the center line
955.53,960.27, back to the front view actually was going to perspective the on starter bottom curve
961.23,966.93, snap go back to front i have hockey set up for them to the views by the way
968.76,970.35, just start
974.1,975.9, in the states
978.36,985.56, don't need to go not at this point i don't need to machine guns ten thousand points onto this curve
991.26,994.98, just need to get something that you can use
995.16,999.87, i started point when i go to perspective you just to make sure that i'm catching at
1002.84,1005.57, the perspective
1006.17,1007.67, no state
1009.38,1010.94, now we've got
1011.54,1019.64, nice little wire frame set up here right we could do this a couple of different ways we can lock these curves together
1020.75,1026.9, we can use the low command and go on to the ore and then we could
1026.9,1029.45, change this normal
1029.54,1032.36, change is the closed
1032.42,1034.82, we'd get something like that right
1035.27,1036.47, bad
1037.64,1041.57, let's see we can do it if we can do one better
1042.41,1044.33, different command
1045.05,1048.14, called the sea sacros section command
1048.17,1061.1, kind of a cool command because what it does is it takes the curb information from rio and it creates like hall section so if we run see
1061.55,1072.11, and we're going to pick the profile curves in order right so this is important one to three for we wouldn't want to go one two three four because it would make it
1072.17,1082.76, both want to pick them in the right order it was counter clock wise and then let's go to the front bed and watched this i can just draw a line
1083.06,1084.65, to
1087.98,1089.42, bill
1089.9,1094.58, little cross sectional curves and you'll see it better when we get into
1096.89,1098.57, the space but
1099.5,1102.8, i can come in here and basically create
1108.5,1110.09, sections
1110.6,1112.19, i
1112.52,1114.11, shape of this thing
1116.57,1118.28, check that out
1119.21,1121.82, what odd was it created
1121.91,1123.32, in
1123.56,1126.98, around here and we've created a really nice little frame
1128.45,1133.7, there we can use the lock command to get a little different result check this out
1137.18,1140.39, make sure that you're clicking on the same side of the curve
1140.54,1142.4, i click over here
1142.49,1144.41, no it's 
1145.49,1148.4, send blastoff in a different direction
1148.76,1151.13, we can fix it but
1151.61,1154.79, click in about the same spot
1155.39,1157.61, cu'mae your life easier
1157.67,1164.39, see how this chain is running and all the arrows are going in the right direction if i had clicked over here
1164.42,1170.51, chain would go and are playing in the other direction we'd have to drag them over and then flip it
1170.81,1175.34, you can do that you can add it all these right i can change the direction
1175.4,1177.38, this thing in a quick on it
1178.49,1180.14, change where it is
1180.17,1181.49, i
1181.61,1182.66, on
1182.84,1183.92, the
1185.3,1192.83, flip i can flip this to a different direction but this case had aleurites were good men right click to accept
1193.04,1196.85, we're going to change this to normal
1199.31,1204.05, let's not simplify and see what happens so many ipomeas
1204.38,1212.96, each one of those same francis going to be represented by a row of points that's going to be way to crazy to try and edit to try and do anything with
1217.19,1222.95, it it look at how much simpler the surface is now you can say well you lost some detail will sure
1222.95,1224.24, that's fine
1224.48,1227.78, we can also add and subtract detail
1228.02,1231.86, we get there so he uses as a base of some one of us say okay
1232.94,1236.6, not secure
1236.75,1242.18, and hide them or even better let's do this
1244.43,1246.14, make occurs later
1246.8,1251.57, change the objects to our curvature again and then let us hide up
1252.56,1254.03, i've got
1254.51,1256.07, single surface
1257.81,1259.07, police
1260.06,1261.89, i can then turn on
1265.01,1267.92, i can add it this thing and i can start sculping it
1268.4,1271.1, i can come in here go to wire friend
1272.24,1273.62, i can start
1275.24,1277.76, pushing needs points
1278.84,1283.64, get some more details i can add a little fold her by any putitover
1284.51,1286.64, shift dragonade
1288.8,1289.94, that out
1291.08,1293.78, can start making these little full details
1295.73,1301.4, useful tools in here if i pick one and i to itself
1305.39,1308.45, i can come around and i can get all of
1308.45,1311.75, points then i can start
1312.44,1313.91, and pushing
1314.57,1317.42, and sculpting and do what i'm doing whatever i want
1317.66,1319.19, i can start
1319.97,1321.65, this kind of stuff
1321.68,1325.25, the closer together those curbs are going to light up
1325.49,1328.16, pushing farther apart they're going to loosen up
1331.76,1335.45, i grab a hold seaman
1335.72,1337.46, all of these
1341.63,1343.1, got them all
1344.45,1347.6, i scale to zero watch what happens
1350.93,1353.0, all together that way
1353.27,1354.92, scale to zero
1356.81,1358.4, that way
1359.36,1360.83, scale
1361.43,1364.43, together to a point just closed up the end
1365.9,1368.42, just the position of this and
1369.05,1370.91, i can soften it up
1371.27,1373.01, a nice rounded
1376.16,1380.27, and then i can stretch it pull it do it over alone to it
1381.83,1383.15, just these
1385.22,1386.81, the idea
1387.65,1390.77, i closed up the end of that
1392.93,1399.59, a few more little segment things in her skill is out a little bit and under
1404.03,1410.03, scale this one at little bit is where the art part of it starts to come in you can start
1410.69,1413.24, messing with the stuff and see
1415.52,1416.99, feels
1420.02,1425.24, like your doing it caretakin of will segmented body
1428.12,1432.41, to call it a wetona with it but
1433.22,1437.3, we can pull out this they think down here whatever that is
1443.0,1448.94, great snow we can adjust that and get it to be all nice and unlike
1450.89,1452.36, but it was me still
1454.61,1463.52, so be please explain a little more as actually self like victory and when you have points
1463.67,1466.52, there is a direction
1466.52,1474.5, right if i were to sell out a pick and type call you it picks all of the points in the direction
1474.74,1477.5, if i were to pick so 
1477.71,1483.8, is all of the points in this direction so there's two commands sell you and sell the
1484.31,1504.35, if i pick a point depending on which when i enter i'll either get a whole row in the direction or a whole row in the beaker action that how the directions on a surface or car computing the reason that they have a unoffered is the surface may not be oriented in the same orientation as the ex wise
1504.47,1508.19, the construction plan so this is the construction plan
1508.19,1510.98, this is oriented and exit space
1511.28,1514.19, surface may be oriented
1514.73,1520.4, this rain so this is not ex wise space and now i need a different way
1520.58,1522.47, to determine
1523.04,1530.72, where i am on this so this would be the direction must be to be direction right if i turned a point on
1532.88,1536.84, a single degree surface just came to the great relic
1540.56,1542.27, now i got points
1543.02,1544.4, going in
1545.42,1556.1, reconsideration right so that i can describe what direction missus going on the surface that makes the next step if we go to the
1556.1,1560.21, she got a top that easy way to start
1561.26,1564.41, let's use a lips
1565.85,1567.5, let's try
1567.92,1569.3, the lips
1569.99,1573.26, from was actually picked to command for once
1573.41,1577.34, suspenders taxes is going to be here
1577.82,1580.07, second one is going to be about here
1580.55,1585.41, drag a shape out something like that and then we need to do one more
1585.59,1587.6, would be from front view
1587.96,1589.61, kind of capture
1590.99,1592.34, front he
1593.18,1594.77, the top 
1596.0,1605.72, let's turn the points on for this thing now you'll notice that i don't have very nice points for scalping if i bring this out you see this big kink in it
1605.75,1609.68, because the surface is not a high enough degree
1609.68,1617.48, in order to be able to actually do some sculpting so let's do that let's change that for a second we'll just run change degree
1617.75,1621.62, we're going to change it from a degree to service
1621.83,1627.8, ere the surface in bold directions now we have a much nicer lay out
1627.89,1630.89, in fact i can even rebuild it
1631.61,1634.94, get a few more points just so
1635.9,1641.72, so crazy for ninety is probably too much so let's go nine
1641.99,1649.01, let's go but you an odd number and the reason i want to use an odd numbers because it's going to give me a center by a center point
1649.22,1651.59, like down
1652.01,1653.18, that
1654.26,1655.46, that
1655.64,1657.38, so now i've got
1659.78,1662.21, a little bit better set up for stopping
1662.42,1663.38, i can
1663.95,1666.26, flattened end of this thing out
1666.26,1669.17, so that their nice and smooth
1672.77,1675.02, something like that
1677.42,1683.63, caesarius a flat most points out because it allows points are nice and flat straight line than it will be
1684.53,1686.15, let deal with
1686.36,1688.1, the center line
1688.73,1690.23, make him a little
1690.83,1692.21, she
1693.59,1695.51, the life that
1695.51,1697.82, in pollinate bit
1698.63,1710.42, starting to develop kind of a bug like she from the top tier he don't have to grab the whole row we can even just grab a few points we can just push in something like this and we can grabbed his leave too he came
1710.81,1712.61, a little pointer
1715.49,1718.79, and we do so like that
1719.48,1720.53, but
1720.68,1722.24, the center him
1722.27,1723.98, somewhere over the origin
1724.37,1725.63, okay
1725.63,1730.37, something like this a little bit of a cemetery is not a bad thing
1730.4,1731.99, looking beside the
1736.76,1737.96, instead of
1739.49,1742.85, moving these which can be kind of a gross
1744.35,1750.38, scale in one direction some in escape from here to
1750.47,1753.02, that see how that's a little softer
1755.3,1756.68, that
1757.49,1760.61, to pull these back a little bit just to
1760.82,1763.94, little bit funky a shape
1763.94,1766.52, gaspesie and see how we're doing
1768.68,1770.75, feelin kind of bug light
1770.93,1772.22, even
1773.21,1775.64, even want to pull
1775.88,1777.62, a single point
1779.24,1780.65, give him
1780.8,1789.71, a little bit more of a chin i don't know dragon flies have chance but mine does we've got that nail down
1789.92,1792.77, attach the head to the neck
1793.34,1795.83, i may be what i do
1796.55,1800.51, just give myself a little better opportunity
1803.21,1804.38, in
1805.1,1807.05, just these points
1809.93,1811.79, from the side view
1812.66,1814.28, a little
1815.36,1820.37, a place where that makes sense for that to attach right kind of something like that
1820.91,1822.98, just a little bit
1824.39,1828.8, my book i can do what i want is some one trim
1829.1,1830.57, make a hole
1830.66,1838.1, a little trick when it just drop pollie in a shape because i'm lazy and then i can just do
1838.4,1839.54, one
1839.78,1840.74, i
1842.15,1854.75, and then eleanore draw her venerate curve then do tramontano another trim and all that kind of stuff all right that little you little you shaped trimming you shaped curve for terminating like that is just my little cheap
1854.9,1857.69, so now we've done as we cut a hole here
1857.81,1859.4, we've cut a hole here
1859.7,1864.74, we exploded this so let's go ahead and join this back up
1865.16,1867.05, into a single police
1867.38,1871.31, use a blend service this is my favorite tool in all rhino
1871.49,1872.93, i
1873.53,1877.64, to changes and you notice that it just runs around there
1878.0,1879.38, around there
1879.98,1884.24, when i click it and if i had the previous can see what it's going to look like
1885.53,1886.94, i can adjust it
1888.14,1889.43, a time
1890.0,1891.47, get something that
1891.68,1893.54, what i wanted to do
1893.9,1902.84, i can change it from curiosity the case doesn't matter you know he could go either way perpetua be over kill but it is going to make a nice bland
1903.71,1905.03, for
1905.12,1907.25, i like that and then say
1909.38,1913.25, everything join it
1914.06,1915.77, and now when we share it
1916.76,1918.35, everything is connected
1919.49,1921.32, feeling kind of fog like
1921.68,1925.76, the bugs have next but like i said miss
1926.24,1928.25, i
1929.12,1930.8, we're going to take
1930.95,1931.97, the
1932.66,1933.71, here
1934.7,1936.17, lives here
1936.5,1944.78, i just do it from the center and i'm going to snap to the end of this so that i know i'm going to use the ship he
1944.99,1946.88, so that i know it's placed
1946.91,1948.83, on the side of the head
1950.72,1951.8, i'm going to
1952.25,1954.62, rebuild it
1954.95,1956.03, and
1956.39,1957.92, no use
1958.7,1960.92, she's a
1964.73,1966.92, that's going to give me some more points
1967.82,1972.23, in this case the point aren't really oriented very nicely for scalping
1972.35,1977.45, click on my gumboot ninety degrees have points
1977.6,1978.8, now
1979.16,1980.54, better set up
1981.14,1984.8, ping cause can just squish it a little bit erection
1988.52,1991.55, go front view
1991.85,1993.77, just use
1993.98,1999.59, it contengono that we we know are not going in or out in space where only to traveling
1999.83,2003.19, surface shipper
2006.04,2008.17, the front now
2008.23,2011.86, we call it up a little bit he's got gigantic eyes
2013.57,2016.39, painters
2017.2,2019.69, go to the top view
2020.38,2026.11, really like that orientation so i'm going to use the rotate command
2027.55,2029.62, because that works in the viewpoint
2029.92,2032.56, umballa associated with the object
2032.95,2037.12, effi to do that to its merit
2037.39,2039.13, and zero
2041.08,2042.73, you can do some addicts
2042.91,2044.74, as we had a history on
2045.55,2048.7, i need to do it it's going to happen to the other side now
2052.57,2053.83, go to my
2059.11,2070.66, now the book talks about captain the body which you could have done if he would just made a cap sir something of this thing we actually did that through point at any which i like better because it may explore a smooth and
2071.14,2074.2, you cap it you haven't a flat plane down here
2074.89,2076.57, you can do either way
2078.13,2080.35, that will skip the cap
2080.62,2082.75, of it since we did the other way
2082.81,2085.18, what make a little pincers
2085.72,2089.5, and in this case we're going to just do that with a bully an organ to take a cylinder
2089.89,2091.33, we're going to just
2092.17,2095.32, some about like that
2096.34,2099.49, about like that and let's like rotate it
2100.63,2103.48, it in
2104.56,2106.03, and
2111.49,2114.76, his editing it for feel at this point
2120.55,2122.41, once were happy with it
2122.5,2123.85, that is
2123.88,2125.92, through all the way around
2131.95,2142.75, do we that peace wonota little pincers are bunched on our way you could do that you could build different pieces of geometry to every want but like i said my love
2142.81,2154.27, but talk about the wings let's go back to the top you may be this is a good apgood opportunity to start organizing our file a little bit maybe we say
2154.27,2157.0, this is the body
2157.81,2159.76, he changed the object here
2160.84,2162.22, these
2165.43,2167.08, we change these here
2169.33,2173.83, since i model with a white background i don't like white layers
2174.34,2175.42, it
2176.77,2178.75, different color
2179.5,2187.9, in that way if i need to turn the body on and off like for the wings i need to be able to see the wings better so i can just shut that off in any time i want
2188.29,2199.36, i can work on the defaulter just so that i don't put something on a war that i don't want to have it on and in this case let's make a new layer has called us wings
2199.36,2204.22, then if i make that the current water now everything i make on that layer is going to go to that later
2204.34,2205.72, sensible right
2205.87,2208.51, to body and drawings
2210.31,2217.57, to trace this and i'm not going to machine gun points on your because i can always add metal later if i need to
2224.35,2226.36, i'm going to trace the other wing
2226.99,2230.08, overlap a little bit which is fine
2236.38,2238.72, a little shape and there
2239.05,2241.6, so these are a wing shapes
2241.81,2245.35, we can do with those there's a great tool
2245.62,2250.06, extreme closed plainer curve which is exactly what we have here
2250.57,2251.83, this
2252.1,2254.65, just expedite little bit
2255.88,2257.53, we then
2258.43,2265.39, something like that now watch this this is a cold trick if i pick this curve and then immediately right click
2266.11,2269.56, going to do the same thing over again if i write click again
2270.16,2272.23, going to do it at the same thickness
2272.35,2274.12, the men do that again
2275.38,2277.15, so pick the curve
2277.99,2282.58, then if i just i'm not even going to enter a thickness i can pull it way down here
2282.97,2285.01, i just write click
2285.13,2289.15, going to use the thickness of the last time if i wanted a thicker
2289.87,2291.7, have to click down here
2292.39,2294.13, i don't want that
2296.29,2297.73, going to do
2298.03,2304.18, sonorous a little bit of adjusting to beat so it do that let take this and pull it
2306.22,2309.82, because they don't want to touch they want to overlap
2310.84,2312.58, this guy
2313.03,2314.83, a little bit of it
2315.91,2317.59, they both
2318.04,2320.29, up a little bit
2320.95,2324.07, we're going to want our body back so that we can position that now
2326.35,2331.48, the typically come out of like appear on the back so i
2334.78,2336.79, i like that
2337.33,2338.83, yes
2339.31,2343.09, this plan i conna little square on the gun all
2343.54,2345.13, place that
2345.73,2346.84, then
2347.35,2349.66, even going to
2351.67,2353.53, go to the top view
2358.6,2362.05, been rotate this one back a little bit just so 
2363.88,2365.02, i
2366.07,2368.95, less stiff and canal
2370.57,2371.5, right
2372.31,2375.49, should be able to see a little bit of air through an they shouldn't be touching
2376.06,2380.95, and then let's just run the merman
2383.38,2392.8, we got wings so the cool thing about building those antler is everything that we built on that wings layer is now still on that wing are
2394.27,2395.14, right
2397.21,2407.47, so the legs kind of a cool trick and let's shut the wings off now there in the way i can use apolline just a straight pointsmen
2407.65,2409.39, to trace them
2410.2,2411.64, to the
2413.14,2414.67, very quickly
2420.58,2425.53, they're not the right shape right they're just flat because i just drew them so these curves
2425.89,2434.59, flat they're not they're not following the shape that i want them to follow so if i go to my perspective view and i turn on
2434.83,2436.63, the point
2438.55,2442.39, these points my constant pulling them
2443.62,2451.33, into a little bit more but tactical shape
2452.65,2454.9, i hear something cool to
2455.71,2457.18, is that
2457.48,2460.75, to use the pipe command to do this
2461.8,2463.18, to make the legs
2463.9,2469.27, the pipe command is historically enabled so i could even
2470.44,2472.75, take always in line up
2473.08,2478.78, inertia and then just pull him down that way we know he's all he's going to be sitting on the ground
2479.2,2480.73, the same spot
2481.48,2485.44, and so did toinette
2485.8,2487.66, and
2488.68,2491.92, just adjusting these points just by feel
2492.07,2500.74, this point i've kind of abandoned my reference because the legs and the top being a ladies on the side you don't match so now i'm i'm often
2501.1,2503.26, artistic interpretation and
2504.52,2511.03, was it to the pipe and let make let's give him a little bit of a shoulder
2511.06,2512.26, then
2512.65,2516.34, give him just a little tippy toe down here at the end
2519.4,2520.63, watch this
2520.9,2527.44, pipe command being historically and ambled if i go back and grab the original points of the curve
2527.65,2529.39, over
2530.38,2531.64, what
2537.01,2538.18, say
2539.62,2542.62, to update or interesting
2544.12,2546.67, like it's got its limits as to what it will
2546.73,2548.47, to do that
2549.01,2552.61, be able to do some little adjustments as long as
2553.18,2557.74, can rebuild itself so i can adjust that a little bit out the original curve
2558.13,2562.03, too big and it can't make the transition between the two then
2563.53,2566.08, so still having a problem with that
2567.61,2572.77, it's fine what obscure
2581.23,2582.91, so let
2583.12,2584.44, this
2585.64,2588.07, this guy
2591.52,2593.68, extract this surface
2594.4,2595.84, locked
2595.9,2597.19, between here
2601.09,2602.41, he
2603.4,2606.07, tell me i can't do it well
2607.15,2609.46, all sorts of different ways to get around
2610.21,2612.31, issues that show up
2615.16,2621.4, basically the reason that happened is because i was just asking for two big of a transition from one end to the other
2621.79,2625.6, the radius of that object could turn that corner
2627.64,2629.8, is fine we just forced it to
2633.31,2634.87, that unworked
2640.27,2642.61, the ripe
2642.88,2644.47, mirror
2644.59,2646.45, around zero
2650.65,2652.09, wings back
2655.06,2662.17, usually dragon flies don't rest with their wings flat like that they usually rest
2664.96,2667.09, their wings kind of more
2667.12,2671.23, so let's do that history of dated the other ones
2676.96,2682.0, secure when i discharged the torture later
2684.13,2687.94, then since we have our images on planes we can turn them off
2689.38,2691.33, our ground plan on
2692.05,2694.33, swimming
2694.96,2696.52, said i upon
2696.79,2698.08, the
2705.13,2706.72, we've got our
2707.17,2711.31, got our but what's makin a little more interesting working what's got to
2712.21,2714.07, bring up some materials
2717.73,2718.75, let
2719.35,2721.18, materials
2722.05,2723.82, basic material
2724.57,2726.37, make him
2726.97,2728.56, greenish
2730.12,2732.1, i drag this to that
2734.71,2738.13, t click and duplicate
2740.86,2743.35, give him some kind of pinkish eyes
2750.64,2752.89, i make those real shiny
