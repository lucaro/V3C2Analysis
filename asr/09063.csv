132.42,143.01, the idea of paradox how these two separate things our existing and you think they contradict but how can they both be true if they contradict them so that the song is almost

553.23,555.72, pretty much brain washing myself

829.02,832.44, a small town right on a one person
832.68,835.92, a pretty weird and at first i did not like it at all
836.25,859.65, so i graspan movie theater and a laser tag plays and all those sorts of things and i am there is nothing here but that's why i started getting really into stating how yore
