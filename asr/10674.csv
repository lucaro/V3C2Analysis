183.6,185.58, we live in a culture
185.97,190.38, everyone is demanding more and more freedom
190.68,194.43, to do whatever they want to do

251.82,255.39, nothing that we can do in ourselves
256.08,257.67, do anything about it
258.45,261.78, the more that we insist on our own freedom
262.41,266.64, the more that we insist on doing things our own way
266.73,269.46, more entangled we become
269.73,272.4, our diction to selfishness
274.8,277.14, jesus shows us a way out
277.68,280.56, john chapter eight verse

420.81,422.07, she

425.31,427.32, your freedom
427.56,432.03, i mean that you can live your life however you choose to live it
432.09,434.28, makes it very clear
434.31,436.2, that is not
438.21,440.55, word flesh here
441.18,444.81, first to our sin nature
445.32,447.63, natural desire
448.08,450.66, to do the wrong
452.16,459.69, doesn't make sense that jesus would set us free so that he could sin he sets us free
460.2,462.18, be free from
462.42,463.32, said
464.01,465.9, reminding us
466.17,472.59, we were not set free to do whatever we choose to do
473.43,475.71, he lived his life
475.98,480.48, an example for us to follow as an example for how
480.51,483.93, we should live and romans chapter fifteen
484.11,485.55, first three
486.03,487.92, even christ
488.01,490.92, please himself
491.28,492.78, the first time
493.23,497.58, we can be free to do what god wants us to do
497.97,500.91, as we love him
501.42,504.69, this is how god wants us to express
504.72,505.95, freedom
506.04,507.57, she
508.02,510.42, my brothers and sisters
510.45,512.43, called to be free
513.12,518.13, do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh rather instead
518.49,520.59, serve one another
523.8,526.41, jesus told us how to serve
526.41,531.87, another humbly and love when the disciples were arguing among themselves about who
531.9,535.02, the greatest remember that story
535.32,537.54, the chapter twenty two
538.59,540.42, you are not like that
541.11,545.07, instead the greatest among you should be like the youngest
545.64,547.65, the one who rules
547.83,550.08, the one who serves
550.77,552.3, who is greater
552.75,554.88, one who is at the table
555.09,557.01, the one who serves
557.43,560.04, not the one who is at the table
560.88,562.95, i am among you
563.22,564.72, one
566.97,569.19, he took on himself
569.46,571.95, attitude of a servant
572.16,573.78, as a christian
574.02,576.33, we are to have the attitude
576.57,577.74, jesus
578.37,580.38, in chapter two
582.45,585.0, your relationships with one another
585.18,588.51, the same mind set as christ jesus
589.02,597.9, being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be used to his own advantage
598.2,603.48, rather he made himself nothing but taking the very nature of a servant
603.72,606.18, being made in human
607.74,609.06, a christian
609.45,613.8, a follower of christ and a growing relationship with him
614.01,618.09, we should be developing the heart of christ
618.48,620.79, the heart of christ
620.97,622.47, the heart
622.8,624.06, a servant
624.75,628.56, freedom and christ is not a licence to sin
629.07,630.69, opportunity
634.98,637.95, the entire law is fulfilled
638.01,640.47, keeping this one command
640.95,642.93, love your neighbor
643.29,644.7, yourself
645.45,648.84, freedom to love is so amazing
648.99,651.39, so powerful
651.48,655.41, every law that has ever been given
655.59,659.94, filled by loving your neighbor as yourself
661.08,664.14, we truly love people
664.47,669.3, all we love jesus we will not lie
669.9,672.36, we will not still
672.75,675.09, we will not kill
675.21,678.15, we will not commit adultery
678.3,680.22, we will not
681.48,683.4, love is in our heart
683.52,687.75, every law is fulfilled
688.77,690.54, we see in verse
692.19,694.68, love is not always in our heart
695.79,698.22, you buy and devour each other
698.85,702.12, watch out or you will be destroyed
702.3,707.19, each other the illustration here is like a bunch of wild animals
707.34,709.44, attacking each other
710.19,714.99, no matter how many religious laws and religious rules we have
715.23,719.52, spiritual unity is not something that can be legislated
719.58,721.05, in force
721.8,725.52, unless the holy spirit fills our heart with love
725.79,727.77, we will not have
729.96,731.16, ness
731.55,732.9, petition
733.53,735.27, for
735.39,738.54, carrying our churches apart
739.53,742.41, where the spirit of the lord is
742.98,745.08, there will be
749.07,750.51, so i say
750.84,752.91, walk by the spirit
753.48,756.66, you will not gratify the desires
756.75,758.07, the flesh
758.58,759.99, grace
760.05,761.4, through
761.52,763.74, a price set us free
764.34,768.42, then we begin to understand who jesus is
768.78,774.06, all that he has done for us and when we do that we can help but as
774.3,776.85, how can i serve him
778.05,785.85, a better live for him and then that replaces or desire to live for ourself
786.15,790.38, motivate us to be led by the holy spirit
790.5,795.39, motivate us to obey the law of love
798.39,800.4, the flesh desires
800.46,802.89, contrary to the spirit
803.49,806.79, and the spirit what is contrary to the flesh
807.45,809.94, in conflict with each other
810.33,814.2, that you are not to do whatever you want
814.74,816.72, in nature
817.17,820.98, desires of the flesh are at war
821.01,822.36, the spirit
823.05,828.15, that is why as a christian weekend not trust our feelings
828.99,831.36, we are led by the spirit
831.48,834.03, we will live by the spirit
834.36,837.18, we are led by our signature
837.36,843.84, we will live by our senator there is a constant conflict
844.05,846.09, in the two
846.72,849.21, this very real conflict
849.33,854.28, paul talked about and romans chapter seven or fifteen
855.36,858.51, i do not understand what i do
859.59,861.72, what i want to do
862.26,864.06, i do not do
865.08,866.73, what i hate
867.36,868.56, i do
869.85,872.55, do not do the good i want to do
873.39,876.3, the evil i do not want to do
876.48,877.56, this
877.56,879.3, i keep on
879.36,880.44, doing
881.49,884.64, is the apostle paul talking
885.09,886.26, perhaps
886.32,889.26, the most godly devoted
889.62,892.56, dedicated christians who ever lived
892.95,894.84, that his experience
894.9,896.85, while with ours
897.12,898.38, a different
899.13,900.87, so was the answer
904.2,906.33, a few are led by the spirit
907.38,909.57, not under the law
910.05,911.31, answer
911.34,913.5, not the law
914.07,919.65, all of the laws rules and regulations in the world can not defeat
920.04,921.9, sinful nature
923.04,928.68, the answer is not our will power or our determination no matter how hard
928.74,931.98, try not to do the wrong thing
933.24,934.41, the answer
934.77,936.27, to be led
936.69,937.89, the spirit
938.91,941.4, we surrender control
941.58,944.01, our life to the holy spirit
944.4,948.51, to to walk in the spirit day by day
948.87,954.78, step by step he will move us forward in the christian life
954.84,957.12, where we are today
957.21,960.24, were god wants us to be
960.9,970.14, it is the spirit who leads us it is our responsibility to walk in the spirit but in his strength
970.71,971.97, through
972.15,973.41, power
974.31,976.92, near the end of this chapter
977.82,979.74, shows us the difference
980.07,983.79, between the works of our senator the works
983.97,986.4, the flesh and the fruit
986.91,988.11, the spirit
988.68,991.59, it gives us a list of some of the works
991.71,994.41, the iris a nasty list
995.52,998.37, and first nineteen
999.6,1001.88, of the flesh are obvious
1002.72,1004.46, sexual and morality
1005.18,1006.44, purity
1006.86,1008.63, adultery
1009.5,1012.68, first three have to do with sexual sin
1013.49,1016.31, sexual morality is set between
1016.55,1018.5, married people
1020.15,1025.82, and plan for sex is six between a married couple a man and a woman for life
1027.26,1028.46, purity
1028.79,1031.97, unnatural sexual relations
1033.05,1034.34, try
1034.58,1036.71, uncontrolled
1036.89,1038.15, it
1041.39,1044.3, do try and witchcraft
1044.75,1047.84, these two words referred to
1047.84,1049.04, religion
1049.4,1053.42, or is anything that we try to substitute for god
1055.85,1057.56, a counterfeit
1057.74,1059.0, the spirit
1060.59,1064.91, then in verse and twenty one we see things
1065.15,1069.62, the sin nature that have the ability to destroy
1069.74,1071.33, relationships
1076.31,1077.54, discord
1078.11,1079.34, jealousy
1080.24,1081.8, of rage
1082.4,1084.2, selfish ambition
1084.71,1086.06, sentence
1086.6,1087.95, actions
1088.52,1089.63, in
1091.73,1094.25, intense dislike
1094.52,1096.29, a hostile attitude
1097.31,1098.63, discord
1099.23,1103.34, taking fights and being argumentative
1105.44,1106.64, jealousy
1107.21,1109.28, resentment against
1109.49,1111.56, one success
1113.45,1114.92, of rage
1115.25,1118.61, uncontrolled burst of anger
1119.96,1122.09, selfish ambition
1122.69,1124.64, my first
1127.46,1128.63, sessions
1129.35,1130.88, the visions
1130.91,1132.2, between people
1133.58,1134.84, on
1135.17,1137.72, groups that war with each other
1140.78,1143.36, wanting what others
1145.46,1148.4, then two words in verse 
1148.76,1152.99, the scribe a senator completely out of control
1153.5,1154.82, drunken this
1155.39,1156.56, the
1157.43,1158.51, the 
1161.33,1162.74, warn you
1163.16,1164.9, i did before
1165.59,1168.11, those who live like this
1168.8,1170.81, will not inherit
1171.14,1172.76, kingdom of god
1173.21,1176.45, is not talking here about the act of sin
1177.02,1179.24, talking about the habit
1180.89,1183.59, a big difference between a lapse
1183.71,1189.92, judgment and then repenting of your sin and not doing it again thank god for grace
1190.79,1193.73, we would all be hopeless
1194.93,1198.92, people who continually live like this
1199.46,1201.44, will not inherit
1201.92,1203.15, kingdom
1205.49,1212.03, a couple of interesting things to notice about this list of the works of the flesh
1212.36,1215.36, god does not make the distinction
1215.39,1218.54, the sins like we do
1219.44,1221.66, the benefit of
1221.9,1224.84, church people hypocrites today
1225.29,1227.87, god puts jealousy
1228.47,1230.06, ambition
1230.42,1231.95, in the
1232.4,1236.0, right there with the worst of the sexual sins
1237.47,1240.26, notice that as you look at this list
1240.83,1243.53, we are usually much better
1244.13,1247.43, seeing some one else's simple nature
1248.3,1251.63, instead of billing with our own
1253.46,1255.74, it's not enough for a christian
1256.46,1260.99, in a growing relationship with jesus to be free of evil
1261.35,1263.72, in our life that's not enough
1264.53,1266.96, growing relationship with jesus
1267.23,1269.54, should also produce
1270.02,1271.1, it

1352.16,1354.08, spiritual growth
1355.22,1357.08, like the growth of fruit
1357.56,1360.53, happens gradually over time
