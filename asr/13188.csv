6.15,10.86, what i would like us to do i imagine for a moment that in a battle shop
11.46,15.33, bottle shot perusing the red wine and the show
15.54,22.56, cook yourself or your bed to cook antistius meal for the evening perhaps it's a red man you need just the right bed wine
24.69,31.02, on the shelves two quite similar balls of red repayment to some style
31.17,32.46, as
32.46,42.3, it brands at athos between products when they quite similar and while your pondering his choice as to imagine that if in the background
42.42,45.3, music started wafting away
46.02,53.01, she sees started wasting away in the background of perhaps is more strongly leaped with
53.01,54.78, one of the brands and the other
55.02,58.5, the music would have actually affect your decision
58.77,61.8, affected your decision would you actually be aware
61.83,74.04, i have that effect with the reason of the priming you with this thought is a group of research is explored this various or a ten years ago and so they set up a shelf in a real battle shop
75.09,90.51, one on the shelf to it almost a denial bottles of red wine but one was branded in the very germ and wire had a german labradorman manufacture whereas the other was french so have a french hagerman wine otherwise identical
90.57,104.88, it was over two weeks each alternate night they played music in the background of his bottle shop that was either prototypal french or on the other day productivity german
104.94,115.8, i did and then if i shock about one of those bolts of wine at the check at that were as if they would completely interview about while i bought the wine
116.19,119.37, the results of astraea they found
119.55,121.68, when french music was played
121.92,133.47, nineteen three to one and vosterman music was played three to one so staggering effect of this music on the decision now that
133.53,140.22, interesting but what's more interesting as at the people's reactions to those decisions and what was found
141.45,152.01, as a people that were interviewed only one of them say spontaneously he i think may be the music had an impact on my decision and even more staggering
152.16,175.23, six percent of people specifically set no the music did not influence my decision so that staggered got a three to one effect of the music but a sixpence of people saying now it did not fit moleson where's the gap helena possibly be well this is one of many insights that we are just starting to realize how calliere connected with
175.47,181.17, the reasons that we might decisions in a decision mainprice so if we ask
181.35,188.91, how well can we report the influences on her decisions probably the best answer is will not actually very well at all
188.97,191.28, let me give you another example
191.43,193.29, another study
193.71,202.71, explored with our we could be influenced in a decisions by things that we had no knowledge of saying whatsoever and what this study it was how people
202.74,204.45, france
204.48,210.9, write at hollister institute and then they ran her up they would be prepared to pay
211.02,226.5, this particular orange juice what these individuals didn't know was before they made the decision that were actually flashed a facial expression they saw those neutral faces on screen but what directly presented win was a momentary
226.92,228.99, infiltration
231.81,261.18, now it was actually a lot faster than that now you could see that but the face expression changed so quickly that there were subliminal you could put not possibly know that you'd been presented with them so they are the faces that people actually saw and he is hereafter their writings of the orange this crabshaw's their willingness to pay and the end of the story is that flashman face before you make it a cusin people that were thirsty would prepare to pay three times as much
261.24,276.21, the range as they didn't know that saying that they had no wanness whatso we were resemblance but drastically affected their decision so once again was saying here that even women are whereof any influences on elections we can be based in some way or another
276.51,313.65, my colleagues and a university of milman of explored at another angle on this what we've done is explored the extent that brand brand logos actually influence her decisions and what we was a similar thing we flashed brandagoras people before they made choice the choice we gave them was whether they would like a reward right now would you like twenty dollars right now or would you be prepared to wait ten days and receive more money later on and what we found is that when flashed a look sublimely said they didn't know that say it for a very powerful brand they became more impulsive
313.65,319.38, i wanted money now more than if we'd flesh them something that was in a brand logo
319.86,322.68, we can see these underlying
322.86,326.49, sub conscious decision magilene at work here
326.7,355.71, we also recorded brian imagine responses while people made those choices and we saw areas in the branding with process in the rereward value of a stimulus faring when presented with the applegates all points to a couple of implications of this labradorians are influenced by rooftrees besides our conscious rational thought and the extent that we can talk about these influences is extremely limited
355.74,362.52, very difficult for us to and not sit why we make decisions and actually be accurate about it
364.44,386.25, these kinds of thoughts echoed barrent research and the nuisances and almost twenty years ago now a very influential book by clinical naselton amasis looked achaea showed that certain areas of brain damage limit people's ability to add an emotional time the decisions
386.34,405.3, and when you don't demotions to you decisions people make bad bad decisions we once for that cold rational thinking is the best way to make a decision were actually a piece to be the other way around we actually need emotions to make good decisions and when we lose that ability retentive
406.56,414.33, so we do he sentence on emerson's come from well that ten years worth of near a side researches been showing
414.75,430.83, we can track to a certain extent this decision like the influences in certain areas of the bright one example is here this is a study from two thousand and seven and brininstool presented people with
430.95,451.35, educate could buy guanabara of money and then he showed them while their brains were being scared product they could buy and then he showed them how much it would cost them and the people made a decision about whether they would like to buy or not and what he found long story short is that when people chose one of those products
451.59,455.79, in the brick without processing of rewards
455.88,456.9, i
457.05,463.83, and these areas appeared to be prevalent in much of our decision marital botheration making
463.83,468.0, very difficult areas for us to be aware of that influence occurring
470.07,505.44, so what do we do with this well of course market researches a fascinated by this that for a hundred years may not call people questions about while riley something do you like this product do you like the advertisement and of course a verbal responses don't provide accurate information or there's something missing so this has been that the background to why techniques that draw on physiological measures and neurosis by techniques have become of interest to marketing research organizations and there's two broad streams of research happen
505.47,520.47, research companies are using these body signalises to get a better group on the white people respond to stimulate and academics as well since as myself a very interested in using these tools to better understand how we make decisions
520.62,532.56, so that brings us to the world innerarity he's a vaticination is a something that i take my students there is no one correct definition of what your marketing is as a very young field
532.56,546.39, still in some one of state of flux so the division i teach my students is near a marking as the use of theory and tools from the competitors winford marketing activities and marketing fear
546.99,560.94, a more hathawi do it we need to understand thinking processes that people use to make decisions within use tools from the nearer sciences or psychophysiology as it's called
561.3,578.94, measurements of the body that reflect thinking and that we apply to marking practice or theory or distinto that very briefly thinking process as when they to understand how people take information in from the world have i learned from it what they do with it and then have a use that information to make decisions
579.0,586.17, there are existing theories from cotelo for example that we can draw on us to explore these issues
586.8,610.59, we cause of tools to near market is used whilere paper and two thousand ten published in harvard review psychiatry and they found sixty incompris on the internet using near a marking techniques five of those companies used if in orificial magnetic resonance magistrate most of the companies were using a technique called
611.19,616.41, a shine is using the collect aesels office scalp as we speak
616.83,631.32, so very briefly if him or functional magnetic reason it imagine it a medical technique and essentially explores blood flow in the bridnorth ough the body and the logic of using this is the wind you think
631.62,640.29, in something like a muscle it uses energy it needs more blood flow and this device extracts where their blood flow goes to
640.29,644.88, it is a hardy rebecca can look declaring the bride with a couple of millimeter
644.88,647.07, precision
647.58,651.36, another technique and this is probably the most common use
651.42,654.45, picking up electrical signals in the bride
654.63,657.33, groups of neurones fire
657.69,663.69, different this particular technique as it's picking up activity on the scalp rather than do inside the brim
663.72,672.48, very good at picking up very fast chinese an activity so near a moccasin using this for example for advertising copy testing
672.54,675.75, men by moment changes in a advertisement
676.53,699.06, and fanny some of the other tools of a being used pick up other kinds of seals from the body at the top image is facial electrograph which is picking up where the people are smiling or frowning and the reason that useful as sometimes we have microphones in response to an air or a product and this technology can expect that up
699.09,701.19, i tracking in the middle
701.58,705.66, where people are actually looking with a focusing their attention
705.81,712.41, and tracking in conjunction with it say so you know where someone's looking and what's going on
712.47,727.47, at the same time and the bottom image there susskind conduct and response picking up a measure from the hand of the skin the reflect how aroused somebody is so various near a marinoni are combining
727.92,731.4, stations of these tests to pick up signals
731.64,734.79, and to reflect her people think
734.79,736.14, to
736.14,739.56, to an idea or a movie or advertisement
739.68,743.31, and that's the applaud pattaquasset so what's being done with it
743.46,746.52, product testing is one application
747.09,755.13, the later on not markets and so much interested in manipulating people as they are in understanding what people value
755.73,761.19, people want that's really what the core of makersee about tunasan what people want
761.91,765.12, these tools are very good for picking up seals that reflect
765.15,767.79, all driven towards something
767.82,780.69, and then that could be built into production there was a lot of advertising copy testing going on using these talks to get a better grip on second by second changes in people's responses to advertisement
780.96,783.15, with a redecorating with people
783.24,784.53, and
784.62,789.72, i such myself using those tools to the better understand how people make decisions
789.96,813.18, so now i was initiated very brief introduction to think illiteracy knowledge ment to my my pears at that no university and that it remenyi
