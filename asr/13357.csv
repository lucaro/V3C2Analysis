0.06,28.26, this year as to acting up with the texas conference to do a one million comission trip we are reminded as deciders why we do these kinds of faiths one million glow one million glow is it possible to put over one million pieces of literature into an entire place to cover the place with truth illiterature
28.35,65.82, it is in fact i've been experiencing a here in one million glove houston texas and from the beginning it was the ship took off rather quickly in fact the missionaries weren't supposed to gather on until the twenty first but when we walked into the facility there was already a couple waiting to join us early these missionary coming early because they wanted to partake of the mission that was at hand were living in interesting times and it is our christian duty to be able to share the truth that you and i know we live in a dark world
65.91,78.18, we live in a dark place in its our duty to shed light upon this upon this area that you may be thinking on willingly can i go do something like that
78.36,86.34, we had youngsters as young as and even a year old who was here and we had older people as long joined us
86.85,90.3, something that anyone and everyone should do
90.57,93.63, we have one million glow mission trips coming up
94.56,97.65, in the united states and of the united states
98.16,104.55, courage to visit the website in to see where it was one million glow a comparative in
104.79,109.5, the mason trips at a beautiful thing to see
110.01,116.22, the community being reached on such a large scale the interest that i have that
116.22,122.49, although a largely to about is when people do eileen church were singing
123.12,173.22, bless the community but is actually a bigger blessing for them even the bible itself says is more blessed to give than to receive all it also mentioned another places that the best medicine you can give the church is not sermonizing then but actually planning work for them is as gito help young people learn what it is to embrace a call to radical evangelism an just an entire life of missionary service one of the mission that we hope and pray that all young people will live by is that they just know how to be a christian ambassador wherever they go one million glow from the beginning it was awesome to see people from all different types of walks of life all different upbringing and backgrounds and from across the united states coming together for one purpose
173.61,175.74, the unity that was felt
175.77,222.03, an explainable i guess that's what naturally happens when everybody has the same mist and that is to serve jesus to literature it has been an experience of a lifetime are day to day routine goes from working together doing tore together cleaning preparing for the day eating together and then hitting the field together we were split up into groups of six missionaries with the leader in a minivan head out to the street we were blanket neighborhood shopping centres everything that we could possibly glow we lodge this literature has opened the eyes of many and we want the eyes of houston texas to be opened as well just like our eyes were open when we hurt when we first heard the truth
222.54,234.75, comes up to me and asks me half way through the mission trip she says how can i do something like this back home but i began to tell her and explained to her and then i asked her just casually i say well were you from
235.59,237.75, he said i'm from alaska
238.95,248.31, i thought to myself wait a minute i'm basically a hundred percent confident that we haven't had the chance to take this up to alaska and an intentional way
248.4,250.83, and this lady
250.89,258.84, it upon her heart to do something in alaska and as a result of that not only are people going to be reached in alaska but
258.84,262.44, like all the missionaries that were motivated in inspired
262.47,264.45, with this experience
264.66,268.86, her church members are in turn an i be motivated and inspired
269.07,283.83, it was awesome to see the missionaries they would seem songs and hymns as they were working there wasn't a typical work place and reminded me of jesus in the bizarre bage's work we read that he is to actually seeing him as he worked in the carpenter's shop
284.22,288.96, a unity amongst the missionaries there are many who don't know the truth
289.5,321.96, and we had a bit pathlike be the gift of joy that talked about righteous as by faith we had pamphlets on on we go to church on saturday that talked about on your in god's fourth commandments we had tracks on when freedom dies that actually talked about revelation thirteen and and the thing to expect in the near future so the one million glowed on disrepect one million people that will be one to get to the kingdom we don't know how many people are going to take that bill and pass it on or they're going to take that glow and set it down somewhere because they're done with it
322.26,324.36, take that long even throw it away
324.9,327.57, he many times and someone else is going to find that
328.08,330.9, trams going to find an he's goin to read it he's going to pass it 
330.93,334.14, to find his way its way around his circle
334.71,339.48, numberless people are going to be saved as a result of one tract we're not just reaching one million people
339.63,342.21, no idea of the amount of people that were reaching
342.24,372.51, he detailed
373.08,399.27, the memorable case teamed up with the texas conference we were so grateful for the collaboration that we had and knowing that not only did we re urge of giving all the way the literature out but the larger goal of seeing christian young people reinspired and recommitted to give their entire lives to god in service
