10.47,45.39, you know we've gotten away from having the middle of that bothersome we all have supermarkets and were trying to get in a way from this bringeth neighborhood with her out fast so we get our animals directly from small family farms everything is naturally raised for montreal relegates the unopposed to welby animals all others sustainable way to do it and we actually cut up animals here in the parts are all of our products is one of from nowhither two hours away an it's all direct from the far
45.75,52.23, you know when i like when i think how i lastnamed bring he raised him he killed him he delivers
56.58,57.24, he
58.41,62.34, on over the product that i bring in because i'm feeling directly with my former
62.55,67.44, somebody who's going to contact somebody who's going to put together by
68.73,92.25, to the farmers who raise thine and when i get a big today it was still runaround that there is penitence to be able to to know for certain that the money that my customers gave me i turned round like a directed the farmer that are not a factory farm animal or whether its local or whether it was you know truckin from satyrus country you know these are all things that matter not and it seems to matter what marcus

93.84,97.14, he
97.77,103.62, comes to sorting your animals the way that the grass pretty crucial if i'm just going to
103.92,120.3, from a factory farm where you know nerado the animals are treated and how well kind of life they lived on what the quality of what they ate then there's no real point in the doing is the end another system so that they can raise products faster
120.45,133.59, reconsidered him maybe seven a factory house probably levantine all heard the stories by now as they may they feed him grain that that unlike
133.68,141.15, i'm troubled digestion and they have given them medication to help them digest all the stuff and recover their systems from
141.39,159.3, not being able to handle it and you know i want genial that are thinking that really fast and he lived many years probably a little less and you wind up with the mechanical supermarket what if we compare our or beaming
159.57,165.15, sort of thing cellared or even our red now that from
165.96,196.02, of walking around reading on passers the whole point is that you know these animals were raised without more monotheistic say you know like our own there are horses that they around the pastor and as my farmer seems of the time making sure they've got villages grain that that's what they do they live you know maybe three or half year which is real really long time for a far manley know where the stuff is coming from and it's coming from the right place but then the end result is that a higher quality of better tasting product
198.21,416.31, the benefit of about being a small beershop like this is that somebody comes in and i can see just a cut that peter better for what they're doing or less expensive or disputative to what they're used to allow people to learn that there's more to a countenance revindicate cotelette canetons a port tenderloins and you'll get a box with individually rapporte we get a whole pig if i get three pigs and i get six tenderer sacrificing having all the popular cut in in abundance in an expanse for having entire animal before with all the bones mansoor sold to people we see marrowbones it really like rosinante we suppose will for their dogs must in a methodist of little scrap it's one of getting ground or made into things like like with leafage our own honor rolled will you saucestained inornate do all kinds of stuff when with all the fissionables tuscaloosa to see and not of moroseness of what people are seeing himself in their families i think it's possible to do it on a large scale but i think approaching it that way is the wrong initiates to be happening and what need to happen is for for choice this to start with so we can get back to having a withersoever neighborhood had thesmopolis in cities all over the country bottiglie chicago and small little polypes that are sorting onprotected offering up alternatives to the expensive cuts that were used singulare and gives people more often on how to eat well and how to eat well affordable but it can be done by a major corporation because that's how the whole problem start you know and it started happened to shorty good handful with her sobs and broken in the happifying up a cattle and morland are all over hamesucken horsefoot there's a loose one of the place that's going to be opening up soon notepaper people start openhearted of you know a large scale approach to people eating this kind of product is to do it you know roninhohonti
