156.03,160.89, to just make a funny story and
161.16,166.32, you know it was pilasters idea and when he told me about it i just knew that it was going to work

918.69,922.08, well we consider doing sequels
922.29,929.1, something that has already come up either a sequel or spin off series i think we want to wait to see
929.43,938.34, how well this one does and what parts people like and what part they don't i think that might help tailor any future efforts on our part to
938.46,944.52, to create something that follows this little lines that were creating
954.72,967.26, after say i really enjoyed working with everybody on pa everybody really pulled through into a great job phenomenal actors they knew their lines when he got to the sets
968.28,970.08, i was a fair amount of
970.14,972.36, a living going on which
972.42,976.53, though work well because it was a documentary and everybody was supposed to sound natural
976.74,984.93, the laws probably one of the best things about this film is that everybody just sounds so natural in it and really made it work because if they had hamdi
985.2,988.05, i don't think it would have worked nearly as well
988.26,993.72, everybody plays it straight and there are some really ridiculous situations we presented them with
994.05,999.45, i have to say as far as a production department i can't say enough good things about them
999.51,1008.93, mister did the designs in application for the pepper one spray which was in fact even water bottles which we modified to spray a stream

1029.09,1031.82, those came out fantastic i think they're really work
1032.15,1034.91, and then she also did the
1035.21,1039.02, designed for the pizza logo itself which appears on the front of a share
1041.0,1048.56, got to give a special shut out to amante cheek who actually applied the patches to
