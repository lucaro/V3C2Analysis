4.41,11.31, hello welcome to the balanced body poca i'm lindy royer physical therapist
11.43,17.76, one of parasites and physical therapy in lantry colorado and balanced body faculty member
18.09,20.19, day with my friend christ
20.22,21.63, going to help us
21.96,29.13, at some of the structures that influence the knee particularly when we're going through rebellion program of a new patient
30.06,36.27, to look in a couple of exercises at the difference between gastronomes complex
36.48,42.99, struck obviously as a muscle that inserts above the knee so has direct influence over the knee joint
43.14,45.39, however influences
45.39,110.25, particularly with repulsion and influences or lower extremity through the ankle so we're going to look at two different exercises that can tagetes two different muscles to help us so it out a little better which muscle may or may not be more dominant in a patient so crystalline do a single leg press here i'm going to help christino position by pressing the pedal down so we have just one spring here so that we can smoothly transition from one exercise to the other and you'll see in a moment that one spring is going to be plenty for the exercises that were doing so i like to start with the pedal down because it's much more easy for our patience and clients to get into balance polisson than if we start in more hippolita's going to be a lot more challenging for her to maintain policemen with the pedal in this position because it is an increase in cilicios we're in a studiosi and then christison to place her hands just lightly on
110.34,126.48, and now we want to have light balance as little as possible actually rather than having a death grip on the handles because then clearly were not going to be challenging balance stability if our patience are relying solely on upward street i mean to take my foot off the petal now
126.9,132.45, and christ is negotiating her limit were looking for balance support
132.51,144.93, both extremities for right now understanding that i left leg is going to be moving so studying in this position christ's going to ground herself through her right leg she's on the ball of her left foot
145.5,149.64, you start to inhale an you allow the pedal to float up
149.94,156.06, no let her explore range of motion of hippolito on the left side
157.05,167.43, looking to see is she able to maintain stability through the right side if were not able to do this than we want obviously proceed on to the next phase of the exercise
168.57,171.63, can you bring the leg up about half way
171.81,186.66, as for seaman tain a position with her left leg where she's about half way between pedal the way down and all the way the top of the spring and now take another breath in a more christ's going to be doing is floating the right heel up
186.72,228.78, she's coming up on to the ball of the foot as you in how well looking for control as she lowers her left or right foot down on to the floor he left fort is maintaining its position this is quite challenging as is actually a really great care exercise because his a lot that has to be organized through the core in order to maintain this what i'm looking at here and i really want to look at her from a variety of angles and positions is she able to boonton tritely and eccentrically controlled his position and is she also able to maintain a line through the ball of the foot so looking at foot mechanics and omens and lower extremity mechanics
228.99,239.4, connected to obviously a nice stable too and well organized upper extremity as presages more comfortable with this and before she fatigues
239.76,243.36, i'd like her to see if she can take her hands off
243.93,262.86, handles and see if you can do just what nor two of these now you notice as we start to challenge the balance in stability even more she's probably going to have a little bit less range of motion through the foot in the ankle which is totally fine so this is a really great challenge were really looking at how the gastric influences
262.89,269.49, the lower chain burialplace your hands back on the handles and let the pecome up
270.39,283.95, now we're going to continue we're going to be working now on the left leg and she done so much great work this is actually an excellent transition when i come into an achilles stretch on the left leg to christian a lower her hands down on to
283.95,285.15, sure
286.17,305.94, listening through the back of the right leg so she's actually getting a nice little gas struck stretch here just by getting into position were now going to find that alignment again optimal position through the torso and looking here at whether her palaces a line so the attendant is we going to this position the really high up that left hip
306.18,310.14, all she might start to load into the right
310.23,317.94, usually what we'll see is more of a hike on the left hip so i'm going to just ask her to lengthen through the left soon
318.33,348.54, right meditate patala is placed lightly just protecting on the front of the chair and then you're going to lengthen through the ashes creating support through her shoulder girdle also through her to social so she has that lovely sense of being organized through the center between ribs and calves and then organized through the shoregoin to the hands take a breath in as you exhale pressed the pedal down with that left like so now when looking at docile plan affection on the left side
348.72,356.79, because the knees bent a focusing more on the soles complex again even though the holiest does not attach directly
356.79,360.87, then directly influences the lower leg
361.56,363.03, and is used
363.12,388.53, huge amount in propulsion so we want to have a balance as trusties complex and as we're looking at this exercise again i'm looking at it she able to eat centrically and concentrically control that soles we use the holiest far more centrically functionally than we do concentrically so this is a really important part of me and enclinations
389.91,390.87, and
391.98,395.22, to finish that one and again we can look at
395.22,399.36, linement and control untiring yourself back in the standing
402.9,411.33, back up into starting position so that is a way to look at gastrell's complex using the comether
411.33,415.17, he and lord extremity rehabilitation
415.23,416.82, very much chris
416.85,418.17, you for watching
