4.02,45.84, thank you master is true as it has deferred my name is nicely i work with electronics with mechanics and with conwell jealousy my projects and i after say that i'm moving more and more away from the electronics in the coat and i more and more burkinshaw stomachers this is why i gave the talk a future from the hot west arm but still all my my machines and installations which i build are pretty much inspired by what i know about coding and what i know about electronics
46.38,97.32, i absolutely love hardware stores and i am in the superstition that i just have round the corner from my place to very large heart were stores and what i really like about hardware is the tremendous potential which is in there there are kinds of machines in hardware stores and are not talking about the machines which are already assembled like a religion an electric or more thinking about the machines which are not built at which are thrust in the heart restore but which require your imagination and your time to make them so if you think about plumbing the heroes in combination with vaporous there is just brilliant of stuff in there which treats to be made and it all already in the hardest
98.13,116.37, orators are in my opinion something like toyshop for adults that it consentire they also pretty much look the same and i think it's also his lighter mark now you can turn around it's this light here which probably qualifies me to speak at play and make
116.88,123.63, so talking about children trying to this is me in my childhood her 
123.9,135.9, i knew nothing at the age about dinosaurs but in you everything about the hollow space program so it was very clear that i when i would grow up would want to become an astronaut
135.99,141.66, but at the same time i also wanted to become an artist because i really like drawing
142.38,169.29, and i also wanted to become an inventor because i had a very influential book of for me was the heroic in the technic the big moment in technology and i was totally excited to have about gullies one he has sembloient of the moors code and i really admired tomassen of the light barandalla errante of the telephone
170.34,197.04, but there were also there was also another inventor which was probably even the most influential for me in my time which was other we have the telephone i thought no chiliastic here is a topical he holds five hundred seventy patents he's from germany is the inventor of the plastic wall clock but he also invented children's toy which is called isaac
197.04,237.54, the same people now fisette it still but extremely cruel to advise the construction set out of those plastic stickleford could put together and you could build all kinds of machines with it which were driven then by motors edenhall the my most beloved toy i was playing with this all the time constructing some sort of weird machines addition morning i celestine this it was before i and the age when i went to school i must have been around five years old was a sunday morning my parents were still sleeping and i was building a machine which
237.69,248.07, what's supposed to function with the motor but it didn't work so i investigated the whole mechanism thoroughly and i came up with the conclusion that the batteries were just empty
248.1,286.98, so i also had this extra set her out of those methods and besmeared as i conceive they have to little banana place and you can make some sort of sliding contacts with them and i thought that those methodism energy problem together with the roll out led you have already admired what happened then but i will show it to you so that woke up my parents very fast that sunday morning
287.43,297.15, and i'm telling you this because my methodology is still the same how i work it starts with some sort of curiosity based on this curiosity i develop a theory
297.54,320.79, and then this is followed by an experiment the experiment of course led to result which is that either works out as i expected or it doesn't work out and the when something doesn't work out this is normally the moment where i learned something so this aliquid cool but the coolest thing about this whole procedure is
321.66,367.71, that there is a feedback loop built in because at every stage of when i building something and when i think about it i raise some questions and this leads to further curiosity and then i make again theories and experiments and whatever said like a never ending you can also like an altered this whole picture and we can make a chart what i'm doing is basically i have an idea and i carry it out by myself i don't delicate the to others so it more into the wife than into yesterday up with the conomo let it make by others with is not what i like i am really doing the stuff by myself and i learned not by making stuff by myself and this creates a lot of ideas and people quite often ask me where you get your ideas from
367.71,371.43, that's exactly it because i'm just making my own things
372.54,379.26, so this is my playground it certain old trophies of berlin
379.89,407.7, another question that people ask me quite often is how do we make your money and well easy trick to survive for me is not to pay so much friend or to to keep the running costumery low so this is not only my playground from inside my workshop it's also my living room i'm living there together with my girlfriend cathos also somewhere in the audience and we are also sometimes making projects together
407.91,414.48, the end i will show you some project which we have done together and before i show you your projects which i've done a lot
415.35,465.87, are just start talked about curiosity so of course there is also some slight curiosity problem with such a large shopwindow which has to do with the neighbors they feel very invited to look always inside and that can be nice but it can be also annoying and village decided that i will block the view from my neighbours and hang up the curtain and surprised them with that because they're so used that they can always look inside and i knew that i would surprise them with that so i made a little video about it and i will show you the reactions to
480.03,486.12, i 
507.39,511.68, he
609.81,648.63, to stick with this project for a very short moment you've seen in the video this kind of image recognition of war which i program for this installation sovereignties a very old looming weren't any more
648.78,711.39, and even though this was a very old laboratory useful for a doll bywater stuff any more i still think that this was pretty much high tech there doesn't really exist the definition for high tech but my personal definition of high tech is that this is technology will be imply doesn't exist to one person on this entire planet which completely understand how it works a computer is nowadays and even ten years ago already so complex that i need a team of people which understand how to construct it out to make it and then another team of people which are able to programming system but there is not one thing the person who can like make this from the ground up succour including software and including this imitation and that i'm very much interested in understanding that technology i am surrounded with and which amusing so that resonant really like this kind of high tech even if it's totally outdated
712.29,773.76, another project which i have done distinctive game console and is an augmented reality video game console and there i also tried to implement some computer vision on much simple hardware is basically hard where that could have been built in the seventies already and i wanted just to try out how simple can i get with with computer vision and with the computer where it runs on so that i can still understand somehow what am i doing there then the consul were like this that it some sort of an interface you take some sort of a video signal libero a video camera and then you feel the video signal into the consul and then you gave gout of the consul in turbido monitor and what it does is it overlays the picadores here in this vilifiers
773.94,782.28, were
815.7,848.85, they can try out this game by yourself if you go to call word to the team it certain latest media are missin in germany and there is included now in the new permanent exhibition but if you don't want to go extraction also go to the internet on my web side nicholas room if you stroll down at the project you will find in there and there i described interlopers and also how you can bet your own so there all this comatic online
848.88,851.04, so all the coats
851.52,854.55, if you put the consul
854.7,885.84, make it here mentally on the green this is how the consul looks from inside as i conceive they are not really many parts inside there is actually if you buy all those parts you will say well below tenures and we can have a quick low to look to to what we have there so that the biggest ship on this board is certain at meat micro control long which is basically something the men many of unheardof the art we know so at the very first version of the ardent this was the main trip
886.35,908.16, so it is some sort of little computer that you program on the pandita case i ardente program in sea and then your transformations
908.4,912.66, every computer needs a clock
912.66,925.92, function which is an quiet in that case it's a sixty meetest which runs the computer in opposite to what you have in an mutilators sidedoor
926.34,955.62, then what we also have fears one other trip it's a sin separator this extracts the sink signal out of the video signal and feeds it in the micro controlled for the micro control a nose actually where the picture is drawn at the moment then there are bunch of sisters and borers are basically the graphic that of the whole construction here so they are at the end responsible to drawn image on the screen
956.79,958.53, so
959.82,1017.18, this year is the well an assembly of the data sheet of the micro controller and i have to say that even so i can read this three hundred pages patashie of the micro control and where is exactly described how this trip is supposed to behave and what it can do and what all the different recesses to in there i still have to say that i don't completely understand how it works or my understanding i may be i can understand how it supposed to behave but i don't understand it to be extended actually could build my own microtome i don't know how to at this out of fiorimonde so with the next project it was a workshop where i've been invited to from the school of the arts in often but earlier this year i want to explore the alittle bit further how to computer
1017.54,1076.25, i've been very invited from the professor of the new media class and he asked me if i would have an idea what i could do with the students and i said yeah well let's build computers out of card board and i had actually no idea how you can build a computer out of cardboard but i thought that playing with cardboard besoin that you usually do in the kindergarten and if if you have some sort of a kindergarten skill and bring it to an art cellarette at students will be alterable to make something with it that in the garden skill so what i brought there as an inspiration to the students were three books one was an autobiography of contracts the computer minims lack confesses one of the the computer pioneers who has pulled the started during the second world war to build one of the first computers out of telephone relays
1076.64,1093.5, i also brought them a book personal computer in an open dick this is from the eighth and it separately how piecework at quite funny reheard at the end you have a printer who then prince
1093.83,1124.55, fredegond by when you peer to matrix printer because of you know eight entire book which i brought i suppose which i found in the trash in artaria on the street it's called engineers many note book dictates from radio shack and it explains how all the lattices of the seven thousand four hundred logician of you know about that
1125.06,1154.88, so this is what i brought to the students but well i gave one to step back in time a little bit to once more when that the most also the situation that the the the professor has announced already the workshop to the students while we didn't agree on a diet which put me in quite a good position for negotiations because i knew that he could not step back from this any more and i told him i will only do this work shop if we have one thousand years for materials
1155.33,1161.63, so we bought a lot of really really expensive card board its so called
1161.78,1194.9, what english of to find paper architects like to use this for building model because it's very sturdy desart of very long wood fibres in there and you can tell creasti models out of it and because we had so really nice material i ask the students if they would be okay i would not traditionally teach them something but if i were to sit there and billy own cardboard computer because i was really excited to work with this material and the students were absolutely all right with it
1194.96,1219.95, also turned out that it created a very nice pittering at most fear because we altering out what can we do with this material and then every one was looking at each other and as soon as some one has found out what were well on the other were copying it and by that we were learning very very fast together was a superfund work shop was really nice time i want to show you two students projects of this
1220.4,1245.6, this here is speed way for one thousand from your astonished its arriving simulator but there is some sort of word play in there the pontus stands for miller and german so it it's a trundling simulator because it turned out that the steering was actually quite wobbly
1246.26,1255.08, we documented all those worship resides in animated gifts because this just a very quick way to document something and i don't have to make a full video
1255.41,1264.68, here is another one this was from calibans they were totally into these engines many book for
1265.04,1301.67, i circuit and they have built fully functioning entangle to aramis piece of electronic circuit which every computer has in it a very elementary piece of circe it comprised out of a bunch of resistors and what it basically does it take to input to binary in pots which can be either one or ceremonies an output out of this and that man gate which sets thenceforth not and so it is an inverse and gate is
1301.73,1348.92, especially one amongst all the all the gates because it is a universal gate you can build all other logic gates out of several men gates and then out of all the different logic ate again you can build like everything in a computer you can build memory you can build the whole professor and everything but is needed for the professor to oneleigh we have to impute this athos to slivers when you push them in they represent a one and when you push them out of polhemus and the hero and then the output is on the right side the peace which is sifting out so basically when you billie really many of them and if you have a very very large room and lay them out on the floor you can fill a whole computer with that technology
1352.13,1354.59, i want to show you
1354.65,1358.85, the outcome of my little project there
1359.39,1382.28, i was interested in building a machine which you stipulate set of philopater and put out some sort of an analogue output the decanal touch and this makes mentioned already became a plotter i took the time when i was beckoning to make a little video of it because i really like to document my own works in videos
1382.85,1386.87, and put them on my website because 
1386.87,1404.15, the internet i can actually read too much larger audience than if i would exhibit it in a physical space and also get a knot of knowledge from the internet about the works and how technical things are done this is while always like to put stuff back on the internet when they are done like
1405.56,1417.35, the internet and then i put it back somehow filletoville at the medium
1440.24,1446.27, so the digital memories geronte left side this book the tense
1459.86,1460.79, he
1462.89,1463.76, he
1466.4,1467.21, he
1474.89,1475.7, he
1479.66,1480.59, he
1496.28,1505.61, once those lying here which are strong and total cut with the knife so we didn't use any layer cut her to a drawing on the cardboard and then cut it with his
1509.3,1515.72, people are asking me constantly about the could have construction plans of this but i to say i'm sorry
1515.75,1530.15, there were simply no plans i just started to work at started to work with certain elite sliding things for the pen and he added up and up and up in a trusteeship at the beginning i didn't look i didn't know how it would look like at the end
1537.08,1538.16, he
1545.66,1549.77, then i used to write down the title of organs
1551.0,1555.68, pretty much looking in the future
1560.57,1565.76, he 
1567.47,1569.18, so
1569.24,1575.69, now we have been alike futuristic technology spilled with bywater is
1576.59,1593.6, but let's get even more for touristic and let's go a little bit more into the hardware store direction here we have a bunch of hard westerners on the floor of this church this is now a workshop which happened to monaco
1594.2,1614.42, you have been invited to give a workshop at the kites in a inverallachie not far from here and the topic this year was next utopian so the asasiel have an idea for that and we suggested that it would be actually coolie would transform ourselves into cyborg
1614.96,1627.65, but we also thought that it would be quite interesting if i would make sport out of ourselves which don really work with electronics but instead presswork with those heart rest or materials
1628.46,1659.75, so again i want to show you two examples of what the participants have done this is the project of ianthe thought that it would be quite nice if they wouldn't have to use the parentintins but they wanted to use the energy of the rocking itself or of the waking and bellamie which produces them sound based on their movements again we have documented this in animated gifts so let's have look
1660.08,1675.98, put some sound under a heretic
1675.98,1693.59, see that was like a row going to the back to this papacies some rattling and enticing the chin who eenside this funnel another project which i really liked was from martinsart
1694.16,1729.95, and he thought that it would be to make some sort of sacrifice painting machine which would allow him to to take up the neighbourhood in about four meter height without taking a letter with him so you this pipes which are usually used to put in the ball and then you put electric cables through them this is very cheap material very light weight and you can build construction quite easy with them and then they built this platter machines in which was benconceld by a bicycle break and you had
1730.01,1738.8, protection over your head out of her plastic ball because it there was some he was some spray paint always coming down
1739.52,1752.81, for this is the device in action here by pulling on the rope secret move the spray can on top then alida little mirror that he could see what he is painting but it turned out to belitha it's easier castello up there
1754.13,1825.77, and again for this work shop a cut in mere excited already beforehand that we also thought we should build our own siostra tions and we wanted to try out what we can do with those kind of materials caryatide that it would be really nice if she would have like a rain for machine which would create a rainbow around her all the time and we made that two withernsea general purpose precious prayer which is probably usually is to poison the appetite garden added a note then like the the pipe was sealing haddon this rainbow head as i can see when it practitioner in sunlight it creates a really nice rainbow around you and i am not very tall sometimes i wish i were a little bit taller i saw i have filled this head level extension device for myself which would elevate my perception by the height of one head so that i can look on other people's head stone when i wear it and also i can hear a little bit higher i didn't want to go so far that also smell higher because this
1826.01,1836.03, i like the style of how it was so this was built out of a construction helmet where i cut a lot of and then the noise canting headphones which are
1836.03,1839.72, connected again with those electric comes to some funnels
1841.55,1852.77, so now we are at the at the future here of well how we can develop a mankind and what the next level will be but a
1853.01,1911.21, yea we have nice group picture also this is all of us together but i want to go a little bit back in time and i want to come to them he retorted ideas of mankind be ideas for inventions which never became true up to now and i want to talk about a perpetration machines the title motion machine that sir that the idea which came up for the first time in the eighth century already not far from here in the marian i didn't find any pictures of that in the internet but i found on the left side a drawing from lunatic is from around fourteen hundred nineteen and he has drawn a so called unbalanced well that so we which is more heavy and one side so once you start to spin it it always puts its weight to one side and becomes my heavy there and it would theoretically spin on it on and on and on the same construction you can see on the right side is from nineteen hundred twenty a magazine cover
1911.6,1942.14, and i thought you the bitings of mankind busier problems i will i will tackle them when i was invited to the tent in roughing polylas year there had an artist residence which basically means that they invited me for one month of time gave me some money for producing something and i had absolutely freedom of what i could do so i thought i would build such perpetration machine 
1942.14,1951.74, the elevator here we see a drawing outworks but i don't want to get too much into this because i can i have a video which explains it very well
1952.22,1959.03, i 
1984.11,1985.73, he
2054.43,2055.66, he
2069.97,2075.64, i 
2088.72,2166.33, the trick of making videos is that the kenmare something make look like it would work perfectly unfortunately did not work perfect i mean it were perfectly for two hours but after two hours the complete completely broke a treacle the service technician and i was a feeling really bad about this because i thought i would call ignorant of coolest centre they probably don't have so much money anyway so i asked the technician if i can go to the control room with him this is the picture which i've taken there and what you cannot see on this picture is how really hot it was in there it was it is a rich elevator so what happens is that every time when the evenings when we entered the room it was really could have made a saintete machine which i still was actually a control room on her in a way this proof
2166.51,2168.16, as an invention
2168.31,2203.11, which puts me back to my childhood dreams where wanted to become an astronaut an artist an inventor and it's quite obvious that well this with the inventor if i ever tried this i would put a big question mark there it's not really clear i mean my machines obviously fail but still even though failing machines still sempill seem to qualify us art so i can say that i'm an artist now this is how i make my money and all make my living and i did not become an astronaut unfortunately not
2203.62,2215.59, but i also have to say that i didn't really my put much effort in this carrier pass the only thing that i've done the past for the years is better eben brushing my peace on a regular basis
2215.68,2243.25, what i know is that the strongest of the polar program really had to have lawless my picardy or right condition right now which means that this guy here john glen at the time when this paths been taken he was seventy seven years old he is the oldest human being who has ever been in space and the well seventy seven years i still have quite some time the ice
2244.39,2282.4, but now i want to come to the let's last project in my presentation and i want to stick with the shame of the artist of being an artist i know that there are some arts enteric also want to become artists in the future and i can tell you it's accuser easy to become an artist and i will show you how it works with his last project again it was an invitation to poenitentiam make an installation there
2282.52,2287.11, which was some sort of funny because we really don't have any background in street at
2287.68,2310.51, i made the one when i was sixteen years old one graffiti now looked at it the next morning and it was so shipshape up right away again but we do have quite an expertise in street level shop france so we thought it would be quite nice if we would just have such a shop front and pick up people from the street and make instant artists out of them
2312.46,2339.85, the street or festival has organized as this banter was empty for more than ten years and before it served as a what kabar the was in quite a bad condition but with a little bit of pain to be made an art gallery out of that and in that art gallery in the shop window we were putting this device here which is looks like an easy at the first glance but it's a painting machine which is rope controlled
2339.85,2397.45, i have constructed this machine in google ketchup which i really like for constructing those kind of things and then you are totally at heart weston aerial like everything that i needed to build this machine we found it in the hortator so i just made this instead then i printed out the plans how they look like on them now they would be on them on the sheets of wood i printed that out with the interpreter greeted on the wood and testatrix soon cut it out there is no like sincerer or so involved in it it had basically by the tools which i like most to build such a thing is a computer to get information and the printer to get something physical out to treat intrepreter and then a careless rail and an electric or this is like my fable at home and again the plans for this are on my website so have looked there if you want
2397.75,2431.65, and you can build one your own i don't really believe in copyright i believe in that you can just you my stuff and make whatever you want with it anything was too to create those professional art carriers so we did not just want the people to make at work in the shop window we really wanted them to become professional artists which means they had to make money with their artist painting as well and again i made a video and i waive you with this video this will be the end of my talk enjoy it
2431.98,2596.56, teetotalers verifiability in interesting teetotallers
