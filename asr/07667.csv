293.31,296.91, and after three years later grow hides
298.8,301.26, local water mills disappeared
304.92,307.41, that everybody need to see
307.86,309.09, a choice
310.05,313.65, that's no law local seat left in that area
313.83,315.87, many places allowed
318.69,321.69, the price of a rising up very fast
325.35,326.52, the beginning
326.61,327.66, only
328.5,329.73, maybe
330.48,332.31, the party
333.0,334.56, a full
334.77,339.03, later the price go up to a thousand but peculiar
340.2,345.3, at the end now the price of what eminency go up to
345.81,347.76, but
349.92,352.08, it's not happened with

354.15,357.15, happened with all capacities
359.16,360.99, that he or it
363.15,364.95, a thing i feel like
366.24,367.89, is not normal
367.89,370.41, to buy seats and sea
371.73,373.2, it had to be
373.41,374.91, it's been like a
379.35,386.13, so the price of this bottomley in the village now is about ten thousand but
387.39,390.33, three hundred dollars per kilo
391.44,396.36, and the farmer inability they have over it in come about
396.42,400.83, the debonnaire dollars for a year
402.03,403.59, if a farmer
404.1,405.99, want to go what

419.7,420.75, but it
420.96,423.27, the need to think about where to get money
423.27,424.98, the beginning of debt
425.34,426.75, for life
427.59,428.7, now
