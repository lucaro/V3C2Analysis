1054.47,1058.46, come up as a squadron commander we didn't have an assignment for market
1058.46,1075.53, we knew that they would work that out and that i was going to have to leave them for a period of time before we knew were going to be back together i think we're doing well i think we got a long way to go i think we're very relevant even though the world may not have realized how relevant here it takes bad prestige attention but
1075.71,1082.52, i like to believe that were relevant that our people are starting to see and by him to the fact that we are
1083.99,1106.73, release going on the first operator so we started getting incentive pay for what we do considering her not with our family for half earth was awesome or altogether new sites for weapons things like that after the secretary arose came here she started implementing all this stuff and i come down pretty quick imagine

1113.24,1121.7, nature of the air force as there's a lot of phase type things where this phase where pain attention to this type of thing but then i pass out we don't care about it
1121.76,1125.54, that to her i asked her what are we doing to sustain these changes
1125.69,1129.71, she spoke about the budget and the five year plan attached to it
1129.71,1131.66, she said that it's
1131.81,1179.0, a goal of hers and make sure these initiatives and these changes that we've made dick after a lot of study and research and traveling out the bases and meeting directly with our arminius groups and meeting with those leaders on the scene there's a lot of changes that are in the works the new careerists are number one mission in the air force we have got to put our money were our mouths are moralisation as evidenced by a recent survey an anonymous survey that they told the like where we're going the defenders like the uniform maintenance loves being able to have part morale is on the increase i have seen it from the old days you know the one callieen that when the moralite bottom during the middle of the big destination
1179.15,1183.35, all the way up to now where i really feel like morale is just to the 
1183.89,1190.49, i really think that the initiative the attention that we've gotten it's all been positive
1190.49,1193.07, there listening to our voice
1195.41,1219.26, he
