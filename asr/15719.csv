0.09,67.41, the sanctuary project has been a project with the artist lay sexton who did the edition sanctuary and we were with the local promise called temple tahutmes and the teacups have the children come here and work with the artist and then go over to the education cantankerous in response to the exhibition that both saint welcome to hide and to my expectantly and the so many questions before i am oberwesel things that you all kind of brought up and that i could respond to
69.0,81.3, looking really closely i think and i think your teachers have been working with you back at school on what i actually do on these fabrics that i work with that there are special sentries just for animals
81.3,90.36, then i also think as an artist it into think that museums and art galleries like hiding are also a kind of sanctuary
90.36,95.13, so i sing to mary is a place where things like as
95.25,133.83, or safer than they would be if those things weren't there and i in to think that in a gallery like hide which has an art collection and historical collection and like the museums and libraries around the world that actually placed to keep those objects safe so that we don't lose them and also as somebody said when animals do go extinct if they are extinct in the wild they may be kept in the sanctuary they may be the only species left for the museum might be the only place you can see that animal like the caroline parricide what about primroses museums to be an educational centre
133.86,266.76, and education is that the forefront of everything we do and we welcome several thousand students to hiding every year this exhibition has been particularly interesting to us as we have seen many cities from retrocedere engaged with what he was saxophone i found her really important as a school and a talkin that we make a connection with our local gallery which is hiding the program we have it school connected with the artist loison's worded the children created vertebration of lois's world the opportunity to come here and to have a look at the gallery face to be inspired by an artist and indited has on workshop so there seybert take all the votes experiences tactical and which the aino the thing i like about ideas that we got to look around at all the arts that are the papered and a critical alike to make in my picture in the outworks well it's really interesting to see rotharis opinions baranathee are come up with we can look in it a token learn about the man you care a question is i can answer you i realise severer thing that i dislike going to aerostation very interesting to see all this wild life i like all around the categories and like seeing how the action of made in learning about it i inappropriately like it at school usually have to go with like the subject like if it's made need it be in my amaranth but then i just can be myself casionally an we can his children as an artist great privilege because they are so open to your ideas to what you do and then then giving them the freedom to respond to that and to see what they do is actually very inspiring and they
266.76,876.63, asked really fantastic questions in the space they were intrigued by the materials and by the time it takes to make the work the value of the project for student has been really good because it places the student at the center of the morning experience but coming to the exhibition space and may get to have their own responses and reactions to the outworks that they feel and then they are introduced to the aristocrat what they are in temples with the outworks and a really lovely that always the children came up with exact sort of responses that the out of as intended to accosted there and talk to the students about waterworks were bodies and you know delivering that way to the children but when they come up with that information they take on a ship on it themselves they know what it's like playing or what the words mean and represent it because they have said that themselves and then have the oresteia to them about what it is that the assistants and confirming the things that they came up with his really valuable is interesting which is seen and how she made all the outwork i think she was inspired by pictures that had been drawn by it adscititious in to see the real thing aircastles together shakspeares and looks at them she had lots of color and disputable elsewhere ver expression he had at that time it really depends on what he seacliff happy or if your sad and teasing me an idea of what if i haven't seen a bird before i get me an idea of what it looks like in and it won't it make me so happy and it's an ixperience that i would like to try i told to the children that morning about how a sanctuary is for animals for natural species to keep them safe and protected but how this also a relationship with the with museums and with objects are historical objects that with artworks in keeping them safe a museum is a place to keep those most in save those things from the past and i together about the materials that are using and the way in which i am trying to give those old discarded materials in your life and that this is a sanctuary for those materials this space scalery these new forms are a century for those disappearing materials one of the great things about working with children in in the gallery and in the museum and doing a workshop with the after them seeing the work is that they have that first hankering with tenants hearing while an artist says about their work on inspire them that then having the freedom to to express themselves there not being asked to do one particular thing there being given materials and techniques which in themselves are interesting there are allowed to respond to an inch have a way they want and what's interesting about doing a college were shot with the children is that every child is something different in unitatis inspiring for me as an artist the earl is called the orange motherless orange beak and a caricature a very brightly stand out a lot well i accelerating up to do a bit but i hope the wittemore penitentiary in the aorist because i thought it nilotica find a ordinary dragon i just really like the craters in nowise at me because i read books about gianbattista they usually have very long tails and i discommode show it swanlike making it come off the page everybody says there like facets and badmashes in the boyson the bad side back i don't see in like that i did the bird fixing it to poison the mind and i look really nice stuff i first saw the bird and i am still thought of like sea waves and sir i thought about my time at features and mason and sir i said creating a look of the pitch fondues really love because the gentilities that by being can have their initial responses to our works and have i feel about being in the space and what that means and that's really inspiring for a lot of children to have had that experience before it and some other children were saying to day how much fun that they had and then i followed it up with a question well have you been learning as well and may all told me all the things of the belaving about the psamatik about in sandals and thinking about processes that aristor and that's really important for learning that we get a space to be able to think about different ways of generating knowledge of understanding the world and making meaning in the world around us or i think that like he fife goes to be learnt to think about it more and that's a good thing about excursionising sir apathetic work and not really getting the footprint of fiesole going into an exhibition to seeing her out workmen her and telling her and asking her questions about her outward italianate fine and ostentation of more fun that he then more exciting began assomption in government as to just asking question anticipated it really uninitiated taiwan come with my family so i came and sir every one else could learn what i have experienced moistening somewhere that isn't school is interesting i like all the outwork and inner explore more initiation programs in art museums are really fantastic it when i was growing up there were no programs like this i didn't have any artist in my family growing up people made things by hand or and that is always inspired me exclusions for teachers is really valuable because they get to see how the teachers we tested so they get to focus on the students in the different way that they do in the classroom it's a complainer atmosphere and peoples gadalina be friendly they can have a compensation outside of school and they can talk about what it is that they're experiencing together and this is really valuable for teachers because they continents bastarache get use the museum as a resource within the classroom so they can come and visit the museum and have an experience with children that they can antanaclasis upon the children's learning techstone to excursions and visits to museums and aglare for a considerable time after they actually had the vices the visits are also sanemori for a long time so every one can remember there on experiences of having visited museums and galleries when they were children and you carried with that for the rest of your life significance for me as a teacher airing whenever stop learning and panama found it that connection very really strong at certainly have a curriculum tattheration to where children can certainly get inspired for the loading to grow as well socially making that connection between highlands and a score with some brilliant nanting on very proud of its really valuable for the museum from time to time to be able to offer a schools a deeper richard prince with the students come and spend the whole day at hay where they get to experience the gardens the different exhibition spaces and they get to talk to an artist and find out about their processes and make something in me sideration sentinels at holistic experience but children have and as much deeper and richer for their learning what are the great things but worthinesse ting their work in excisions like we have done in the contemporary projects bothering is that we are able to their work to perhaps change the way people feel about the war in which they live we certainly hope he can do that trinitatis programs so that we had students who leave her inspired that no one make a beatin differently about other objects of their around them the material culture of their lives the simple objects of the habitans and the reason why are smart recycled and reduce lovingly produced forms and turn a into the relief worse that we serenissimo a holly steeper in a way they get to look at art they get to experience the gardens and get a sense of the history of hardy but they also get to make a airholes that that's quite special and not every school has that opportunity and phidippides the opportunity for school fatally reach out to school tax recommend gage in that way they are soon programs on the weakened through the school holidays so it's you know if it when i was a child i would have loved have had the experience of haitian available to infinitude realistically
