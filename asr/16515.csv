197.22,205.59, are always sense the real need to do so but become so fearful that i must slip and fall on my death whenever i try to find romantic love
206.7,210.72, eventually i found myself standing next to the young woman with a camera
211.08,217.44, to her and thought maybe i could approach her with my camera to make it easier to start a conversation
217.86,224.49, didn't know what to say so instead i kept filling her as though my camera would do the talking for me
