1687.44,1693.02, but perishable food products like vegetables and fruit
1693.02,1696.77, the need for that's not noway
1696.77,1709.43, in course he is pushed for adoration local being on again to actually altogether and nothing would take advantage of all those and

1753.68,1755.99, then we do improve it
1756.05,1767.09, i guess that's statements important ones not that i think i'll ever make any money off of his important to 
1767.45,1776.99, so we're going to continue to push that region and i guess as i tried always to him my life i don't disobey else lose opinionate

1839.42,1848.03, but it will be by most of our cucumbers from my friends denouements are a year a few coppers
1848.09,1861.02, but it's part of the overall pigeon and i think that the thing that still left out there that we got to accomplish as a group of vose got to get to aggregation fontesque
1861.2,1866.33, that aren't going to be
1867.35,1884.57, a good farming but maybe they haven't mastered the market instead of some of those under things that have to do attendants gas together so that we can aggregate your products and breitenbach people that
1884.57,1902.12, observe the streeters retail grocery markets at the end behind that we would still rely back on some of the safari market where example the large one in plantations still very great much a big part of what georgia
1902.12,1904.28, the culture were there
1906.47,1913.16, i think what we're trying to do is just to people in her and starting to move

1940.4,1942.8, and get it started right now
1942.83,1944.03, and
1944.27,1949.07, what you hear and see over the next of years as a lot of emphasis on his
1949.13,1953.24, obviously people like me but 
1953.6,1965.6, more people involved in the state eventfulness on people we had a meeting in course or disinter him not sure what it is appropriate a representative
1966.92,1979.67, my brothers appeared would get in with ancient venture their died in what we're doing and so the thing california able to get fragrantia estein to
1979.79,1980.96, i
1981.11,1985.73, not a bit commentaries
1985.79,1990.26, but if you're going to play a fair game everybody's got to have same to let
1990.38,1999.65, but we want to make sure it's evident from our present in an obviously agricola to wear for everybody for repetition the
