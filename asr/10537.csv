18.45,24.27, i let say that this video was not shot in bolivia or brazil
24.51,28.17, it is just the same about the jungle round the world
28.38,31.29, this file contains no people whatsoever
31.59,33.12, no people at all
33.27,37.32, it is however but the indigenous people everywhere and specifically
38.67,42.15, human beings and bolivia and brazil
44.76,63.99, a near move a foot to contaminate the homeland of the indigenous people the people of bolivia because politicians believe that they are poor people what is one defined poor politicians in bolivia believed that these people
64.29,66.27, two isolated
66.66,68.85, one to find isolation
69.54,74.85, i am not familiar with the politics of olivia but i am aware of the politics in other countries
75.18,85.59, there are in other countries people who run for office because it is in their best interests it is the third easiest way to make money
86.31,94.14, in an office they believe it's a great way to peter influence to the rich and mighty people be damned
94.23,98.76, and to better dollar sorry that's all i can for to day but
99.0,104.07, sartin bolivia could it be and i'm just pass in here
104.25,108.36, it be that the push to this place indigenous people believe
108.36,110.1, all about money
110.16,111.99, big business
117.9,122.07, read about the intimidation of the native people in their drums
122.61,132.36, i read about the lynching the murder the burning of homes the killing of babies and women just as in the history of the so called civilized industrial countries
132.84,137.85, because they are of a different race different
138.03,150.66, once again it seems that a naval people of brazil are under attack just as in other countries with unfortunate tacit support of politicians these people have no value
152.16,159.63, the use of the land is far more important than the people destroying the jungle is progress it is the order of the day
159.78,161.01, so they say
164.64,175.14, you may well be sitting at your laptop watching this saint yourself that your country is far too civilized for anything like that to happen here
175.62,181.26, i look around you what is the race of jungle to concrete
181.8,184.83, the privileged race where you live
184.86,189.12, do they still murder young unarmed men because it is tradition
189.99,197.82, people still divided by race government supported look at their forms had made to believe that one is superior to the other
198.18,201.09, you personally take pride into active
201.12,205.89, or agitate in front of your nationality as a source of pride
206.55,217.92, to me making people to believe in the trivialities that suggest separation makes it so much easier for good people to do nothing
219.96,222.96, do i care about the indigenous people everywhere
223.05,234.96, because i am a part of the human race the only race that matters the fact that indigenous blood run through my benches really not that important nor is it the impetus for sharing this information
235.62,246.45, i am a part of the human race sitting in front of my big t admire my bran nut car an my concrete dry way does not allow me to not care
247.83,250.83, if your child is my business
251.25,265.11, of your daughter is my business the destruction of your force is my business the separation of you from your natural spirituality as a sea from money is my business
265.38,276.18, i see life in very simple terms i am my brother's keeper even though my brother even though he thousands of miles away
281.22,286.02, what you do to my brother you also do to me
287.19,290.37, as an uneducated man and i am
290.91,300.99, i try my best to see through the fog of politics and think for myself of course because i'm a human being my conclusions are not always correct
302.82,309.12, i try to see through the smoke of hate fear and read into the motives of so called politicians
309.54,316.5, and i try to ask this question every time by her political speech
317.55,321.57, what are you really selling is this separating me
321.6,323.49, my brother and sister
323.67,331.23, is it a veil to this guide to destruction of a people or person even if they had lived in a jungle home
332.61,343.08, i'm not telling you to think as i do all i ask you to do is to think for yourself and reach your own conclusions
