0.27,20.82, was sauverand and millinery much for the invitation and come and give this talk are the title to an see on the slide as miles title if i am my title now in terms of the work i do contestants and i certainly don't want is to be self promotional what i'm trying to do to tell you what amenities
20.91,25.29, we are trying to do in terms of reducing side effects from drugs
25.38,33.18, now we have a lot of work to do in this area to bring parents into the nets in a wholesale fashion
34.26,39.99, so i'm not position as middleton said and i run a clinic
40.05,42.93, for patients with civil hypertension
43.02,45.57, when patients are referred to me
45.66,64.08, for treatment of the hypertension i will obviously look at them in the entire at intense of taking history examining them and find out what was the level of blood pressure is what are the drugs that taking one with the ages and etcetera all these factors listed
64.71,88.89, there are four main classes of drugs which are available for hypertension and i want us the same drug in every patient i will choose what i think is the best drug depending on the clinical factors that i elicit from taking a history from a patient and talking to the patient is power madelene important in what we do in terms of treating the patient so what i am doing
88.89,100.17, i am taking a particular patient has been referred to me is personalizing treatment to datil patient some individualizing doses are individualizing which drugs are dedicated
100.47,109.5, the personalization should be happening with every physician every doctor who eats patients with drugs and that's been around a long time
112.26,126.09, what we're doing is trying to use the best drug for the patient according to what is known at the moment or from trials from other kinds of studies and what in the tens of guidelines
126.33,136.35, this is not perfect and an everybody appreciates is not perfect and the reason that it's not perfect is that we can't predict
136.41,140.22, with patient is going to respond to that drug in the beneficial way
140.4,156.99, for example in depression it said that may be percent of patients respond to the first revolve the certificat response lightly to the drug and so he present unresponded tall a man so that you have to go and find another drug to see whether the respondentia certain certain with again
158.16,167.7, don't know which contingents effects to medicines and we trying to develop methods to be able to overcome some of these side effects and policemen
168.15,211.56, and this is seen in some of the date that we published many patients still develop side effects and clearly this is important to be able to develop mechanisms to me be to reduce the side effects so that we can treat our patient better so the maximize benefits from drugs and minimize arms so we did this big study in musician hospitals are where we looked at in the perspective fashion at about nineteen thousand patients and this is over six months and we found that twelve hundred twenty four patients that are six and a half patronesses of patients were mitted to our two hospitals directly because of agostina when we extract late this to the nevada
211.83,242.01, found that this probably cost and habal a billion pounds per and that those huge figures and what we need to do is to be able to bring those figures down and try to include that and what we've been trying to do in liverpool within their research group that i work in is really to try to cantefable what is going on of the moment so that we can bring in intervention strategies to improve this and reduced the harms associated with medicines
242.76,245.04, and so when i prescribe
245.22,252.72, what i'm doing is is clearly trying to maximize the benefits of a drug and minimize the arms
252.78,258.27, unfortunately this doesn't ache the time as faust told you
259.74,266.43, so the many reasons why habebant in individual patients
266.52,268.26, the optimal
268.53,284.67, one is genetic and i'm going to spend most of my time on the genetic factors i'm going to tell you exactly what politics but i don't want to say that everything is related to genetics a lot of maybe environmental clinical practice and the discometer listed on the slide
284.7,296.43, example some patients forget to take the medicines and some patients come to my clinic hypertension cites doctor forgot to take the drug one day to the next day i took two tablets
296.58,324.81, that does happen is still a very quickly and clearly definitely dispose itself acting in one way or another at one issue is pursuing by the doctor and i think of the time maxwell be presenting on the canesters which are going on to improve the education of prescribes a latiner important and that clearing is to continue at in the graduate level and an instant ned throughout the doctor's life or in bodies because you know that nurse and pharmacist can also prescribe now
325.14,372.12, and also to their drugs that people take the can interact with each of the cleanly these may be drugs to slide by doctor and he may not be aware for interruption or in the order he may have decided to use them any way because it was dedicated to see but sometimes patients also take drugs in one area where i i just want to focus on foot one side two slides is really herblets twenty five per cent of the population take her bement and helmets cannon tract with certain drugs i'm just going to tell you about one patient i saw when i was doing awaited
372.51,386.46, and she had a history of reflux that is she had hired a cane and he had inflammation of her gullet and for that treatment she had been put on a drop collars which is a drug which reduces as it reflects
386.61,394.29, reduces acid production and don pardon which helps to reduce some of the sailors well but 
395.46,400.74, the insets noted that she was all these drugs but nobody had asked her
400.8,410.94, with it she was on taking anything else so i went through the drugs lives taking including drugs that she may have a betaking herself both from polonaise
410.94,413.49, and she was also taken some john ward
413.55,440.01, also taking every she was also taking ginseng and garlic varieties matter as it is a perfectly harmless well in fact i always happening here was a very complex interruption and i do want to go to the specific of the interaction but basically john's wares the ability of lands opposite breakdown lands of present deliver
440.04,491.04, therefore the patient wasn't getting enough one of the and that promoted the reflux of the welcome back and she then developed intonation of the close was also taking three drugs which affect the plateaus and garlic and by themselves they may not be very efficient at locking plateau take them together to completely paralyze the places so he was lady who was not getting enough and to recomendation said the galatea inflamed and he was taking drugs or heroes which were affecting a place less so that she started oozing from my inflamed area and sated vomiting blood and cleanly some education on the on the part of inconsolable of these heretics as well as doctors taking appropriate to histories would have been important in trying to prevent some of these problems
491.88,528.21, do let me just go to genetic itself and somatic one message improve the benefit harm balance of the drugs used to what is famines will follow it entices a term which is introduced in nineteen fifty seven by german homologies are called brogans he said that we were in the way we respond to drugs and there may be genetic differences between us which there are an outcome back to that minute which are determined the fact that we can vary in the way response drugs so they argenton is a study of the genetic basis
528.27,532.77, the difference between individuals in the way we respond to drugs
536.25,554.13, this is the basis and goal of amantis so if i just step away and try to show you the disappointed said aristide so at the moment this is what we do is treat all patience and with the same kind of drugs coming through a particular clinic for example
554.13,565.32, that group of actions you may have the green are individual here who are very good responded some patients who don't are wide outside effects and some places to unresponse to
565.47,596.73, genetics will help us to do is to identify those who are in the blue and those who are in the orange so do can remove these non respondents and give them something else or remove those patients who develop side effects into them something else so what will be left with are these individuals in the green corresponds to the drug first time so that they get the right dose at the right time at the right at the right dose and desists is the basis of persian and the way to ethics and may help in the future
598.38,627.99, we have enormous amount information to be able to help us try to do this and develop the evidence based for it the human tempest was published in two and then with a something called harmac and basically what this is is the map of the genetic variation within the human population and so if i look at human copulation and respective race color creed ninety nine when nine percent of a human gnome is exactly the same
627.99,652.44, it percent is different and point one percent quite to battalion different letters if you like within you human enrich a different antinous and that obviously produces a lot of variability and that responsible for a determining a height collapsible wearing its harlequin or heroes gray
653.1,665.67, and this kind of variability is also seen in liverpool and despite what you may see a onnentisati and and what internet says
667.89,684.03, so what are the sources of variability within the body which can affect the way a people respond to drugs and differently a response drugs will you can divide them into two different categories one which is called someone and one which is called tornadic
684.36,725.4, what is a comet will falconets to what the body does to the drug when you take a drug the drug goes into your stomach into your small intestine and it is absorbed from there it is transported in the blood to the area that it is to work on a intention red of by the liver and that way the drug is usually broken down and then the tetrabranchiata drugs is excited from the body with kidneys in the urine and this the whole process of this is cometic and fanatics varies between different individuals and a cabinet atention mental factor is at the drug being taken as a shower
725.85,728.67, then the second aspect is formulaic
729.63,732.18, what the drug does to the bodies
732.75,772.41, and the drug will interact with various disliking the southwold be a receptor it could be enigmatical it could be iron channel i would in the south this old big coating in the cell in which can also very withered dividual and that also it leads to some of the issues in terms of variability in the way we respond to drugs seeking imagine that there are many different parmaceti processes and there are huge number and some of them have discovered of paradynamics processes and trying to piece like together is trying to piece a million word a million pieces thickset and it will take time to call those places together
775.02,780.81, give you an example where it has worked wonderfully well and this is what the drug called back
780.96,783.42, but as
783.75,797.4, a drug which is used in his disease it is a very effective drug it works in combination with that the drugs and reduces the vilest conduct detectives in the patient's blood stream
799.38,806.1, this drug unfortunately causes a serious attestation which is characterized by a skin rash
806.16,809.64, restlessness sometimes affecting your stomach
809.94,814.11, and impatience who are recalling the drug it can cause death
814.2,818.67, this occurs in the box fierce of the population it tasted
818.76,827.22, i worked on by a group in a strainer a group in the north america and ourselves in liverpool and manchester
827.22,844.41, to a very strong association with one particular game which is uncommon six in the human body and the gnome is dey don't into member but that's a genaman we found was with important in predisposing to this battery hypersensitivity reaction
844.44,846.72, what we were also able to show
846.72,855.78, this is important for the ants because as doesn't have unlimited resources as we were but to show that if we were to put this test into dailies
856.05,858.87, tested everybody was going to go into a back of her
858.87,864.24, this would reduce the incidents of hypersensitivity and would save the neches money
864.81,871.47, this was taken up by the attacking a bystander and since then of two thousand five
871.71,874.53, in this country
874.59,883.92, has had has been doing this test when he were a patient is about to go on the back and what has been the effect of this has been beneficial
883.92,888.99, he certainly has been if you look at this and data from a clinic in brighton
889.08,905.13, before the spice of decentest ing was introduced the frequency of hypothetical six and a half to scent which is a kind of frequency you see to out the world for this before this test was introduced since two thousand five two thousand six i think brighten introduced it
905.16,908.37, the frequency hypersensitivity is gone down to zero
909.06,925.32, this is a genetic test which is worth in practice it was found in the laboratory in it was in critical practice being using hirnio years which is not very long within medical sufferer to the to get that continent
925.38,946.32, this is now being shown all over the world in australia there's a reduction in incidence of hypersensitivity with this test in france same thing in the united states is dates were not coming to any other clinic in london and salivation advance to forget
947.52,956.82, so we were now i'm just telling exactly what we're going to do at the old being at the moment resolute pro which is very important which is worse for him
957.09,965.34, trinitarian run in terms of tractates widely used at least a six hundred thousand people in the car
965.82,1009.8, it's used for some billets they heard of atticus to prevent strokes from a people who are irregular harems and there is a huge variability in the dotation and what unfortunate happens in some patients and is that they get pleasin this eighty two year old lady who is on warrior six weeks who develop this plead in her leg in a car massanutton spend a couple of wits in hospital trying to recover from this and learn to wooden woant to do to prevent this now a lot of work has been going on throughout as well as throughout the world in trying to improve how we use warren
1009.89,1014.12, and work done here the funded by the deportment of house
1014.24,1032.12, by the nile is shown that there are two main gems and again they listened of here i gained know what the optically but this one is in the bianca and one is a people fifty and i'm the one of the manichaean offering and deliver
1032.15,1045.92, in those partly responsible for some of the very ability to see more but clearly environmental factors important again comes back to my point before the country genetic by self you have to look into a genetic
1045.95,1050.69, environmental at together and the interaction between the two nature and nurture
1051.14,1063.89, an agent body with also affect how much worried by the patient and utilizing these four factors weaken account of fifty five percent of the variability and requirements of altering in terms of daily doses
1064.25,1080.81, so hopefully we can try to improve the way we use african so are we doing at the moment and we've just been founded by the european community to do a trial on this and on the trial is about to start and it is going to be held in seven centers in europe
1081.17,1104.57, with two thousand seven patients did nitiation waterall be some uncanceled but there are other kinds of antiquities which i used in other parts of europe and these enlisted are and on the slight enucleation are undiseased same time so we have three tries it to like going on side by side in different countries in europe and what we do in here is using a point of cares
1104.57,1108.83, this means is that we have this black box which is in every clinic
1108.83,1131.51, be able to take a single blood spot from your finger put this into the machine and it will be able to tell us your genetics for these three gens for these three ticular variants in sixty minutes and this tacit hopefully goncourt less than ten pounds to be able to do this but caldicot use evaluated yet but it will hopefully will be less and that's what we aim into
1131.63,1152.63, the portiere is that we testing and where the farmer could genetics improves the whether we can be how we can use affairs the safety of warren with the also a test whether we can use these kind of technologies within the clinical situation so that we not harming patients by using technologies which have been adequately tested and that's very important
1153.32,1162.11, and this is a very important trial which is this a similar trial is also going on in the united states to start again next year
1163.22,1169.55, hopefully the lessons from this will then be incorporated into where the way we use water within the niches
1170.27,1179.39, whatever we try to do is we tried to close the new there's no point using a genetic variation within a human being
1179.42,1197.87, not the need to show that that if you then prescribe that drug to show that that genetic variation and utilizing the genetic relation to the way you prescribe the broth actually makes a benefit to the pension so in the kind of work that we're doing is the way trying to close the loop were going from a sorry
1199.43,1211.58, trying to find this variation and then really go round the circle and show that his having a positive cocoons it is maximized benefits of the drugs and minimizing harms of the trucks
1211.94,1224.33, what i've tried to do is that we require evidence to do this evidence evidence evidence all the time and this does take a long time to be able to produce the evidence and without the evidence as it is it is
1224.36,1239.27, maybe that some genetic dismally harmed the patients rather than benefit patients and it is a work that we do and the work that is going on to act this country is really to build up the evidence face olenin reduced the prime genetic tests
1239.27,1268.67, and evidence passion which is dear to maximize benefit and not harm the patients and this is seen in some of the issues which are already out there and insinuation pepito dismember of this this is an enzyme which is absent in at least a descent of the tappleton it is involved in the breakwaters and i know that millerites ed in this particular ensign
1268.97,1278.15, and i said that you could the patients for the sight of competitor you put the man to present however a
1278.3,1362.0, the evidence just isn't him afraid of the moment and this valuation was done by very respected organization in the united states the station for health re such polity and they went through all the data which is out in the literature and what they came up with wisconsin do we just don't have evidence at the moment to be able to say whether it helps or whether it hinders and so i'm not saying it doesn't help at all the way we need to do to do the right studies so compromise the evidence may othean introduce you into an ache in the best way possible so the patients benefit and the problem that we have with genetic tests a moment is that there isn't very much evidence for many genetic test with having offered to the public and there is a potential de maham the public and this is from science which is very suspected journal and from early this year and what they said was that to day there is no mechanism to ensure the genetic testard by adequate before the marketed or that any market in claims of the make are truthful and not misleading misleading claims about test may health care providers and patience to make inappropriate decisions about whether to test or how to interpret tereus and that racial iou that are so benefit harm a may be had by using the engineering properly and with desperate time to make sure that that doesn't happen in terms of the way we try to develop the evidence base
1362.18,1366.65, to conclude saracenic i think represents a powerful to
1366.68,1372.98, then improve the benefit harm balance associate with the drugs are used in the nats today
1373.1,1381.41, it is however only one of the many different matters that need to be so the developed and tested to be able to include patient care
1381.92,1397.1, any intervention peewits genetics aspect with his clinical it is important and there is a good evidence faces that you do not inadvertently harm your questions and this is what exactly we were in towards a thankfulness
1398.0,1425.75, i'm actually pushing for delaying test be bailable to every passion before they are prescribed psychotic drops the matter what drugs they are being prescribed and and i'm encouraging the nice guidelines to into the scrimmage tipping and understood that and leatht research was being done at
1425.84,1440.6, which she represents in a correct reweave been being an evaluation of satanity the sex with anti psychotic not unto the presents and sacristie
1440.63,1495.41, the work is going on at the moment and it is going to go to nice very soon so i can't i have the exact the final date to moment but but sailed and we worked on this for at least eighteen months really literature eating looking to every database we have every tricon act with such throughout the world to be able to get their data and then put it together to see whether there is a true benefit of two teetering before you go on to psychotics and as i said what we want to do is to make sure that the evidence bases there to italy helps to patient and at the moment all i can go in as by the evidence that oftentimes in much that the fat depreciative told me when my son wardresses available
1495.41,1524.81, having to pay for this test privately for more than ten pounds i do assure you that my son is a poor metabolize they waited six and an intermediate tabulated for the two sanine and he has erected very acutely and adversely to all the sight topelius and it is then that the gelatine pink tacitly should be made and to patience and cares awareness of this test can be bought up front
1525.59,1533.24, interestingly my interest in this field is due to my own experience of the prescribed several years ago
1533.33,1553.97, a couple of drugs latin so psychiatric medicine which caused adverse medical conditions and it's more of an observation one of the curious things that since i've been looking at and i would just be grateful for your swords and was blood grouping
1554.36,1556.43, something simple that
1556.49,1565.4, i just wonder if there is any substance in the concept that different blood groups have different blood
1565.52,1572.99, sanctions characteristics and relating to that it strikes me that body can istry
1573.02,1589.31, when i did my clinical disenfranchise many years ago it was rather striking particularly in the limbs how ammanato ical features vary enormously and when you think about it to have a variation in gene pool
1589.55,1600.83, quite logical because it does lead to diversity which is helpful for survival and in that way by a chemistry body chemistry metabolism
1600.89,1608.48, indecision it strikes me that its logical that there are variations in
1608.51,1612.59, sort of features like a witchmen
1612.83,1619.73, catou mentioned i think were bodies have variations in function
1620.24,1655.85, just grateful for your sort thank you so you you're quite right there is very ability and said there are cremiere apartment very tiamont us and in that does lead to variability in some anatomical structures variability in a bicetre very militarism very ability necetas are and so the decanting is trying to disentangle that and provide the evidence as toward genetic test i use you could say that you could go and do your whole human gnome let the moment that costly and the susan pounds for you and gene are we doing now how to interpret that
1655.88,1672.98, regard to the blood groups cleary patrols are important in etechemin which lucknow fouquet transfusion which which a blueish be given and under is evidence that our blood groups also determine our susceptibility to certain diseases such as malaria
1673.04,1697.91, but there is at the moment a parisian drugs which which which are a cushionless which poseidon a loose there is no evidence that in the determined responds to for example psychiatric drugs et cetera so but with the clearly the rommany different various on the blood cells surfaces which may impact on how well a red blooded work and so on and that decandolle to moan
1697.94,1703.16, charles charles made thank you for an interesting tool you
1703.67,1728.39, very persuasive evidence that genetic predisposition is going to influence responsible in the minority of people treated with drugs but have you made any estimate is possible to make any estimate of the total burden of it
1728.57,1730.73, medicines
1730.79,1733.4, certainly just begun
1733.43,1763.1, we all on the receiving end of mass marketing mass marketing techniques and there notified tests said the implicate i'm looking at the other side of the cone described and wondered if you could estimate how great the yearning burden might be from the lack of of investigating of genetic fact that lack of investigation of genetic factors in determining drug response and was your
1763.19,1781.61, that it is difficult to give an overall figure for the whole aseptic ailment harum that is available to the prescribing doctor because all drugs are handled differently in the body so but with for some drugs it may be a hundred per cent more of the sex is for some drugs may be less than five per cent
1781.61,1796.4, what a trying to do it the moment i try to get that kind of variability and estimate of the effect is within articulate group and there are various ways of doing and the loss of working on all round the world to be able to do that it has been said
1797.3,1824.84, the literature that may be at least certain percent of address a fact drugs could be prevented by genetics now that is an estimate and may be grossly wrong or may be costly i may be underestimating or overestimating so in terms of the whole are serpiente decease but within individual drug categories it could be handed percent in terms of preventing it or it could be could be as less than five the lesson five per cent
1827.69,1832.16, the court cateaton support group and i have a son
1832.31,1848.36, he had difficulties you were talking about the evidence base and that needed and i was particularly interested in the parties and the absolute in the general population polymorpha
1851.15,1855.83, some government design has done many many years six
1855.92,1874.46, years of intensive research into how environmental factors may or may not impact on people and particularly with regard to exposure to agricultural chemicals and a kind of states articular 
1875.06,1877.28, the results of that
1877.34,1879.8, search have been
1879.83,1891.77, by government when they come out or been slow in being released and i wondered if you are accepting some of the information one that came out
1892.52,1907.79, cherry was specifically about them sheep farmers who do and don't react and it was this pass way orthis mechanism that they were exploring and it found quite conclusively that there was considerable evidence that
1907.82,1918.95, that were affected by the chemicals did have this limitation in their bodies now residence and people in rural areas like myself
1919.1,1927.59, we are also being exposed in the same way as sheep farmers and my son was if elated 
1927.68,1943.19, the london school of identical medicine and tony lectureship study which was looking at sheep farmers lose an exposed and his school was far in excess of people who had been had an acute
1943.97,1960.02, a fact none of this was taken into account when he was given an easy not for mental health problems but for pacific physical health problems by the cup no history was taken and now if illation whatsoever was done
1960.02,1972.41, the impact of this drug keeping of to a sixteen year old in these difficult circumstances already had diagnoses of the severe form of a conic long term house condition
1973.19,1991.76, so with you got organ of positioning and galoubet exposure we are not ourselves doing any work on that but i know the orisa lot of work going on at the out at two or tendinous work
1993.11,2002.38, in terms of the relationship with the sight that i anaitis difficult for me to comment on individual cases and so on and a happy to discuss with your coffee
2002.38,2028.39, a possible link and so on but the organ of polite of istar very complicated chemicals which undergo different pathways there may be some overlap and pathways and were of open pathways has any relevance or at all has been investigated it is unclear at the moment and what that tootles ating there is more work that this new to be done in the kind of a
2030.04,2054.25, a really pleased that your own doing research or more french is pretty straightforward with him the two polymathers i think sittings of bit more problematical because most of them go through two d six and libertine ten in the two sanine and but i think it could be dangerous as you said if you get a negative for any polymetis on those
2054.82,2064.78, people fish is the genipi test for for example the seton and transported gene and how good we
2065.08,2153.28, tannhaeuser with that be okay so so you're quite so i haven't shown you all the days of alternate nine insincere or from so i just showed you to be so but an unique recounted depress and there are no the polities to sanine to initiate a fourth five at secreto these but there are also the tramcars to five agitated to fiercest etcetera nor generosities which all very important the what what the problem is an andersson is an important are to study with gattonside to them the world he might be some genetic factors but i just don't have evidence pastel you confidently that those genetic have to surefooted and the need to be funding for this is to do the studies to the witan loathest sanine with an look at the five itacoatiara five attentions and put the motet and look at interaction between them so that we can develop those kind of methods so that we can treat patients with depression with the appropriate drug at the right thereof the dietitians so you know you that is valuable for me to come here and listen to me listen to patience ruination etcetera telling me they have the side effects of it you know i can then devour and say well you do need funding for this we do need to take this further forward so that we can develop the prophetess to help patient
