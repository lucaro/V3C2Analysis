462.39,493.5, he necessitated the sooner
493.56,645.51, jesus staatsschreiber teetotallers
650.55,657.51, after this jesus went across the sea of galilee that is the sea of papirius
657.93,660.51, a large crowd followed him
660.6,664.71, they had seen the miraculous signs he had done among the sick
665.46,669.06, he went up the mountain and sat there with his disciples
669.84,672.36, it was nearly time for passover
672.63,674.1, west
675.12,679.71, so up and saw the large crowd coming towards him
680.28,681.6, i
682.38,685.68, will we buy food to feed these people
686.19,688.77, at this the test him
689.25,692.46, he already knew what he was going to do
693.39,694.89, replied
695.34,702.87, more than a half year's salary or of food what i'd be enough for each person to have even a little bit
704.1,706.65, his disciples andrew
707.31,709.38, and peter's brother said
710.13,714.96, you here has five darlings and two fish
715.44,718.74, good is that for a crowd like this
719.97,721.26, he said
721.8,723.72, the people sat down
723.93,726.54, there was plenty of grass there
726.96,730.11, down about five thousand of them
730.44,732.27, jesus took the bread
732.69,734.34, he had given thanks
734.61,737.37, distributed to those who were sitting there
737.79,739.95, did the same with the fish
740.16,742.47, getting as much as they wanted
742.92,745.02, when they had had plenty to eat
745.08,746.67, said to his disciples
747.63,749.7, the left over pieces
749.85,752.04, that nothing will be wasted
753.03,759.03, i gathered them and fill baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves
759.18,760.8, been left over
760.86,762.42, those who had eaten
763.56,768.48, the people saw that he had done on the crapulous sign they said
768.48,772.35, truly the prophet whose coming into the world
773.13,779.22, he understood that they were about to come and force him to be their king
779.64,783.72, took refuge again alone on the mountain
786.06,793.89, to day's story is one of the miracles stories from the gospels
794.73,800.82, be sure the word miracle occurs in the bible to describe when glad steps in
800.85,804.66, something which is not according to the natural order
805.74,808.98, god supercedes natural law
809.61,813.87, that happens when god makes the day last longer and joshua ten
813.93,822.84, happens again when god made the shadow of the sun stay on the stairs longer than it usually did and i say a thirty nine and forty
823.41,826.83, happened when jesus turned water into wine at cana
827.55,828.75, frankly
829.17,837.93, every time it happens every time the bible talks about it it makes self oaks with modern sensibilities kind of uncomfortable
837.96,840.15, explanation that i remember
840.36,843.87, from lane back when i was in sunday school
844.32,846.0, something like this
846.93,849.54, what happened on that day on the hill
851.1,852.72, greater miracle
853.8,858.0, a miracle people's minds and hearts being changed
858.75,860.64, what happened was
861.51,864.84, a lot of folks actually brought stuff with them at
865.53,866.52, and
866.91,869.16, in keeping it to themselves
870.39,873.3, people saw the generosity of the ugly
873.45,875.55, conscious were pricked
876.12,878.58, and they put away their selfishness
879.24,881.1, open their supplies
882.21,883.53, and then the
883.86,884.7, as
884.97,888.18, so much more that after all the people had eaten
888.9,890.73, there was a whole bunch left over
891.96,895.95, moral history is well shouldn't we saw on our hearts
896.1,897.66, give up we have
897.93,900.87, will be amazed at the excess
901.2,902.16, we do
902.28,907.62, that god sometimes does rely on us
907.8,909.3, make things happen
910.35,913.68, a lot of things that will only happen in this world
914.13,916.2, we pick up draws a gent
917.52,918.78, at
919.77,921.96, amazing things the church
921.99,923.07, do
923.67,927.3, we combined our seemingly small resources
928.44,930.09, what we have
930.6,933.18, merpeople ely inadequate
934.02,936.27, we let god use it
937.68,940.77, our modern minds are comfortable with
941.28,942.6, she
942.93,945.21, the divinity of christ
945.27,948.27, acts of god that are taking place
950.7,958.02, in the end it's about some sensibilities it's about what god is doing in our world
958.59,961.68, about focusing not just on the reasonable
962.07,964.02, the basic needs
966.12,967.41, probability
968.58,970.35, possibility
970.41,972.33, multiplying resources
972.51,975.3, we might experience a revelation
975.39,977.31, amazing grace
978.63,981.51, means and methods are really important
982.02,983.43, important
985.41,989.01, god will supply all your need
989.85,996.42, not only just as much as you need but far more than you can even imagine or ask for or
996.45,999.06, conceive of as pauses
999.15,1000.38, the
1003.38,1006.05, just as we should not under play
1006.56,1008.36, as in the story
1008.42,1014.15, not understate the motivations of jesus is kind of tempting to read this story
1014.42,1016.61, an example of jesus compassion
1017.39,1021.11, then it has a feeling of communion kind of added the end for added benefit
1021.5,1026.42, takes the bread and gives thanks and breaks it and distribute it among the tipple
1027.74,1029.75, not that those elements aren't there
1030.41,1033.26, that they are so much more there
1033.35,1034.43, from 
1035.09,1039.41, john draws all kinds of traditions from his people
1039.77,1043.1, in order to connect these things to the larger story of god
1043.73,1045.44, feeding the hungry minutes
1046.22,1048.35, patrol water
1048.95,1054.77, sounds kind of familiar and if you read through exodus moses face some similar problems
1055.37,1060.83, in the wilderness he asked god where am i glad to get me to feed all these people
1061.91,1066.11, exodus memories are memories of liberation and freedom
1066.68,1069.26, i promise and new life
1069.89,1073.85, the story also can act with other old testament stories as well
1073.88,1076.73, example someone looking at the
1078.71,1080.93, inexplicably multiplied
1082.19,1085.28, in time of the story of the lecture
1085.58,1087.17, second kings to
1087.92,1090.89, connections all throughout the old testament
1092.0,1096.56, john connect jesus with all the prophets of god before him
1098.78,1100.04, ironically
1100.37,1102.14, of the people
1103.94,1105.68, for freedom
1105.68,1110.78, the empire that oppresses them leads them to set their sights too short
1111.98,1113.42, certainly understandable
1113.81,1114.77, human
1115.16,1119.3, they would see jesus the miracle worker as a potential king
1119.96,1121.94, desire for a king however
1122.27,1124.52, too small a dream
1125.48,1128.6, short of god stream for god's people
1129.2,1132.65, not looking to simply trade one ruler
1132.74,1134.09, for another
1135.71,1138.53, looking not to rule nations
1138.65,1140.21, that
1141.41,1142.76, be careful
1145.28,1149.09, our short stones confused what we think we need
1149.72,1151.22, what we really need
1152.33,1155.87, not allow god to provide what god knows
1156.08,1157.67, actually
1158.9,1162.41, what this miracle worker can do for us
1162.47,1164.99, see the reality of grace
1165.74,1168.32, it seeks to make jesus into a genie
1170.87,1174.77, he wants to give us what we don't even realize we need yet
1176.0,1177.56, let consciously
1180.71,1185.72, what we need deep down in our innermost authentic human selves
1187.25,1189.23, that's why in the end
1189.38,1192.95, story is not just about providing food
1193.79,1195.23, grace
1195.26,1201.41, about abundance it's about abundant living in every way in everything
1203.99,1205.7, he asked
1206.33,1207.41, two little
1208.37,1210.62, can give us so much more
1211.76,1215.72, we see the andromeda lots and expectations
1218.12,1220.4, elsewhere begin to see
1220.52,1222.29, is leaving us
1223.4,1225.98, wants to take the five loaves
1226.19,1231.86, two fishes of our lives and infuse them with the power of the holy spirit
1232.52,1234.92, plying them far beyond
1234.98,1237.44, even hope for or imagine
1239.66,1240.92, close
1241.13,1242.27, he
1242.54,1248.03, nurture until such things like feeding five thousand people are so commonplace
1248.12,1252.05, cause we're experiencing miracles on such a greater scale
1255.41,1257.42, simplicity in itself
1259.97,1262.85, that when the realm of god has come in full
1264.29,1266.0, a long way to go he
1267.68,1268.82, friends
1269.6,1271.13, your hearts
1271.49,1273.65, our minds the possibility
1274.25,1276.32, power of guard for through
1277.28,1280.85, you will see a multiplication of resources
1281.03,1282.5, nothing short
1282.83,1284.33, the miraculous
1287.6,1319.34, heretofore
1319.76,1349.91, stealthily
1350.33,1358.19, the man
1358.34,1417.59, he aeternitatis
1419.45,1439.52, we come together to day to celebrate a very special meal it's the meal at the lord's table where all are welcomed wherever in the world where from wherever in the world were going all who seek to know god better through christ are invited to this table we

1508.91,1510.68, the bread from the table
1511.1,1512.9, he gave thanks for it
1513.11,1514.64, blessed it
1515.24,1516.53, he broke in
1517.46,1524.9, gave it to his friends whose disciples saying take and this is my body of the covenant broken for you
1525.11,1527.39, do this in remembrance of me
1528.53,1541.73, in the same way when the supper was over he took the cup from the table he gave thanks and blessed it and he gave it to his disciples and said drink from this olive you this is my blood of the covenant poured out for you and for many
1541.73,1545.39, do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
1546.05,1553.22, often as we eat of this bread and drink of this cup we proclaim his life his death and his resurrection as he comes again

1643.43,1646.04, use every day
1646.13,1647.36, every moment
