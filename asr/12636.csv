2.58,19.92, a grand from blackladies in and would like to say what we got near this notissima say unilateral is sheer with grandeur and new rodamonte view some new converters egocentric and new cameras and the vitiated harassing 
19.95,22.05, just a quiet and software
22.05,33.12, the other night the amazing fusion saltwhite was used on oratorically the ansidei more and let the moment but first i love to start with the new motive
33.21,39.87, we have what's really exciting about this multi dios it's got in imports of course but it's already
39.87,43.62, you know always big screens in the stores that you can go and get
43.71,55.05, it consumes a blind you can now use for malting double resolution and double the shapes of all views as pale what's also good about the motives it got sixteen different imports economy different
55.08,61.53, and so you have you know standardisation of estate agent all tried
61.56,66.42, coming at the same time and also work because he is like an independent little marguerite
66.54,72.96, it configuration crying between for nine or sixteen years at some time
73.02,76.95, you can also read any of the source views to any of the
77.19,95.16, ay the sources to any the views which is really flexible as if you were running at anasarca or you might be running a bunch of those you might want t have a club but of incoming camera feeds in one area and a bunch of you know worcestershire she inornate away as you want but on his you denis had got round the back and put me in putting
95.49,125.91, and it works very much like a rat if you look at the front panel he can say there's little screen there and the spinnet and you also got a button had so that works a man named you as looking on the screen at the layout screen but you can also run the same as a rare or anything get the sauce and a destination but the destination is not called us passions called view and disruptors and has a salivating and push that if i just one look at one view and it also it runs on eventuate back arundinacea which means i can use any very up control panels and control of wildfoot
125.97,137.37, and it's going to be available in november and we think it's pretty song i can say some without a fire but being used in the most control situation and you can say the
137.43,144.93, but in front of the dish they have custom control over it but of course he could mount the unity behind the monitorial control values in it if you like
144.99,148.53, the next forty can say a thing is the more my ball
148.56,195.27, then i can say that he eventually be to mandalay sixteen going in adamant it small enough to be you know bellowed in a van or doesn't matter whether you running is to hochelaga work as every import six guest and now in a different feofar get our landing liberating get a lot of from ted's coming in and then let every amputating a recent just takes carville sadgrove and you can see the ergotin in the back a little tiny car he a got it of people doing production ever other small molecules things so you know his surprise number differentiations these cones are protinus i think it's very exciting and then he has pretty signing to build on the dietitians by walpole to make one i am not really great one here in the next line would like to talk about is really fantastic altogether on a wild with made full resolution altamore on so that panel in the front there is
195.33,196.89, i tried a
197.22,203.16, the other thing is exciting is its digestion so he can run twenty one sixty p sixty
204.51,224.49, i really am i using it may that man signorina camera and you can say for it on in oltrarno in estancias well an automatically switches and it uses turnips in the skyline a rollicking image i mean the picture quality so high i mean i jocoseria omen cause can bump your head into because you think it's reality like a reachin
224.52,225.9, you know
225.9,236.52, you can also say it's a machine metal is an i've got a earliness madelon but a control panel in the front was some control so conflict the impudent
236.55,244.44, the controls like that but we also put in hispaniola cast molestation as renascent the sea was in the banking and the colossal
244.53,250.71, digital the banking tesselated off but with god that in the southing that's a little retribution
250.74,253.98, look up tables and that people native look up tables and
254.01,262.14, the entire tables and cannibalism front panel the blow only and i was also some frame guides can adjust itself as well
262.14,265.26, if you look at the back panel you can say that
265.32,271.56, i think that my saviour thing is the amount in on the back of the whole chain the back section metal but there's a
271.56,278.97, calling the back there but the invasion of sedulous articulated arms and you know so newsrooms and other situations like that
279.09,281.31, some of the connectors
281.43,282.81, what got
282.87,303.78, i say power which is built in a magtaca and put as well he can notionate i've got patinated he can sentimental you allus from machines competed but got two twelve vegetation switch before them and they decided to hear and as a torvestad what have i put you got slight to then comes out the auto
303.81,332.85, i farther coeslin optical falealili if you want to an optical father striketh one with farthest twelve guests think that's a bit more important because people running along the lane and you know you got the bit put an optical father madeline at the moment her toledot fatheads exist but when i do implied those impatient siegfried as a electorate as well as i think you know it is a beautiful little monitor is going to be one no one and will be valuable december one to get the panels
332.91,337.77, it's brought beautiful and it's pretty much the edible that any vidsender we can think of
337.83,340.02, i thought over her being used
340.05,350.97, what would don also if you look at the audient fight a blowin an edison homecomer then they sort of design they got together and he can see the werther's also of
351.06,357.42, come down into the front of the holders they looked at together it was a combination
357.54,362.28, would pretty impression pretty sodalities really pretty started the auto on it's going to
362.28,373.08, constable next up i'd love to talk about this radiation were folly about fortysix bigger edgartown and twenty or
373.14,378.36, we introduced some igdrasil and but 
378.39,383.52, this this is a boy much larger one with double to reckon and and as
384.57,394.71, it has done penance so control panels the front of the other you know it's machine metal i mean see what a plugged in the back ternissa allowable will pianolas were using it to drive the malted
394.74,400.38, but just look at the left of the image and say just down here there's some redundant palapye he got the two towropes
400.47,402.39, the 
402.9,414.06, it runs all the time protocols as the lords so beautiful big machine metal front and it's also got a much larger and ran on this he can do some really big libels and i'd look for the claim and when you
414.09,417.72, in the pitch of the can see them you know magisterially really cleanliness
417.72,420.54, i used wagons that
420.54,428.55, it's going the visual rodin way can stroll the northern really scatteration which can see the before sources that strolling through so
428.61,436.08, a really easy white arab causes this look at the solacing through and you got sense libels and on this molestation
436.23,443.76, i think that's exciting that tonneau that'll be shipping in well next month which is out
444.06,463.98, now the next step is you know a few plain aviland if he is the soft water set up ideas would not have said no arisaig primitive the selford howbeit we built that self raise we didn't have to idea i saw his room substitute configurated saw his rattish but it's also getting a bit pale looking and so we really wanted to replace that
463.98,468.27, got on line to day which you can dawnlight video hub round
468.27,478.74, new sware so you can go on down by the blackmailer six point one and it gives you what is stonehaven the two
478.77,489.96, really uses for that sulphurous it was controlling the rout and setting up the libels in the raturan him in two different applications as black vendangeuses up which is now used the sanities and setting up the route
489.99,498.75, this blackpool which is the control panel self with it he can give to all the people and you facility and i can use that to control from maidos machine
498.78,501.24, from the desolate
501.27,508.92, one about the desolate to give you criterion of how that what it looks like and how it works so if you have a lot of computer screen here contrary
509.76,514.35, about the two selection of sound like mending the uncontrol and black magic blamed up
514.47,520.74, run the black button and that gives me a look control of the route sincerely souls here
520.83,533.58, i give this offer can get everybody in facility so you know you every one has got a computer that's connected into the network and take this utility and they can control around but as no whitewashes a certain yereself used for that
533.67,535.5, this quite noses
535.5,538.92, come the sidontans and here and
538.92,540.96, on a button in his coat it
540.99,544.35, trying to this vile truck i can
544.38,547.17, don and i now got you know
547.35,550.53, nations here so it's quite an 
550.86,556.23, looking at it it supports the renegades on metastasis very beautifully shop
556.29,562.83, you are and you can also change the size of the window changed any size i can get a full spring no
562.92,566.1, if spreads he can even use touch screen computers
566.1,568.98, it was well to trygstand
569.01,570.3, the sauce for that
570.54,581.88, that's the control utility and if you want to change any the settings in the radish as libels on come into the viability or the set utility and conceive here is found the violin the folly before you go the rakaia
581.97,583.08, on that
583.11,585.66, abel changes i can make
585.75,587.7, that multi
587.91,593.76, on the output which have got coming in here when salicetti as well i can say this quite setting her
593.79,597.18, it's very easy to set up the radio when you're
597.84,607.38, using a vidette sofas available now so definitely recommend domain and storing it because it supports all ideas and i think it's quite a big improvement
607.92,611.1, so that's that so the next
611.16,620.1, talk about as we've got some new micantes this is stirred to know we upgrade a bunch of ammonites and nan
620.1,627.72, i continued to roll out you know new models of all tiedemann tousled the history 
627.75,635.82, and switched on instantly the good thing about them is that that rains with pretty much done all rangement is now
635.82,639.57, all banal tried to models for came all
639.66,648.81, so you know that's not at the complete ryan is ready for the future and i you know my writing altogether as it and storing for medical got better cuthbert
648.84,666.81, on some heavy duty versions of these were got out to every unconverted are tough machine mental cases and everyone here with cars we even run over a part some of these composed with a sincerity survived and kept working while we did that we cristatus really well evenson with how strong my work
666.87,673.77, the production escosura and really protected the connectors well as well also the heavy demands 
673.8,681.12, you'll be available at the odious are available now but he has one will be available next month and there on
681.15,687.09, and there are available in the estimation and the estate analog
688.17,689.55, pretty exciting
689.73,705.96, the next thing i got to talk about is to be in the resolve with but a new version of the future is all which were posted on fredoniad sir resolve even point one and i were really done with this version of resolve the etablie things been quite at the time to do in the original to entresol eleven release
705.96,716.25, what of potassa things now safely obvious but but there corporate and some of them have come back a feedback to us what people like undishonored this way on the shed work their way so
716.25,721.59, people you know tell us you know with doneraile in ready for the next race
721.59,724.83, the shawanoe locative look at
725.1,728.58, others and i'll run it now
729.84,732.84, the time line and
732.87,736.11, panther are got myself a time one
738.78,753.78, one of the slips and reining up in the viand one of the new states is like in just the inanities and if your ainsel anither time one or the other thing is in here is also a captain so antunano be someways i treacle which has come nice
753.9,768.15, also one thing i'm not doing here i've got a single screen running here so if you're running your wonderstone fate can bring this him on up full grown but it's available and morose up but i'm just running a single mather so that's kind of nice if you really need to get into the time i get into the lies
768.21,770.67, another feature is model
770.76,774.12, it is sentimentality coupled cliffs and
774.21,777.99, command to and so the alteration of the multiple at a point
777.99,780.45, that sort doesn't stay there
780.54,785.82, the other thing i can do is if you drag a follerin vide mediation
785.85,795.96, before us the cause to lie of hierarchy but it keeps all the falls in the rain so the foreshore fall into a follower it'll capella in the right irate which is a really useful thing of course
796.02,805.02, one of the attaches were got into penetrates so shy that lingereth terraces here and change its hard in a penalty the other tracks but can be released forces
805.05,811.38, protracts i can also come down if you notice like a come down into now and and bland in idiotic
811.41,815.19, for being a video tattoo on one i can kind of blame it in
815.28,824.01, the idea it sent like a cross fire but really in the blending was on in an air point you could do that in the auditing the video tricks as well
824.01,827.88, the fates were it really quite like his he swapped
827.97,829.89, tonnage
830.01,843.9, clipped down easters and tattheration the same so it's quite a really nice little features in this relates available now for our website so please it down idea said cadogan invite divitias off light forth is the free version and the full version
844.11,850.11, next stop we need a really powerful cathcart work with the tantricas it's doing high friaries hirsutus
850.11,852.75, infuriate
852.75,854.37, he is sitting on the bench
854.7,861.99, the saying a pretty much to say to the guiana as is good for it we want to make sure we've got to callander thing we want to do and really in my doesn't matter what the process
862.14,869.82, luckily it was commented on sentiero which pretty impressed about cousin but really just wanted to put everything that we possibly could
869.82,873.93, the exotic thing about it telling test
873.93,878.58, means that i can do two streams of alta
878.61,885.3, at the sign in now you know that three day where you want to do any know jewel channels in 
885.3,895.38, but also he running fiancee on a felt like a most worsening a card with one twelve years i connection what we really one of us too so he do things like silence
895.38,917.28, the sin time all the day now attend it with god and much fast a piece o expressing the potsdamer this alan gently hexpress forties faster than the fort and one of the other things that's got all the same featherstone dealing forecasted cards so that's not because he mentioned and longing and a hastening and out i mean it's got on long and digital you know dionetta
917.43,925.23, a nervously dueling told tenant so it's got a lot of you know locations in and out so pretty much take her to nictitating
925.23,931.23, the other difference between this and the other you know the delicate tramcar as the scotsman the side
931.35,936.48, men down as a reason what do that is let us say a higher and its 
936.6,947.73, there was a hissing my socks and that kind of an exciting thing because mansoor the optical fire sofas catinari farmerette card itself directly to atone future
947.73,958.92, support to stop the models for the moment i don't exert that as they come available anyone putting a put a six to october modulation
959.13,962.94, now that's too local modules because obviously it's dueling and not
963.0,980.31, i think this will be a gain important if you know you're on roostem and you want to sort of run around you know years to asinine future he kind of want to know you've got something you can operate and so of moved optical fire get some certainly on table latinity if you on the edge of the table lansdowne distances boiler
980.34,983.13, terence up riding
983.16,986.34, and points and the optical farther table itself is the sign
986.58,992.19, so i think that's a really great product that's one and it'll be available in october
992.91,995.16, i've got some new cameras
995.46,999.03, now one way originally designed like continence
999.03,1005.84, a peasant who was really such a you know you know the quane av judy kind of design and
1005.99,1017.45, for that as originally it was paine is on as a pale man camera and we realized how it three to development that we really probably need to use as monopolies catilines cause we found a lot of people would be using his camera that we deal
1017.45,1023.96, i was designed to be you know sort of a bed of the recording nortonia film recording
1025.01,1032.27, so we change the man lensmand we've gone a come back to the original you know concept and put the palmetto
1033.44,1035.96, beautiful minstrel
1036.38,1040.43, strong lens mount i mean if i take off the landscape can say
1040.52,1042.92, machine steel so it's might out of
1043.19,1055.91, stella's not aluminum which means a coffin a bid on the lands which are one of you knows that epistome pouring a bathos around the france that whole front ring comes off and you can chimaeras
1055.97,1073.7, and then scrub back on so you can call him it the lands to the camera and get a simeon's perfectly alone to the great thing about pelman lenses a course as the doors vintage glassite decides can he want to shoot something for the odes or seventies or sixty cause she can obviously though the old answers can get pale man modified
1073.88,1080.18, pretty much go back and read the lines that they used and i issues that was done on the sixties seventies
1080.18,1083.63, you know i can use that glass on the chart cameras
1083.63,1087.83, it's really in it a beautiful beautiful machines metal
1087.95,1093.41, strong i've got this ridiculously heavy an atlanta things i didn't pound or
1093.5,1095.03, i think it's
1095.27,1105.65, and i can do as you that on the front of the camera has got easily enough strength but as a whole design i in all this machine out of salem a woman in so
1105.65,1110.6, an extremely tough soldiers'll mount this lens on his own see argos on
1110.9,1114.38, the sniping tantaran he can
1114.56,1116.45, mounted on a 
1116.63,1121.01, then the camera up there is
1121.37,1134.9, you know it as has the strength to hold this massive lines and it's a very heavy lands again noineteen get that star on the the great thing about these old lands as the materials they used in the class and the collings and stuff you know
1135.02,1147.02, the white aladdin eras with elements and everything in monetary can't you know as sly reproduced that you know you know software anjitsu nosing it to get back in time and just put the very lands on the use and sedition
1147.17,1148.49, it's
1148.67,1151.01, very tough you know it's really quite a strong
1151.01,1153.14, which is important when he
1153.38,1160.94, these comers are being used to be used to it you know or sort of situations in you know very small you know kind of way get realmont and things to support the land so
1160.97,1162.68, a beautiful tough
1163.01,1167.18, i think what's also exciting as i think the mount itself looks better i think it's 
1167.33,1174.32, you know it's sort o i think it's well balanced you know it's not to say that original design that we originally imagined you know is a product
1174.95,1184.4, for this you know this but models of the black magic production camera for cap and also at the associational banister
1184.52,1186.71, he got the pale man
1186.77,1199.49, and it means what go now five models she really go to rangoon choose point and senses and three different lines mounts so you see we've got the fore causative salival shortens or if you want a
1199.55,1204.2, generally resolution with twelve substance
1204.2,1210.5, you want better for one and you want to board on a grange and were the beautiful not an ace sense
1210.59,1219.74, and you got near the crispin paleness and a course on the small santiago the marked so as to redecoration with his can pretty much choose
1219.8,1223.94, man and sensation in what you doing and so i think it's really not
1223.97,1224.96, choice
1225.05,1240.35, you can say you know the great thing about this is a thing so strong and so small and now the professional rely professional ends mantineans the soothings of people doing within the tither you know i've seen racey sansome photo four of our cameras on one cringed at the same time a man assist
1240.47,1243.41, been very sounding watching the consenting people have been doing
1243.41,1255.02, if an export of the gentlest out here really i think what the cameras original spirit of it was about as you know very handhold very portable and hotellerie them up heavily but we've got a certain solace as now
1255.08,1257.39, it's great to say you know
1257.66,1269.0, the cheers of the need in catholicons of really the locations we couldn't get a large camera and of course the cord got was a man funny to see the venturous and stropped out of the sky and
1269.03,1277.97, smashed the lands in the cocotte came at working it was pretty cool to say that because we really did desire to be that strong but i someway feel i would never rely had the vantage of
1277.97,1282.08, betaketh advantage of such to you know really over engineered by
1282.08,1289.01, until now it's really a flatters a gradely bounced products they are westinghouse now on their available the
1289.01,1297.59, other production cheerful as the sign crosses the canteen camera voisins take out what sort of the process
1297.77,1303.35, so we think that's really counting its like people really do you know keep doing some of the icing work with 
1303.44,1308.81, the next step the really the last big thing i want to talk about it that you know just a quiet lonely
1309.17,1318.77, i mean he might fusion you know the tsinsar and it's incredible i mean the number finally wood movies that he used with the same got a lodge in some of those
1318.77,1320.6, movies i mean it really just
1320.6,1322.19, incredible
1322.22,1328.28, it's a slatelike italianate secret of all i would you know in hollywood booking the
1328.52,1336.17, saranoff and i mean it really is quite incredible and it would very excited to be you know part of that and really to have this
1336.17,1348.08, like magic now of course we can improve the support we can grow the engineering times and do all more whether it's i think it's going to be very exciting what i've got is actually got the pioneers i'd love to show you just quickly
1348.2,1351.05, running and so
1352.04,1361.25, so that is running now i actually running about mackintavers machine so it's pretty little quintan it would not be defining on the windows mechanitis windows night of binocular
1361.58,1371.57, what's really funny i think about fusion as when you first look at it here you sailors nods and it looks pretty complicated in fact looked like a circuit board i mean first in anything while this is complicated but
1371.63,1392.99, think what's interesting as if he had any experience in editing wounds time on before and alopecia with time lines he realized that now when you have a couple of clips to a time in the end a couple of fixed to each lip and an you got no houplines age affect and you start to do anything complex really anything it with a couple more more than a couple of clips the contacting really busy very quickly and he spent half time never going around trying it
1392.99,1404.69, that age on the clinker is that exactly you know what's liaison effect is an inn where i just the ornytus a night the effect of the other things that i want to make and i can get quite complex i mean
1404.69,1430.04, some of the features where they've instated in the resolve whatever window support for the time line and you know terrable track yanaki sort of navigation the ways and i think the thing i find exciting about no is that what of essentially as belike equipment here you know it's buttings together you get you know that thing and you loggetta thing and the video custom that thing to that thing so i think if you have an experience now before i mean if you're an experience to fix gorgon to think what he talking about but
