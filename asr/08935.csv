7.86,9.18, the
13.41,15.54, he came from that
20.55,22.74, want
24.39,26.7, a
31.98,33.27, be on
33.6,35.82, angrily
36.69,39.57, the keeping it simple
41.25,43.56, i like the
43.8,45.45, in
45.63,47.58, but it's sort of in a way like
47.61,50.22, the baptist church is like
50.43,52.26, really ornate
52.29,53.61, really old
53.7,55.05, beautiful
55.2,60.93, the house of mercy just like renaissance that's what i like about it
62.1,64.56, the church too like its
65.73,69.81, there seemed to be really simple and the present it in such a way that
70.74,78.24, seems i take it more harmattan lakelike acquire singing it's just like some guys with
83.67,86.52, since disinterred
112.02,118.89, thinking a lot about them was the swedish one year person and like the flashes of
118.92,120.78, jesus getting is
121.65,124.56, how do you think that really fit in to
125.19,128.16, i know i am trying
128.4,129.63, but it 
131.07,134.25, i feel like just because the woman the actress lizabeth
136.35,137.52, he
139.56,141.63, the nurse was telling her
141.72,145.08, at herself you know about elizabeth she was saying like you
146.25,151.26, a pregnant like someone said the only thing he missing now because your perfect was motherhood
151.56,153.81, but it became pregnant
155.4,158.91, what because you didn't want to be pregnant and then you just kept
158.94,160.05, that
160.23,161.25, and
162.48,166.17, playing a part of the expectant mother
167.7,170.1, your son was born you hated him
170.16,172.29, we wanted the child dead
172.32,174.09, like she was just
175.2,179.19, against life so much you know just like hating life
179.28,185.1, like the ultimate gift you know it's like the first part of the ultimate gift you know
185.22,187.59, the parts and that the first part
191.34,193.56, sustaining it so much
194.22,195.42, i think 
195.63,202.32, the idea of jesus living for that one purpose only to like being able to make people's lives better
202.89,204.42, and to be there
204.45,206.61, it became too happen
206.73,214.41, like she was just an get so much and like it showed like no other image besides like the tale going through his hand
214.47,216.9, now just like a really quickly
217.23,220.86, all these like flashes of men as before you know
222.54,229.53, things like you know the skeleton to do so ethereal a skeleton like a man yelling and then like
229.86,231.66, through his hand
231.84,233.19, just like
234.72,240.27, paraffin she was suffering because she liked she would
240.75,243.09, and she wanted to be let the world but
244.23,245.61, it was her own
245.91,251.79, my insistent such men but she chose to
253.29,256.53, after the coffee or love
256.89,260.61, after religion or her spirit or soul
260.73,261.87, like
261.87,265.32, the sense that like all brought up with
265.38,267.78, you know it's inherent and as
268.83,269.58, to
269.73,271.05, that is
272.58,275.82, in compassion and thirty you know
276.03,278.22, like justinian
278.22,279.69, her suffering
279.84,287.4, she wanted to be out of the world but not enough that she would commit suicide or just enough that she would stop talking
287.46,289.8, what happened over a into any one
290.85,292.62, she also liked
293.1,295.26, the care of her to
295.35,301.08, feeling alike nurse when she really didn't
301.47,303.72, i could see you like
304.74,307.44, hepatitis having 
308.04,312.99, like she never expected 
316.71,322.29, characters extremely interesting series the movie basically
322.89,324.99, it almost seemed to be a little
326.79,329.79, a man but early she seemed
330.3,337.56, really crinoline did say was changed in her life she was so doubtless stuff and that 
337.95,339.75, anyway
343.89,346.38, i think of you and i let
351.42,356.82, extreme differences in the two characters and like the attendant with things
359.76,361.26, they were
361.38,362.58, how
364.32,367.44, got on well as because they just sort of had to
367.56,371.58, that seemed like there both early jauntily
371.61,375.03, yes really done towards the son
375.12,377.61, as to eatin
378.51,384.0, i was expecting the weather way and now it was religion
450.36,452.64, he
489.75,490.71, he
495.27,515.13, i misconception though some sitting in her serene
524.61,532.5, but the ear
539.31,551.88, i oratorical
557.16,566.52, operations
574.17,588.66, he aheethanaran soared
590.82,597.06, i want to go to her and withstood
597.81,603.72, before
603.72,612.63, at that he feel like nothing like that can be ignored because 
612.72,619.89, the flaunting the forbearance dreams
620.16,637.83, paranomasie no one elemental a dream to really understand what you talking about it that's not really papa
638.67,650.4, oatmeal and i heard that other stream about falling out like some thirteen footing to
651.09,659.46, escape and trying to see father
662.22,665.1, i treat my family
669.93,699.63, but my mother telling my sister to give her to give me a herculean i should have a long black coat yesterday mother asked a her cotton it was meant for me she was packing her give me your coat
700.62,710.94, the oranienburger 
713.67,718.74, roared
719.49,720.09, he
720.54,724.68, aimeri
729.69,732.63, you terrify
739.53,757.95, boisterous ing became like every other interest sort of different starting with
759.87,777.54, another oasis and marthe were alone
777.54,783.12, sansome more severe than others
783.93,785.01, even
786.39,789.96, married husband joseph thought that she was lying
790.32,792.12, at that
792.21,794.91, she had become pregnant and sealing
795.57,804.18, but being in a macular conception i think it doesn't really matter
806.43,807.78, i think she
809.97,811.56, people who need her
811.98,813.6, a polite any 
813.6,816.63, religious figure exists
816.78,819.78, she is for
821.64,823.29, women i think
824.64,825.75, women
827.1,828.99, a figure like that
829.92,834.6, think it's catholicism strong points the fact that they have
836.04,837.6, important 
838.32,839.85, female figure
841.62,844.38, a true saint in a woman
847.5,855.63, most of the women who are saying sir mythical i think there are stories of girls
855.72,865.92, buildings to preserve their virginity when being pursued isolier i think mary is just one of those
869.55,872.94, a dramatic speech once
874.14,876.06, the perspective of mary
876.21,879.42, really realize who it was until
879.42,880.35, and
880.41,882.15, the speech but she
883.92,885.84, her perspective
887.22,897.81, of being the mother of jesus and he denied her at one point like she was there when he was crucified but
898.05,899.88, denied her he said
899.88,902.16, my mother and who is my father
902.58,903.42, as
904.38,907.05, understood that it really wasn't
907.35,910.5, like his existence wasn't
911.49,915.36, from a family it didn't come from his father and his mother
915.84,917.07, on earth
917.73,919.68, not like he didn't love them but
921.36,923.67, that he had her there saying that
925.02,927.9, she was pursuing him with a crowd of people
929.67,932.22, left nazareth and
934.05,936.96, telling him that he was crazy
937.2,946.47, and that he would never succeed in spreading the word of god the way that he wanted to because he was breaking all of the rules that had been set up by the old testament
948.48,956.4, mary called jesus her son and told him to come back home to his mother and he said who is my mother
956.58,957.84, my father
959.79,961.35, the same thing
961.53,963.39, here as in the temple
964.14,965.79, you like 
966.12,967.95, years old and
970.47,974.55, it was one marranos lost him they went into the city and
974.61,978.54, and then they went back and realized that he was gone
978.93,980.73, they went back to the city
981.42,984.99, for they found him in the temple and he was surrounded by
985.47,990.69, priestcraft and scribes and doctors and he was lecturing to them
990.9,996.48, but it's not even so much like as securing to them like that's the most basic betrayal but
998.04,1001.7, seen others that i find far more agreeable
1002.51,1004.31, him just talking
1004.37,1008.42, people saying but what about this and him saying well this is this
1008.66,1011.03, people just listened and reflected
1011.99,1015.23, spoken stories but he was surrounded by all these
1015.29,1018.68, important people and his mother and his father came upon him
1019.19,1023.66, also what it was that he was doing that he was really just preaching in the temple
1024.14,1026.06, a priest who had done
1029.12,1037.22, i think it was mary who said that he should come home to his father and his mother and he said that he had no place besides in his father's house
1038.78,1040.97, of course he didn't mean joseph
1043.19,1046.13, it's not like he didn't love them because he did
1047.63,1048.65, just that
1048.74,1052.01, he had to love everybody else as much as he loved them
1053.9,1056.66, that's why he's just like a ghost like
1057.86,1059.78, untouchable person
1060.83,1063.35, she wasn't ever allowed to love
1063.53,1065.75, pursued in some cases
1067.22,1071.36, especially by mary magdalene who had so
1071.54,1072.8, he had such a
1072.89,1074.9, tremendous amount of
1074.96,1077.54, power over and through really
1078.32,1081.56, she became one of his first female disciples and
1081.77,1086.99, him but he wasn't allowed to love because that wasn't his business he was most
1087.29,1094.01, everybody else in the world as equally and i don't think that it meant that he loved his parents to his family any less
1095.81,1098.09, everybody else as much
1101.48,1105.14, people talk about having broken hearts
1105.26,1109.82, because of specific relationships and individuals
1110.03,1112.19, have made them said
1113.54,1118.01, that's all that jesus is heart was therefore was to be broken
1119.36,1125.03, the only reason that he existed with seven his heart could open completely in falling
1126.59,1130.46, to be battered and abuse so much like the people
1130.61,1133.25, claimed to love him turned against him
1133.94,1135.41, he predicted it
1135.77,1139.46, peter and through judas who said that they would both betray him
1140.12,1142.88, deny him in just would betray him
1143.12,1144.29, they did
1145.73,1147.83, never stopped loving them
1149.33,1151.01, i said to him
1151.25,1152.15, said
1156.86,1158.9, something along the lines of
1159.56,1161.15, this is what you want
1161.15,1162.17, what
1162.56,1165.8, to happen you know that it has to happen this way
1167.12,1170.99, she's as had received dreams messages dreams
1171.32,1173.03, from god
1173.96,1177.77, that within a few days he was going to be crucified
1180.68,1184.19, when jesus confronted judas at the last supper and said
1188.93,1190.13, said
1190.19,1191.78, you want me to do it
1193.22,1195.11, that is the only way
1196.55,1199.91, how could i run your ambition
1202.07,1204.38, jesus called them before
1207.02,1207.98, because
1210.8,1212.24, a man
1213.5,1216.05, he was the son of man
1216.14,1218.0, well as the son of god
1218.15,1221.99, as the sun of all mankind
1222.83,1224.33, perfect being
1224.39,1227.93, he was still a man and he was still afraid to die
1230.15,1230.93, and
1231.8,1235.67, night after the last supper when everyone else had fallen asleep
1236.12,1237.02, he walked
1237.29,1241.73, the garden and he said if there is any other way for this to happen
1241.79,1243.53, happen that way
1244.37,1246.14, why should i die for this
1247.67,1250.43, feel as sure as i did in the beginning
1251.45,1253.55, in the beginning i was inspired
1255.14,1258.53, and that's when he swept blood
1263.12,1265.16, then said fin i'll die
1266.93,1270.05, it's such a strange interpretation to because
1271.31,1273.62, he wouldn't have been crucified
1273.74,1277.25, one of breather no story like
1280.82,1282.11, he
1282.8,1289.46, any other person has ever done and he sort of kindly it would have been one of those stories
1289.46,1293.3, a story and the last at all but
1296.27,1305.15, of a person sacrificing their life for another person or for an entire body of people or for the entire world
1305.66,1307.73, glorious statement
1308.12,1309.44, huge
1309.56,1311.21, can't be denied
1312.35,1314.03, i think that was the point
1314.27,1315.71, so much that
1315.77,1318.2, tito save our souls 
1318.5,1319.82, in
1320.66,1323.42, more in death than that
1326.33,1332.48, he had to die to spread the message because if he wouldn't have died then into sort of been another nice story
1332.78,1338.78, because he died at the huge story ever it's the biggest in the most important
1341.9,1344.51, people react to it very poorly
1344.84,1348.65, most part the largest percentage of people react to it poorly
1348.74,1352.79, because they're being told that they are inherently sinners
1353.18,1355.1, that their businesses
1355.16,1358.73, but sending and the fair imperfect
1361.85,1365.15, that can be traced back to the story of adam
1367.04,1369.08, the initial sin
1370.91,1373.55, taking the fruit
1373.58,1380.06, that's not true that wasn't the initial sin because the desire to take the fruit in the first place was there
1380.57,1384.38, the thought of a desire to take the fruit in the first place was there
1385.64,1387.2, that brings it back
1387.95,1389.84, had to be that way
1391.7,1394.04, person has to fall from grace
1396.44,1398.87, everyone is used to be born again
1400.31,1402.38, to be a full circle
1403.67,1409.01, a falling away and beginning to think and going inside herself and going out of yourself
1409.19,1411.59, thinking more than spreading the word
1412.76,1416.09, there is no final complete achievement here
1418.04,1421.52, necessarily about reaching peace for yourself but
1423.35,1425.48, i heard a tone said don't know
1425.6,1426.83, but
1427.04,1428.18, about
1429.92,1431.21, being
1433.97,1436.7, persons lack of ability to love
1437.12,1441.08, having been a person rising to their ability to love
1441.38,1443.57, i think that's completely true
1445.79,1448.1, a person with that their sole
1451.82,1457.58, last i think and make him feel in love but they will hurt the people that their closest to
1460.79,1462.95, truly be able to love
1463.07,1466.64, love every person not just a person for yourself
1467.63,1470.54, the biggest accomplishment and that's
1470.69,1472.58, i was sent for
1473.93,1476.72, whether or not he did everything that he did
1477.08,1478.43, are there
1478.46,1479.96, that means that
1480.17,1482.15, was sent by god
1483.38,1486.32, i think a lot of people were sent by god
1488.09,1489.77, the fact of
1490.19,1497.51, the immaculate conception whether or not it is a fact it is a fact because it is in writing because it's in the bible
1499.37,1500.36, there
1506.81,1510.32, means that jesus was sent so directly that there's no
1510.47,1511.85, it
1518.63,1520.88, act so poorly to 
1521.18,1525.2, want to hear that their centers in any way
1541.49,1549.44, not even like that though it's not even like it something that you've gained throughout your life by doing more and more things wrong
1552.05,1555.35, just there and that's part of the perfection
1558.71,1561.02, nothing separate from god
1561.23,1564.14, it all comes from god
1565.01,1567.65, and the station
1568.43,1571.76, comes from god there was no mistake
1572.24,1573.74, there is no mistake
1578.09,1579.53, be a sinner
1579.83,1582.44, essentially is to be perfect than
1583.1,1586.13, because it is a person for feeling god's plan
1586.28,1588.86, we all have to be sinners we all
1589.61,1591.29, to feel pain
1591.5,1594.53, you think of the ten commandments which are
1595.07,1598.25, definition of separate in
1599.06,1602.03, listen so that you don't commit them
1603.02,1606.26, there really nothing more than advice for happiness
1608.12,1609.65, if you stay
1609.95,1613.49, probably not going to feel very happy
1617.0,1621.71, a person you're probably not going to feel very happy if you're envious
1621.92,1623.36, ugliness
1623.69,1625.97, if you're having a fair
1626.39,1628.85, probably not going to feel very happy
1629.72,1631.64, may be momentary but
1633.29,1634.64, not true
1637.55,1638.99, just advice
1639.53,1641.33, how to be happy
1641.84,1644.06, o to feel love truly
1644.69,1646.64, how not to judge people
1646.76,1649.91, how to feel ultimate compassion
1650.99,1654.53, person is bad because they send but rather the
1663.56,1665.81, moral is inherent
1667.37,1670.58, even the most remote culture who have no
1671.06,1672.26, at with
1672.32,1673.82, on
1674.57,1675.92, understand
1677.54,1680.9, the things that are not necessarily right and wrong
1681.02,1683.12, things that a person feels
1685.34,1687.71, as another person pain
1689.99,1691.67, feel that greed
1692.9,1697.28, what adam and i is that first example of the fact that
1698.6,1702.11, be driving this sadness today will be greed
1702.83,1706.37, more sex or more money or more
1706.49,1708.44, food or more clothing
1708.89,1711.53, these things that's just greed
1712.55,1715.19, why the fewer trees
1716.3,1718.4, why there is more murder
1720.62,1722.06, but greed
1724.58,1726.65, that for whatever reason
1726.86,1728.06, written
1728.69,1730.25, it is inherent
1731.42,1733.37, the perfect example
1733.61,1735.62, necessarily think that
1735.8,1740.9, first people in the world were adamant certainly there's evidence of evolution
1744.95,1751.31, first there was nothing and out of that nothingness came god and god was that nothing next in the first place
1754.19,1758.45, through that it was written that greed is what is going to propel us
1759.47,1761.0, unhappiness
1761.99,1763.34, god knew that
1763.64,1766.73, that's part of the perfection that's part of the plan
1769.19,1771.29, you understand that through
1775.37,1777.02, feel that it's
1778.01,1782.03, wrong or it doesn't feel right it doesn't feel like a love
1782.42,1786.44, doesn't make you feel in love with life and with every one
1789.11,1791.03, something to drive away from
1793.91,1797.39, the bible is full of those things at first examples
1797.39,1798.71, and the
1799.91,1801.56, the first recording of
1801.62,1802.49, murder
1802.88,1805.73, first murder according to the story
1807.14,1809.54, just an example of effects
1809.93,1813.62, that we have to deal with every person in one way or another
1813.62,1815.06, murder
1816.41,1818.87, he had a lot of one murdered
1820.67,1822.41, afraid of murder and it
1822.71,1823.91, propels us
1824.33,1826.1, makes us paranoid
1827.63,1829.37, people here murder
1829.43,1831.53, disgusted or said
1834.5,1838.67, that the bible is it's just a statement of things that are going to be there
1838.82,1841.01, discusses the first priesthood
1842.69,1844.46, discusses the first rate
1845.96,1847.7, first favor
1848.36,1849.47, people
1851.3,1854.69, just a discussion of the way things are going to be
1855.74,1858.62, and it lies of the answers of how
1860.27,1864.83, not to avoid those things but that there is hope to get away from those things
1865.94,1867.95, a vacant you that
1868.58,1870.05, i live
1871.01,1872.81, you can tell people
1873.47,1875.42, i can tell more people
1875.54,1878.48, those people those people by the
1878.93,1880.55, to have children
1881.18,1883.79, they're going to tell their children jesus is love
1886.67,1888.23, compassionate love
1888.29,1892.4, his compassion jesus's compassion it's all the same thing
1893.3,1899.81, things are real and this message is going to be spread i probably won't see it but that's not what i'm doing it for
1900.2,1901.85, for me to see
1904.82,1906.89, that's where faith comes in
1908.48,1909.8, knowledge that
1911.15,1913.22, this is working towards
1913.31,1914.87, i plan
1916.07,1919.43, there are things that i've seen but i don't understand
1920.09,1921.17, are
1921.92,1925.04, murderer that i don't understand
1925.1,1927.17, die before they have a chance
1928.19,1931.1, or to see any sort of light
1933.23,1937.97, i don't understand it but all i can think is that perhaps it's just another example
1957.53,1962.24, i can say that through time at his brought me closer to what i believe in
1964.16,1965.57, having sex
1968.78,1972.83, there was a point in time where i didn't feel love
1973.01,1974.48, in that
1974.54,1976.79, i went to feel love
1977.3,1978.47, much
1982.4,1984.71, everything happens for a reason
1984.8,1986.63, and the fact that
1988.46,1990.05, gone to
1995.78,1999.14, a few or many depending on
1999.23,2000.58, opinion
2000.7,2002.32, many people
2002.32,2004.18, oh love
2006.37,2007.75, specific
2009.82,2011.86, i don't have sex now
2012.31,2013.81, want to
2014.38,2017.2, feel attracted to people that way
2017.32,2020.17, not my business right now
2020.53,2024.01, that would preoccupy me and i'm not interested in it
2032.83,2035.17, i don't feel like now
2035.41,2037.66, having sex could bring me
2038.41,2042.13, o god i feel like it pushes me away
2042.52,2045.64, a lover that i want to have is jesus
2045.88,2048.76, the only one that i can have right now
2049.99,2052.45, know if it will be different
2053.05,2055.78, really it doesn't scare me though
2057.88,2058.93, i know that
2059.29,2066.01, my life is planned and designed for me and i don't worry about it
2066.22,2070.27, i meant to never find a person who
2074.92,2077.44, fulfil that way
2077.77,2080.65, not just not just the sex through
2080.89,2087.19, everything through actual love if i'm never to find a person like that that's fine with me i
2087.79,2090.52, without a person like that
2094.99,2098.44, a strange thing for maybe because i feel like
2102.07,2104.11, is certainly a gift
2104.47,2106.87, i don't know if it is a gift
2107.77,2112.03, specifically in only for reproduction or if it
2112.27,2115.42, beyond that i don't really know
2122.86,2125.44, depends on who it is
2126.82,2127.81, he
2128.65,2132.61, depends as a line that crosses women does become
2133.15,2134.8, sexual and
2135.43,2137.5, like to cross that line
2138.13,2140.32, doesn't feel right for me
2142.42,2152.02, i know that i'm not supposed to be a nun and not supposed to be chaste that way because there are many none like the carmelites who
2152.41,2154.84, their faces always and
2155.32,2164.35, can't talk to people they live their lives in silence which is an altogether a bad thing at all in fact i've considered it before but
2165.46,2169.96, i know that i'm not supposed to be a nun because my work is done with people who
2170.35,2171.91, to me
2172.75,2176.29, because they think i am beautiful
2176.83,2179.32, the people who come to me
2179.68,2184.03, want to kiss me because they think i'm beautiful but they are
2184.12,2187.6, completely in that ignoring the fact that
2187.81,2195.85, what i look like is only a gift from god and not even so much a gift which is part of his plan that people would come to me
2197.26,2205.24, because they see me in for whatever reason my face or my attitude of my spirit as i sat icy pleasing and they see that
2205.6,2214.6, stop there just that it's as beautiful so i'll talk to her and maybe she'll kiss me maybe she'll sleep with me but
2215.5,2220.39, offend me bothers me i don't like to be treated that way
2220.42,2225.49, happens a lot but i really i don't like it that's not what i'm about
2226.51,2229.27, would like to think that i'm even
2232.63,2235.51, in some ways i am in some ways and not
2237.91,2242.53, no a lot of people have said that about me
2242.77,2250.3, truly a lot of people have i think people would rather think of me as a person who would like to
2252.01,2255.1, many a young fellow but it's not true
2255.22,2261.07, i don't have that desire in me it's just not something that i feel
2262.45,2267.52, i'm just colder fritter something but it's just not something that i feel
2267.76,2272.11, i don't want that i don't find fulfilment through that
2272.59,2277.21, that may be i will some day but i diston no it's
2278.14,2280.57, an there's 
2286.78,2289.15, would only be a person who
2290.8,2296.47, treated very very very poorly on the street by a person
2297.61,2302.29, would only be a person who if treated very poorly by a person
2302.65,2307.0, not think that that person is awful but rather would think
2307.63,2320.05, that person has gone through things that they just have not experienced and therefore they are in no place to judge it at all that is the only type of person that i could ever imagine myself wanting to sleep with
2320.29,2325.36, doesn't work otherwise there's no motion there i don't really feel it
2333.01,2334.09, he
2337.6,2339.1, as his terrible
2351.37,2352.03, he
2377.98,2380.65, and in trying
2381.46,2382.57, at
2387.52,2390.85, i am not perfect
2391.75,2392.65, and
2395.32,2399.67, i have reactions that i understand could hurt people
2400.3,2401.86, i'm close to
2402.43,2404.26, and to avoid that
2404.8,2405.82, i
2408.22,2412.9, mostly it happens when i'm angry when i'm upset when i feel like
2415.63,2418.72, my reaction would not fulfil my beliefs
2419.29,2422.8, my reaction would be less than compassionate
2424.0,2424.87, and
2425.92,2427.78, to people
2427.99,2430.15, to practise what i
2433.99,2440.92, when i paint it's really only a physical portrayal
2441.82,2443.86, what i see is
2444.25,2449.14, lines and the curves in the shapes and the colors of what i see
2450.46,2457.93, it's just these physical things because that usually what i'm confronted with is just this physical behavior
2458.08,2458.95, and
2460.0,2462.64, approach or a defence
2463.72,2464.71, and
2465.1,2469.57, i do art it's not abstract it's not so
2470.29,2472.57, just what i see it's
2474.13,2476.98, absolute in a sense as
2477.67,2479.86, every line it's not
2479.92,2487.6, necessarily really a person's face but every line that composes a person's face and every color that is within their face
2490.15,2498.49, just matter it's the simplest thing it's the physical world it's all that's there and really nothing more it's
2499.87,2505.57, for anger frustration her sadness to flowing
2506.74,2507.94, and
2508.0,2509.89, paper
2511.3,2517.66, he makes me pretty angry but i love it it's something that i feel very very passionate about
2518.32,2521.44, really only two things in the
2521.74,2526.57, very opposite that they form a perfect circle that
2527.5,2529.66, my faith and my art
2538.63,2545.26, it's like being on stage
2546.49,2549.64, very easily like being unstaged
2550.99,2560.17, it going out and understanding that they are all these other beings around me doing all these different things there going through whatever they are going through
2561.13,2562.96, some people who are
2564.52,2567.55, like me in some way on some level
2567.67,2570.91, make contact and they look at me
2572.08,2573.76, people who
2574.12,2578.2, my phone number who make contact and will look at me
2583.15,2587.59, strange because going out in public use makes me want to
2589.81,2591.43, for
2591.82,2593.29, microphone
2594.13,2595.57, speakers
2595.69,2601.9, just told him around in a wagon behind me so that i can shout to every one
2602.8,2604.27, just tell them
2604.27,2605.59, things
2607.87,2611.62, because i see people's reactions i think very honestly
2612.64,2615.43, i see with their feeling and what the thinking
2618.64,2620.38, sometimes people
2621.28,2624.79, themselves from me i don't know me just
2624.79,2630.49, looking at me there protecting themselves although trying for something that is
2630.55,2631.81, honest
2632.23,2637.99, they're not looking at me for some reason her there looking directly at me for some reason
2637.99,2641.5, so many different levels and so many different games
2641.8,2643.93, me want to shout
2643.99,2650.47, like being honest city but now get on and every one is there but no one is saying a single thing to any one else
2650.83,2653.29, the people who actually are 
2653.29,2654.7, in some way
2654.91,2658.57, more pathetic than everyone else for some reason
2668.38,2671.86, if i go out and feel
2674.29,2677.38, i'm filled with and compelled by a love
2678.19,2680.8, but and here love
2680.83,2683.62, last desire and that
2683.71,2688.33, business at all but just like her love if i feel
2688.96,2695.56, forced by a full of it then i walk with it and i smile with it
2696.22,2699.19, some people think or she smiling at me
2699.97,2704.05, that must mean something in that gives them liberty to
2704.92,2707.08, on my phone number
2708.37,2710.56, sort of upsetting but
2711.07,2712.93, not something that is
2713.14,2714.37, completely
2714.58,2719.98, line it's not something that i can't understand because i do understand it
2735.94,2743.2, it seems just a rush of thoughts nothing too specific no person just the feeling
2743.35,2750.49, and that's just it it's no person there's no person it's myself i'm aware of
2751.72,2754.99, i am able to do for myself
2755.47,2757.51, and that fine
2758.5,2760.87, feels more right than
2762.07,2763.63, in a person
2771.55,2775.3, oh absolutely in both
2782.29,2788.32, like the feeling of understanding my body in a way that no one else can
2788.83,2790.36, really at all
2794.38,2795.73, being
2801.22,2803.41, simple i mean
2804.64,2808.99, comfortable in surprise so i hear that other people don't do it
2810.64,2813.04, a good thing for me
2823.78,2826.78, i suppose if i didn't know how to
2827.32,2829.63, myself so well
2830.08,2832.48, i may be turned to other people
2834.52,2836.95, through that the gift of
2836.98,2843.13, rationally has been a gift then given to me so that i would have to turn to other people
2844.81,2854.2, not something that i couldn't do without certainly if i felt like that was telling me not to masturbate i certainly wouldn't do it i wouldn't have any problem with it but
2856.33,2858.82, feel fine and wonderful to me
2860.65,2862.81, i love it it's a nice feeling
2864.85,2871.27, it really independent feeling because i don't think of a person i don't think of any previous act
2871.6,2873.07, just me
2876.01,2891.7, it's on this the true like sex so many times just become so untrue and dishonest and there is the thing to worry about and there's whether or not this is going to go right or that's going to go right but you don't even have to do with that at all
2891.76,2894.52, just you and yourself
2904.93,2911.05, i could only then discuss the difference between you and i
2913.87,2923.41, i think it's an eaps it's only me convincing myself but it's my idea of the fact that i don't need other people
2923.44,2924.73, i
2926.23,2932.08, need people to make me feel a certain way that it's all been given to me that
2932.11,2934.57, innocence i'm complete that way
2934.78,2939.07, i don't need anything more than i have right now and
2939.88,2941.32, being able to
2941.53,2945.67, masters is just a gift and
2946.36,2956.26, you choose to think about other people or other circumstances the previous acts than that commence tainly that's fine
2956.41,2957.43, i think
2959.95,2961.3, perhaps it's
2962.11,2963.55, because
2963.85,2965.92, i feel like i am
2966.46,2969.94, i can't speak to you at all but i feel like i am
2972.01,2981.43, very intense and for the most part very loving towards myself like
2983.92,2986.41, to do things the best that i can
2986.5,2987.37, and
2989.59,2991.69, a person to
2992.62,2994.81, make me feel any certain way
2995.23,2996.94, i don't know
