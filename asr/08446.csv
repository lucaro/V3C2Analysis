0.06,84.63, no no he was like a dynamic into was like me talk about being it was last week he said meeting an outgo on problem game as anyone seen a response like it it was like a dam bust you were saying that god benders for the worst now people who take ages no bad spots the results still haven't stopped coming in to loiter then again maybe that's not surprising table games are so motive because they represent a social contract between players in the name of creating farmery body agrees to follow some rules but also that they are care about them nebulous concept of winning they be quiet when other people are taking their turn they won't leave the table they live pay attention think quickly adopted character or establish some value in winning as a team or coming second or beans osburga a problem players aboard amatolas of social cues and if you break one of these rules that you ruin the evening for everybody or do you let's just start off with a little bit of perspective or right if you love for games and rules this much you might have a touch of the control freak about you i absolutely too and one glass palaces of rules are really just a speck in a larger realm
84.63,85.92, play
86.1,109.08, i was guilty as anybody of pooping myself with rangement of checks they found during a roseland and buried in my macon is everybody who's ever been my neronians but my game night a better now because i've realized that the fastest way to fix a problem play is to change the contract between yourself and them so their behavior isn't a problem any
109.11,118.86, altemus pay attention must be because if they don't must then everybody's going to be happier including you
118.95,140.85, in the list of problem plays sent to us were people who fed it people who don't notice it their turn and people who don't have forenoon cuartito at no uninclosed who are filante archetype the cherished player someone who overlooks people's floors and just this to have a good team what i'm saying is time your first of all that your lot petulantly with
140.85,317.43, unreasonable expectations and outside that goose reprehensible characters who should go to jail omowaneba the only activity in bargaining so reviled they had to make a name for it could domain as when another player takes your turn for you ah if you go here than you can defeat that gusty should do that anything he asked you just one on you as if you move over i can do take a ten foot outline to have an easy fix just tell the other player actually in need to make decisions myself to have fun and if they keep at it just to come and every time they do it make it into a joke and if they still keep at it look them in the eye and perform the exact opposite move so as connotation that way as tooterson buckles so now and think about bumble bees and yet remind them that if the tune or who checked their phone during a roseann or an intense orseshoes let's be real though there is no sequence of magic words you can say to make some one care about the board game which loves you with two options right one just ask them if they want out there's no shame that say you want senor i can tell it you know it's not for every one that's fine if marooned a man on the moon and you can figure out how to extract supply from a board game also here's the thing what you want from a boot you will people to come over and have for you have the best time well in thinking about bumble bees or checking twitter that player is probably having the most fun baked have trapped in this organ a believer not the best thing you can do for that is be chill and let them do what they want to do every one will have a better time to bother people who are too aggressive or not aggressive enough cartouch about wedding or not enough or cato much about winning the dog real so many messages from people who don't like count some people play games but i've got some bad news for you you see it's all cattle annoying if your friends on to can play a game that you bought but once there there and they're enjoying themselves and your furious because there not having from the way you think they should have fun you are entering the realm of the comedy farthest you canting of it this way human beings are the most complex wonderful mysterious component in any board game except for the crystal skills in talking and you have to let them be themselves because burgomaster with your friends and family people that you love that all this whole hobbies a bill and as such you fathomless otherwise you're ruining the entire for every one even stuff this seems truly reprehensible like a couple refusing to attack each other and ruining the political bamacharee but not about you
317.76,321.99, about a couple of creating a wonderful memory together
322.29,356.73, but for all depolarization did overrule exclamations but i forgot to mention what you should do if some one's being a total tentatively hackling you or distracting the rules explanation or otherwise getting in your way and the answer is everthing wanted to be the center of attention let them be the centre of attention change your walentine so you are only talking to them tell them how they win and what their playhouse you and then with the only person in the room and my god they got to be the center pretension but they also find it very hard to be a treat
356.76,400.95, these days before rose isolation attendance in brabant rather than under every enjoyment which tend to make people want to joke around or not listen if i say a estimating a contented in a few minutes if you will pay attention then people tend to be there on your side you can other working with you when the rules are precious of your ordering her cause you don't want to do it and that's useful but also kind of more boring and meeting no bear people who became so this one an easy face most in the top as soon as you see some one saturation look it but actually it's really expensive so i could you be careful with it
400.95,439.11, i become be competent and stop most of the time if they keep doing it it's just how it not there for hot even if they felt something is not about fault probably you have to not three count for two reasons first off if you spill something on a game and tires out that is all any one will remember of that evening a guarantee but the other and that awful so you will avoid than all parts but the other reason you shouldn't be out is i came when you buy a board game you want to keep it in mecanicien but actually that's really were the best possible state for inescation can go to rubaconte or all the malayo much they just destroyed
439.14,440.4, wreck
440.82,463.11, not because someone was careless with an it's just what happens and you know what we worry about organs being destroyed but it doesn't make you love them any less when it happened i mean what have has a really good line on this you can buy a piece for fifteen pounds at it and throw away the box he by a board damote pounds and suddenly in on you and you can't let anything happen to it even at the
463.11,467.13, you know creation of the rest of your life that doesn't make any sense just
467.22,468.78, philosophical about it
469.29,474.63, players who make other players uncomfortable
474.81,490.08, talk i've been a bargain convention so that people have used gay lousiest one of my friends i've seen a woman almost reduced to tears by my progressions and an event that i've organized how hard a discussion and problem plays not include me telling you that if some one is being genuinely upset
490.14,521.97, you know a bordighera stand for that and don't say you know you're upsetting this person because then you know after they won't want to be the center potential and don't say you upsetting me because then you leave the door open to them saying well you shouldn't be upset by one i'm doing i should know because i've been that guy and i feel terrible about it it just happens so say we don't stand there that's what you do you say sorry you're being too aggressive we don't use what's like that whatever they're doing just hardiment do that 
522.18,531.24, and you have to because an interesting thing when i asked for problem plays nineteen nine per cent of the responses i got were about this to pass me off
532.83,541.71, the deists to double in the next five years that is so many new people for us to play with so many new people to support help the industry
541.77,575.55, i think when we talk about problem plays this would be a great time to shift what that term means in bodmin you know maybe less about all i get annoyed when people do this and more about making sure we don't have plays that are going to make all most wonderful new people feel up unwelcome let's make sure their welcome let's watch or behaviour in that sense right i think that would be really good allerheiligen though why not in the commons to this video why don't you leave your favorite thing a friend or found member has done in the game that was just then being themselves all to
575.82,577.86, thank you all so much fortune
