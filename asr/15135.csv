18.66,44.49, and when we were asked to imagine twenty fifty food and farming i think it's a measure of how exciting it is for designers to just dream without consequences because we jump right in and we thought of just what can we do and we looked at a resource available to day that would still be around in forty years
44.49,51.15, massalia tion we saw containers gets that are coming off the line right now
51.33,62.49, a year life span and then they'll start to decay and to be dumped on the beaches and torn apart by hand and we wanted to find another way for these to have a new life
62.58,72.69, and so we packed them with seeds and we lashed them together and we sailed them off to singapore and created these huge floating farms and gardens
72.81,80.04, and that was really exciting but then we thought you know we have to look back and
80.07,97.32, this idea a little bit more and see what other people have tried to imagine my name's any franciscan with future farmers we found a river students at stanford university who are asked in nineteen seventy five to imagine a space colony that would be launched into space by nineteen eighty seven
97.62,99.84, the designing grief was falling
99.96,106.95, human looking in space must have an adequate diet and food must be nutritious sufficiently abundant and attractive
107.37,111.36, enough water to sustain life and to maintain sanitation
111.6,121.68, the importance of the psychological aspects of food should not be neglected the variety and tax of food should reflect the cultural background and preferences of the colonists
122.16,133.47, so these were considerations that were given to the designers by asa and they had two weeks to imagine what life would be like in the self sustainable space calling that would arbitrate
133.95,135.9, the question to ask
135.9,140.55, we see as a potential for this ship planetara
140.58,152.61, one sort of terrible future snarled avolation from noses you know as soon aluminum clad building is canochet inhabited by fossati people
152.91,162.78, so on their food from you know from life the sun so matapedia invited
162.84,191.25, i am going to talk to but my ideas of the future farming but before i can talk about that i need to talk about to day and what's going on today and the way i see things happening as actually happened yesterday i got a phone call from an unprofitable to know if a corporation could sponsor a farm and what that meant disette would give us free dirt which is something that we already had plenty of
191.25,255.3, they could give a tree seedlings which we have because we have a whole network of people are helping each other and they could pay a part time farmer to leave the group for six hours a week probably somewhere around ten dollars an hour and in exchange we would put up three signs on the farm unaided for feet which twenty feet by twenty feet and we would put up a sign that would advertise for this oration he would allow them to set up the tent and give away product samples and the best part of it is that we were allowed to know who the sponsor was in a society that teaches young people that farming is a really respectable field to go into that it not only a valuable pursuit and i pursued their requires creativity but oppersite compensated i mean i think it should be illegal for people to another you know twenty acres of land
255.63,256.74, that
258.06,259.8, should be illegal for
259.89,266.19, one person not to own an acre or any found me not to own a maker happier
266.28,297.87, we need people who contain this knowledge over a great amount of time which is dependent on all all of these small pieces of information you can't write in a book what works in this one farm one place and what worked in this other farm another place and individual like cooperative extension agents all this knowledge and dispense it to the public i think that in a location a hundred years ago that when we take a petroleum out there would be a lot more manhattaners humans
298.14,316.65, human scale and it'll be complicated instead of simple and pelting cultures that manicure twenty fifty the land is all barren most people have a box like this one every one's life
316.74,325.44, walking through the gray and brown world gray and brown and brown and gray hoping and waiting
325.44,327.6, something green
327.99,331.92, you put it in your box and protect it
331.92,340.11, he 
352.05,352.98, he
355.47,367.35, you put it in your box to protect it or i guess to protect the hope in it often you show friends
368.43,373.71, often you show friends what is in your box as a way to share your hope
373.95,391.11, i mean it's not always so nice i saw one man beat some one with a piece of concrete for the hope in what little green might be in their box i've also seen face hope you know the old faith plastic flowers
391.44,401.55, grandfather made my box he lived in a land of green where people didn't need to carry boxes around to protect their hope
402.39,408.54, i mean we could have allowed all the nightingales and all the actions in
408.63,414.54, you know my motto the great work at notting
414.87,425.52, also to some of the danites and they have seen a amityville is encomenderos blended like as indolently
425.97,469.11, the future agriculture eliminates the light of paronomasia or even to the end the lootenant an hispanica or nowhere here ganganelli is partitioned so distant wheresoever thou beyond the little nonentities
