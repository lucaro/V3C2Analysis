9.06,21.9, hello my name is polly moss and i'm going to tell you a story to day about grief and about how painting helped me work through that grief
21.96,27.69, i am sharing the story with you to day because i'm hoping to bring grief out into the open
27.78,32.97, to talk about something that almost no one wants to talk about to give great a voice in a way
33.78,41.58, in doing this i'm hoping that will help others who are may be going through the same experience
41.7,49.8, and i'm also hoping that it may encourage those of you who are going through an experience like this to use the creative process to help you through this
51.33,56.76, four years ago on september the world was completely shattered
57.27,60.75, that day my beloved husband tom allen
60.87,62.76, died of stomach cancer
62.79,66.09, he had only been diagnosed by an half weeks before that
67.44,76.77, money many months after my husband died i felt as though the pain and grief that i in despair that i felt would never lift
77.1,82.98, i was pretty sure i wouldn't survive and in fact in many ways to want to survive
82.98,89.43, my husband must my entire life he was everything to me and it was my greatest fear that he would leave before me
89.55,94.41, i have felt in many ways like i had fallen through an abyss
94.5,100.47, my husband's death i had been thrown into the ranks of millions who had walked this terrible road before me
100.95,104.94, one of the most universal of all human experiences
105.24,111.3, love someone to be a wife a husband a parent a child a friend a brother
111.3,117.45, it means that you owe most likely have your own experience with grief one day
117.54,135.57, yet despite the fact that it was something that almost everybody experiences at least once in their life time grief is something that has been driven into the shadows in our culture and because of that it is something that has to be suffered in solitude and isolation for those going through it
136.77,141.57, because of this i felt desperately alone in my grief and needed to find a voice for it
142.26,151.62, people suggested that i try journal but for me or seemed completely insufficient my grief seemed to be beyond words
152.7,157.77, i'm a pater and prior to my husband's death i painted landscapes
158.22,159.96, to my husband died
160.05,163.62, i couldn't bring myself to pay anything at all much less a landscape
164.19,172.53, in fact i found myself completely overcome with the nursia unable to do hardly anything at all except things that i needed you for my basic survival
173.28,177.57, after a period of almost eight months i picked up a paper
177.99,192.27, i approached the canvas i wasn't sure what i was going to pay i just set down to pat and what came out was the picture of a heart i later called it a wounded heart once i started painting the wooden wounded hearts i couldn't stop
192.63,195.63, over a period of the next three years i painted
195.75,198.12, campuses of wounded hearts
198.18,205.23, after each painting i felt as though a little piece of pain had been released from my heart and placed on to the canvas
205.77,225.21, paintings served as a catharsis they served as a communication has a voice for my grief and ultimately they help us solid looking back now in these twelve paintings i can see that they clearly depict my personal journey through grief
226.29,230.25, served as a documentation of my fight for survival
230.46,236.04, documentation of the transformation of grief and the cellaress
237.45,243.39, now been four years since my husband died but my journey through grief is far from over
243.78,249.0, as time passes grief changes form but it remains none the less
249.03,266.19, and although i am no longer painting hearts and still painting my grief and i still find the process there appeared in its still helps me express feeling sick came expressed in any other way it also provides me back to me about emotion to that might may not realize him experiencing
266.58,286.74, find and have found since paid in all of my wounded hearts and the canvases that i paint now i find that the papers sometimes knows what the mind does not and therefore helps me understand feelings in issues that i may not have realized that i was experiencing or struggling with until they see them expressed on the canvas
287.19,294.18, i'm sure the story with you in the hope that i might help one of my fellow travellers in this journey through grief
294.18,307.26, and help you know the turnout alone and that there is hope and that expressing yourself to the create a process whether it repaid him or drawing or photograph or writing is one way to help you get through this terrible journey
309.33,328.86, you are a teetotaller
