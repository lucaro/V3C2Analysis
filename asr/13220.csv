0.09,16.23, there this is oliver from anteroom and a dictatorial well covered the second part of the materials light and rendering to toil so
16.38,17.79, to blend
17.97,27.6, and i have a little scene with a monkey mish a plain and well the start came in light
27.6,35.85, it widens what happens if we have no comrade and no lights with no camera you cannot render
35.91,37.92, well let's try
38.88,43.32, i told you no camera so we need to create a camera
44.88,51.63, use the one you have at the start of the of the project that
52.05,58.68, in this case i am showing you how to create a new one which is now no mystery at all
62.94,64.32, something 
68.01,70.17, this should be cool
71.97,79.05, and now if we have no light in the winder everything we appear in black
80.07,84.6, see seatback soles create a new light
86.58,98.1, lamp and see you have several types of lamps gave the normal one is the point lamp i lets placid softly here
98.79,106.41, right and now we are going to take a look at the light barometers cantor here
106.56,110.88, let's see what happens when we went
110.88,124.26, you have lied you have no shadows were going to see how to treat them right now you have the point lamp which is the normal light just a point that meets light
124.83,139.2, everywhere and in every direction the sun is a direction or light katerina of the sea will be eliminated from the same direction a
139.92,153.6, the spot is just like the point light but it has a onlimited angle of elimination autant confiture the ohtere can you can confute ah
153.81,162.72, the smoothness of the border gay with soles options here while you can take a look at them or your own
162.96,169.41, in this trial and going to work just with a point and lambert
170.67,212.01, very cool light is just a light that midnight in one direction like the sun more less but it has no shadows so it is normally for a feeling a bit dark areas in the same key and then we have the real rights the relight which are which is some kind of riandar that imitate but well let go with a point light the seesaw before it has no shadows at all so let activate shadows here shadows
212.55,220.02, the second i'll care we have shadows now let's position in a bit
223.59,272.46, one thing to note is here while i hated in this plan you how to render an image for rendering you have to press the key if twelve kay or here you have the rennepont a distress image and you will render a frame of the animation the reason for in the enframe a here you will render an animation well let's make a look at the option of the granary here you have a rather lashin this it is attenuated gander where you want to make a random kasofu may find useful to render the mate or owindia this way
272.46,281.25, you will have the rent on a different window from that that is not planetarily prefer to use an imitator
281.31,298.56, going to take the bigger part you have in the scene in the i and it's going to take it as a renderest presses and you will be again on the freebooter
298.56,301.05, you can do it full screen
301.11,313.83, going to take all the blend their you i and change it to a to a redeemed katerina we're going to see its honor imitator
314.37,329.16, right here you have the day dimensions of the offer of the rather gay in the cases full dbut is rendered at the heat had the size kaheleha the frame range
329.49,347.52, want to walk the fence second aside this i you want to render just a part of the scene quiverful because you can ah with control i think it now she be
348.33,360.6, if you can render jest this part so quite useful for taking little part of the render if they work and all the stuff ah
361.2,364.56, the activate right now the ants
364.59,384.39, some shading options here if you want for example to make a quick reader to delight you probably don't need to render the dexters so the weather is faster or the shadows whatever kay this talebearer there is no match at all
384.51,387.63, you can see the background of the scene
387.9,395.76, if you want to render the sky or if you want to run the transparent black ground
395.76,409.23, normal the normal option i used my readers caesar way at post production we can add another image on the background
409.8,419.82, katherine were to save the frames on an animation gay so the quicker and you can
421.41,429.42, he was to say it but if you were there one frame you won't need to do it came because a
429.48,436.05, whether this not the store at all not safe just want frame render
436.08,464.07, you have to render it safe it madly gay so ah here you tell blendwell what formed you want to use for the mate and the channels you want a suspensive are quite good kaheleha some more options like the three you want to use of for of your computer
465.51,466.98, most pressing
467.25,469.95, no use combusting on the sequence
471.51,493.71, tom if you want to have the time or statistics of the reader on the mate and this is the bag which is another thing that less you render a ailesworth on the scene but honor a deer that are part of a model
493.77,500.13, so your project all the shadows and all the readers of one texture
500.28,501.87, pretty handy
501.87,506.82, it's a one we know how to make a render ah let's
507.57,508.92, light
508.98,524.7, so let's have a look again came we have the money we have a very black career and we have ah a very hard shadow so let's make the shadow softer
524.73,555.3, i have the suite to conceit is activated but the samples is just one so it renders very hard i want to oh to see its soft toned to a increase the samples the cyclical have it softer but you can see that is the quality is not very good at it is because we need more samples with tarnished be enough
557.34,558.75, pretty good
559.05,571.5, and you can increase there is the if much more but you will get a lot more of quality but the reader will take a lot of time
573.09,574.83, i see 
574.83,576.54, various low right now
577.62,582.39, so in this case we are going to use about seven
582.72,593.37, a temple so you can see how it works and here you can increase the soft size so now they will be even softer
593.88,600.63, again to see it better you will need to increase even more the samples
602.91,605.22, well
605.52,610.38, here you can change the color of the light he put it something
612.36,620.34, and he has the energy which is the well as that the energy of the lad again see here on the brave
621.33,623.73, no it's very bright
625.83,631.89, but its mother
632.94,635.64, something like this pretty 
636.39,640.65, right this is the the sense if you activate it
640.98,646.8, i see the light if you activated and put it for some poor
646.92,648.06, let me
649.29,652.89, the distance at the bitter
653.79,669.42, at this point just you see okay here you see the limits of the light so from pluto here is going to be the creasing the intensity casimir of gradient if we ran the right now
669.51,676.44, it will see that here the light has a little influence already
676.44,679.8, case so dear increased a bit more
682.17,693.0, now here it has some force but here is the definite is that all inquisitive and more this
705.48,715.14, something i did radicals in other to render quickly the previous to can do a
716.34,727.29, the percentage of the original size to run to hear you you will get smaller render but the runner will be pretty quick
728.13,752.94, right now as you can see we have this bright area but the face of the monkey is completely black so let's position the camera right here because i have the option of the bated of creating of detained with the bow so as create a lamp and in aulam
753.54,767.97, make a full light that illuminated it the face of the market silicieuses a lot
767.97,777.03, not that whatever you have the boat decision the hanwell be always from the active camera
777.57,780.99, if you have more cameras let's see
782.22,783.33, happens
784.2,804.0, another camera but the tide coming will still be the original line you can know what is one is the active camera because this anglicans this is why framed this is said
804.42,808.68, you can make a camera at tideswell
809.52,817.38, a switch to the camera with seron the number 
817.74,824.13, you can make another camera at the vibrating control so
826.26,831.72, so here you have not to come i can there is also another
833.97,837.12, i know where this
837.54,845.25, then there is an option camera cameron okay here you can switch also the camera which is the active camera
845.85,852.21, i can see the triangles switch okay so let's do it this one
853.68,856.62, and what else oh yes
856.83,878.91, let the cretans of this light the softlike not one let's see what happens gay we are starting to see them the monkey face but is still a very a lot of vanity so bonhomie let's make this a
878.94,880.44, i called
880.5,881.79, a thimble
887.25,890.94, the three
895.17,900.48, i don't like it at all but well you can see 
900.54,901.86, it works
905.22,919.89, simulation be enough but but happen if we press the point on the other geese switched the people point to the to the tedious and switch the
921.72,923.73, by this
929.37,930.36, all right
931.05,934.68, this different thing
934.86,938.43, increase the intensity
940.86,942.66, but
943.05,945.63, this
945.87,972.99, right this is cooler than the other option again now i'm going to show you a different guidelines on which is new englander to point five and i find it a very handy as letters and with them to another layer so we have not them here so caneback okay so let's go to the word pater
973.32,976.41, and here you can change the arsenal or
976.56,977.73, but
977.91,981.78, for now i'm going to prove white
983.25,987.87, and a that environment living
989.28,991.29, to sky color
991.47,993.72, and let what happens
994.77,1003.56, so was again see the light comes from everywhere so we get a very soft shadows
1004.88,1016.58, as we the normal lights conceived that we have here just fight sample so the quietest not very good but we can increase it in order to get better results
1016.73,1017.96, you have the
1019.19,1033.98, also we can activate a mitigation so we will get one of the cavities sunshades and that self but is better to have it to have it an multiply mode
1035.66,1037.7, i see
1038.03,1040.64, let's now 
1040.7,1042.41, the sky color
1043.85,1047.54, but it's nothing like this orange
1049.16,1063.11, i like courage and there we go if we now ah as his mind is to let it
1063.68,1086.87, show the light we are making them by omitting with with normal light so the mimeta iding gives a field wide that is very very cool i like it a lot but as we now withal no alumina ion in the scene may be is better to decrease this just a bit
1086.93,1091.25, increased the samples to fifteen
1091.25,1093.74, and let's see what happens
1097.34,1099.65, ay i'll it
1101.18,1103.94, make them by a melting cold
1105.02,1108.14, as to see what happens
1111.17,1112.7, here we got
1113.27,1115.88, make a final 
1117.32,1120.95, father
1122.42,1132.05, well it's pretty slow so ah you know how to use lights you know how to do for you then
1132.11,1167.93, just the basis that you understand them and you know how to use them by militate mitigation garakonthie the samples and some options here but well i have recommended testator own so you can see what happens when you change sanfordites and the delighting a well in the in the trunk rantaine's in the rank of blanderon have her actual indeed living
1168.17,1194.87, yes a proximate as well he doesn't or protectors and all the stuff oh so well you can think the rendering so there you will have actually intertwining but well ah i think when they are mere the branch the rather ranchito the trick i will make it to toil on intertwining so he we have the full atwater
1196.07,1208.13, it's very can well that's all he is soon in happy blending
