15.0,42.66, welcome every one to your bodies on the line since for him and the headlines on tumbleson and from oxford is an obvious and it were on a couple of guests there probably the ones that you are here from my solitude than the just a malefic professor caroline finch cheshire tor of australian centers into injury in sport and its prevention at the federation university someone the straitest alias leading sports injury epidemiologist
42.75,53.67, and sports injury prevention researcher she also advises federal and state government departments the if thessalian sports commission and numerous other sporting bodies
55.77,102.48, christ which is the assuring center for research and injury in sport is one of only four research centers worldwide to be designated by the international implicit as a center for research excellence into injury and illness prevention in light so welcome carolinian the gentleman he and doctor mark fisher is a sport doctor at sports midseason around oliver the porter laid football club deserted medical officer and he also with the australian sidling team is a leader in sports medicine and his late level experiencing clunes working with the australian team at the two thousand and eight and two thousand twelve olympics and the two thousand six and twenty ten commotion mark
102.48,109.41, i annotations on the agenda today but first of all i 
109.44,122.46, you are there with the rise of hands whose been injured playing another sport whose been into before probably all that he be pretty lucky if you hadn't been into at any stage 
122.76,133.14, things from those injuries as any one had a long term problem for many those injuries that may be they might be out to run any more or tapaderos
134.43,153.6, but not right said certainly played a role in what we gonta about coming up next with her first segment is head and spinal injuries now we had an instance this year that we all would have heard about said case where rubefacient became important pagan
153.69,181.65, in a sad tale really a man was the person in question jordan maclaine who come up and a strange shortly he was given seven weights for this lifting tackle and it really hit the headlands roars and is probably one of the things that was the most talked about in sport injuries this year now caroline ere i guess the later in rome nor what goes on there is do you think the onerous one of the most aristoteles
181.74,214.23, all depends on what stilling a lot of our work is about recording injuries for carrying people so people are going get medical treatment whether it's at a hospital or a sportsman as in and when you ran a espartero the number of cases football always to the west but it depends on what state ran her in queensland and strike me leg i hear in new south wales and ruthenian offering the southern states its straining football and one of the reasons for their dissembling because we have siminor papal playing the sport not necessarily that it's more risky
214.32,250.11, but certainly when we look at severe injuries though so those that are more severe that required paper get more medical attention because of the olive or long term disability risks we would find that the heavy context sports such as the robes would be the ones that have hieratic of heaven spare injures in the different codes can i guess bright madeleine's by code it important to realize that a ladies instancing the incidents now accidents because there is a reason why they occurred you know eccelentissima that something just happened by chance
250.17,297.3, so when we look at injury incidents and again of king at the hospital cases probably about five per cent of all cases of sport endres tradin the hospital city at tedworth concussion in sport or is suspected concussion now our research in victoria as years actually showing that the number of cases has gone up by that sixty per cent over the past ten years but we actually are seen that is a good news story because we believe that it's not because the sports are getting riskier its cothope and more concerned about it another if they don't do something they may be they can have problems so it is really reflecting hard power of the improvements in medical treatment that people at marketing he that throatiness of course with ireland your word with a poolhall club mark what happens
297.36,298.98, a head
299.04,313.86, well the mining tax that the brain gets with the head buried rotational forces within the confines of her form scales the thinking is an knowin really actually nose what
313.86,342.3, the mechanism or cause of the term concussion but it so to be the rotational forces of the brain case some sort of cognitive in payment of brain function if you you actually scan bransome who suffer concussion they look normal with bitter technology developing their are now dynamic maritandis trying to pick up subtleties but when not there yet so at the moment there is no
342.42,379.5, structural damage to the bride on a scan its more by functional in payment as a result of these rotational forces of the bride is there a man all had not a bad is that worse when you classidas it worse when you hinted on the ground from a holiday that year it is hard to define as a general rule hitting the hat on the ground where were a moving head hit he move object like the ground is worse than two heads coloring penelope of the impact of two individuals is not always at a very high speed
379.53,392.94, and you might see an example then with the bread sisser it's a double impact is usually very often an impact of the head with another player and then the head its the ground
393.12,414.0, often when the pier is already unconscious and like the head on the ground in an unconscious state which just makes the impact even worse her murmurs and more get to the bread signs incident a little bit laid to an betterin wanted to ask you what are the seriousness of concussion so that one of the short term and i guess the long term impacts
414.51,462.39, well socially immediately people are going to be having the symptoms potentially like theseus loss of memory and so forth they're not going to be feeling well and a lot of paper go to the emergency department do so because they don't feel quite right and the right to go to an emergency apartment or to sing a doctor to get sorted out the good news is that most of the symptoms of concussion der resolve over two weeks and that's why we have returned to play guide lines that say really paper should be returning to play until after then it's if you've got tom symptoms that excitat two week period that you really don't need to get more medical attention as much said occasion show up on a brain scan but there are other tests the dalmatica professionals in your position can use to look for science of long term damage
462.39,538.29, so the one that really we need to be worried about the l the american football or mislead incidents that i guess the brain bank is that any positive thing i guess i mean is what's happened is bad but sir fatetur race i think it's going to be very good for future research falchion out that a lot of that wooing it potential long time done and for something called satiric tomalin capote with the worries been identified in american studies of decayed footballers so all of the studies so tenkoruti by pathologists who looked at the brains of people died not of players who was still playing and some of that damage can actually be caused by things like drug taking alcohol violence and other abuse and so that sort of study and that evidence is actually limited because we only know that it according did people we do thee to have long tom studies having said what i've just said we don't know that it doesn't cause that demeter so really i think having a brain banksome importantly having long return prospective studies where we follow it plays who are healthy a stare on the season and the hoose who do in don't have concussion have have not suspected but
538.59,543.21, we follow those up to look at the history overtime that's where we're going to need to go in the future
543.27,551.28, working a professional environment have at the anatolia where may be doctors are available 
551.4,554.19, there i guess that goes down the kids to
554.46,561.45, i think that the ameliorator concern and i sold the professional level again
561.48,619.59, after they get a system regular the professional athlete but at the suburban level of any sport those sort of medical services are not readily valuable so people could variation the rider suffering from the consequences of a concussion which one of the reasons why i participate in any level of sport should i suffer any top of injury by this particular case had injury to get medical attention and there are lot of education programs now sports tries for look after football clubs are generally well aware of the issues relate to concussion and we certainly get a lot of reference to assist the concussion phaidrolithos from hindrance dignities a pretty much a blank of runaway shouldn't return to sport and to have had a medical assessment
619.68,652.77, werther is the head in looking cushion because sometimes i guess that could be confused a note that's pretty simple she decided i'll go to hit a tear from a case can suffer my grand head i cannot be cast i think her a conan is a bit simplistic there a range of symptoms that we look for a cushion in it at seven one of them but as caroline said distension some short term memory loss and end the very common
652.77,678.18, that tightened out of these perportion don't feel right and that is probably a more significance they distort fill normal they fell cloudy hazy in the head they can concentrate so there are ranges of symptoms that you can suffer from with casson not just a head or go to that arm bradamanti centralist this video becaase
679.2,699.75, to and fro star bread sins is revealed grafters for his long term future following eleven serious concussions the twenty nine year old last night made a tearful farewell from his sanatogen district and in an exclusive interview with wanted reveals how serious health concerns led him to quitting the game he loves
699.96,745.83, it was this bobolinks ago that signal be in for ballarat bred sons and conscious for seven minutes it was the lightest in a string of crippling pincushions the analyst eleven pretty good ones harcombe and three of those being in the last inmates and wotton when he can hear that and look at those numbers it is it's a little scare and i do after waking up of it sistova the head knocks began when he was a youngster he even wore a helmet to appease long suffering mother and when i happened to minister and for antinomial bed begged stick in my cricket and give up footlight it was so who shed tears as he told his teammates of his decision to retire after ninety at games entered premiership
745.89,821.28, putting family before he's going to lay up the potential consequences of verses what you going to get out of playing again interpolated in the end a decision welcome by the medical profession concerned by the twenty nine year old shiner of concussions of wolfhound that with eleven he stands a much hartenstein some canaples loss of short and long term memory loss of coordination persistent had egsperts in makes there are some concern that they may develop or some of the crenelations such as parkinson's feathered by signs now a father to eight months old harper when i come to the brain from and that kind of thing you don't really get a second crack at it he suffered headaches for two weeks after the lightest hit and still has neckan he's even undergone brain skins which have cleared him of serious damage for now and at the miracle good amount to head of men you know i may play for one or two more years but hopefully i can live for the next fifty or sixty so you want to be a in amenophis ical state that you can get the most deliriously after football or in trade no news of story there are even concussions over his career and plates and poured a leaden and the crows as well caroline what are the things that plays need consider in balancing their sports create with their health
821.73,853.89, that's a very good christian particularly to the very aultoun players to think about what's going to happen to them whitecraft close the career so we donatello at that as well when we're talking about amatikita level players to those players have adrian like they might be one to work the motombo to study and how can they support their family that a less likely to be concerned for our late players because they plethory so sport sentries actually have wide ranging impact on honorarily aspects
853.89,902.01, makes a difficult decision as well we can sometimes it's a release for table but if they're getting injured and cart work i guess that's a big problem it is but i think it's certain looking too as we saw at the start of tonight sthat you can actually do cross training and very upper activities so by no means tattoo because that's not what we're talking about were talking about may be changing your training rejane balancing up playing different sports and taking some things a bit slowly but certainly maintaining activity is much better than opting anything at all preferences though probably say those incidents in the road the oils well should be concerned about these forts the way they going with these injuries and that's really good christian we've done some way connectional that shows that one in four parents stop a children from playing sport because they cared about the risks
902.31,956.22, and when you look at him particularly at his parents a voice want to stop the voice remplacante right be codes and girls seaports of girls interestedly don't want them to drouot now when you look at the injury hospitalisation statistics so sports picture highly but can tell you no way me at the level of warning for presentation to hospital i think tinware finding his parents are getting their information from watching the late forms of the game on the way in but the injury rate in community football even in the orotava the community level is about one twentieth of ariette ill and for kids is probably about one hundred cotesworth are relatively safe the key things are are to choose a sporting club that's got a very good attic and a good approach to risk management and particularly its got a highly trained credible coach he will over satins and that's the best thing that parents can do for their colford
956.34,988.17, do you think then i guess the idea is changed that you not tough any more as that change especially in professional sport if parentage i think there's a still red culture you've got to be tough to torch and the lake level of sport and in dave to be tough on me not articulate regarding dealing with injury yes there is this element of you've got a tough and out and you've got a younger rough the pine 
988.2,1072.56, you have to put an inspection you ask any for pier when i go out and play at a professional level do they go into a gain with no pain at all and there will be very few who don't have some pain somewhere but you need to differentiate between were often cartarette about good and bad him it's not so much good pine but it's not bad pansa's not necessarily injury by a brownie of king muscle from their training likes it compared to erasers injury where they cling with kind and so everybody's perception of pine is very different so it's very hard to generalize its an individual level some people i would play with pain more than others just the pronounced en i mean sadly my derstand in car in correctly from wrong is children's injuries all talking under the age of say fourteen fifteen are actually a sustaining the playground on woman i sport so again we need to put it in context that parental concern about children getting injured at a hat or organised sporting level its relatively low incidents and even the interest children do suffer are not terribly serious so the positive benefits of sport and participation and athletic experience far out way the injury risk at a head of childhood lealest
1072.92,1079.67, talking of a wanness caroline what sort of rule and the media or does the media play in raising awarenesses injuries
1080.36,1097.4, i think that we have some negative influence when the focus is on our late football is of whatever coon the way and soon else has been involved in another bump onspoken off and so forth i think that they come faulting pression of house serious and the injury risks now as macao
1097.4,1125.33, very different for like sporting community sport a late islet professional athletes there their pushing their bodies to the length of physical capability that one latrobe but for everyone else were not doing that when they've to have fun to develop schools and to be fit and healthy so i've got to take that into account angularities think and be really great as the media could focus on hook at this play at this is the one whose remindingly frame for the greatest part of the same was trying it on new roads
1125.42,1165.86, that's a challenge for pious to read to the end you can turn into positive mandate weaken i saw football of those who watched at wiscasset because he was wearing his mouth go and we'll talk about protective gelatine but that that's a rallywood example of inciting tinsel this is what happens when you don't wear a mouth go so and he was in a late professional athlete and you can use that example to teach the younger athletes so this is what you should be doing so you know i regard that as a measure of the purposive nature
