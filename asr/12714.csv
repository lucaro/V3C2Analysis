0.0,10.59, oenone
11.07,55.02, i body name is jason with andy and today we are bringing you another gamble review this is the came many to the second generation now it comes in this awesome little traveling case similar to before and appear you have the rods to a complete your stand sat up some manuals as well as returned palaceward service car cetera here lies the gambler to handle and then the screws and allan wrenched his unit piece everything together so it offered but set the superequine
55.59,106.38, now that we got the came minutest i can give you a little quick tour now this is a tool is design which is awesome in very welcome the only thing that you would actually need is a quarter for the little quarter twenty screw on the bottom and an almanac to set up the stand but otherwise carrying around this you know a longer netta right so the first things first you'll notice that all these norms are now tools and design you can go ahead and unscrew any adjustments you need and the cage now comes with quick release playhouse in the top that used to be a hindrance on the first version
106.68,133.2, now you can set it up to the point where when you push your came right to the edge of wherever it is that you have a balanced you now know that it is going to be balanced every time therefore making set up the lot faster now the same thing also applies from the first version you have these four batteries and set of one big libate block and i of course goes in the exact same way
133.5,137.61, scrub's portions one has a spring tip
137.82,144.15, and one doesn't the one that has the spring and you are going to want the flat side that having contact with it
144.54,148.53, have the flat side facing out
151.83,159.06, saint and then on the other side have the flat side facing in
159.9,162.0, the power build
166.92,169.35, there you have it
171.54,180.33, all right so a quick look at how you can bounce this gamble basically from up here we got the yawl bar adjustment
180.51,185.88, and the unscrew back here lies you to adjust the role for the gamble
187.08,189.54, now what's really neat
189.9,209.7, if these two nobs upper depending on how you twist them you can actually move this bottom part of the cage up and down which is awesome you just need to make sure you loosen these little screws a little bit because they do lock it in place and then the last part is of course is having the quick release lighter plate that allows to move
209.79,211.92, forwards and backwards
212.22,220.98, all right so after you're done balancing your camera on to the cabinet you just got to give it a little test so tells it off the side say
223.02,225.06, and down stairs
225.69,255.99, all right so a first things of the bad after putting this together there's just two things and one of them is about to be fixed is the stand is a little bit short on the top rail as i betake a look here to the side you'll notice that the control box here pretty much as really really close so they're going to be fixing back here real soon another thing that we noticed when we were balancing it with the seven as was that the at seven as had a tendency to rotate
256.29,276.36, in the quick release play now we suspect it's because the screw was just a little bit longer than it needs to be so is probably just a bad batch but to something worth mentioning right soon to turn it on can go through the fierucoloni
276.78,278.07, and down
278.16,282.96, profile to follow left and right
283.05,285.6, do not follow up and down
286.2,288.06, the
288.15,292.74, his completely locked off no matter what you do
293.79,303.42, we didn't load a profile for but we go to profile five or inverted mode left hand over the top close to the remote one two three four five
303.69,305.28, goes limp
305.67,310.68, and there we go we are now an inverted boat
311.94,315.39, so let's get this span and will show you some test potage
316.29,404.16, i ain
404.79,493.29, i ain
493.5,525.12, moreno i do see the fudge was in too bad but i want to say that we didn't really go in and find to the profile a little bit so i could probably smooth out justice smith but otherwise straight out of the box is actually not that bad the inverted mode is definitely something that i think a lot of people will gravitate to because it does a really good job when it's operating in inverted out
525.21,578.04, now that being said the came many two comes in at about a thousand dollars and the fact that it's a tool assign is very welcome because it just seems like you know if you have to use a tool set to set up again boletes days it's pretty much dismissed off the bat so this having a tool asesino one that definitely works very well is great and like i said again this top bar here if you have it sent to a specific ends than all you really need do is attached camera have it hit exactly where it needs to be up against his plate and then your pretty much sat all the time now again this is a smaller gamble which means the motors are as strong as the bigger ones so you're against ill not going to be able to use very heavy lenses yorba going to be confined to these merriless lenses that are generally smaller
578.49,595.29, and again you do have this round part on the top page so if you're land exceeds that part you're probably going to have to either balance or gamble without the top cage or you know you just simply have unusual or lines
595.65,613.35, and then lastly i would say if your merriless shooter with age four and seven series or black magic pocket in a macomer than this is definitely something that you can consider if you need something just to get him study shots
614.61,625.86, anapaestic or is the sight
