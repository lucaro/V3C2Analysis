527.34,532.47, no norman there are so many that are out there
532.53,548.64, but i feel that in so much of our society what happens is we give percent of the attention to the percent of those people that are not good people in the sense that there always creating a problem are there causing a rosiere trying to do is foe
548.64,561.06, on that percent that does most of the work but rather than talk about it grip about it for about a they just do it they're good men it ended the shame of the man that's exactly right

790.74,797.01, all this time and all this work and all this effort there is probably more
797.46,812.91, in our country to day not only between races but as you said religious entities and knowledge sort of thing it seems like rather than getting closer together where we're getting farther apart you know it's interesting you mention that because
813.27,816.57, is so true and people will say
817.26,823.83, this is good let's have another social event or social program but normal problem that we've run into is
824.22,844.29, what we eat on man made way to try to solve manmade proletariat were being on is the fact that jesus christ is the answer now you may worship him under one of who knows how many labels that but that is the answer that is the focus because i i have become an avid

861.24,885.54, increasing when you have had many of the great revival people never seem to bring the forefront of that it the social ills just suddenly began to disappear over night so this is what we're trying to do to martin that racial area and the ethnic areas to say social programs that are man made always will leave out a key factor and as christ sorely that this is an effort
886.14,905.97, the banner of the christian faith to bring people together attention and some apolitical friends even knows i like to get involved in politics every once in a while but probably disagree with tutor of a sort of yarn for the day when we don't have

1200.84,1210.89, starting at two o'clock there will be churches from all over this community and people who not affiliated with churches but who believe in the sanctity of life who will be simply standing
1212.39,1213.59, silent
1213.95,1215.81, message with a sign
1216.35,1218.6, the shoulder
1218.81,1234.86, stretching from maine in nor street all the way probably to the loop later we went to the lowe had some spaces here and there but this year i am hearing reports of particularly some of the country churches literally bringing people in by the band load this time so there's going to be a large involvement
1235.13,1240.41, just get here in dotipole who feel so strongly about an issue
1240.92,1273.23, they will be lad shoulder to shoulder from main street all the way out to the loop that incredible nor was bring into fact that these are people who believe in the sanctity of life but they also believe that you need to take a stand in a way that would be respectful that would be decent and decent and in order as god's word says they're not the kind that the crash clinics they don't do anything wrong they don't even shout as matter of fact that southseaman of fact we really caution them that should
1273.23,1277.1, people who protest against them to take an opposite stand
1277.22,1290.42, can get pretty ugly unfortunately those are not shown by the media but should they be there to simply ignore them we are there with a message of peace by i'm so glad this is being done and is being done in this manner because
1290.9,1321.59, a very important message and i think and i guess it's true with any movement there are always a few frame elements that can do some stupid things and and destroy a whole movement and and that's almost happened with the police movement you've got some guy carrying signalised and there got a guaranteed me up the whole movement these are people who with
1321.74,1322.88, simply
1323.45,1336.35, standing there saying to the public this is what we believe you know what is tragic about that is as we were mentioning earlier i think even of the camera the media so often keys on the negative
1336.47,1341.36, they do not see i could name them organization after organization that have done
1341.54,1347.12, hundreds helped hundreds and thousands of young ladies everywhere from california to the east coast
1347.63,1362.54, the doing it quietly it does not bring attention does not bring media they are going in and counseling we are constantly challenged with people saying well you want them to not aboard a child that is quoted not wanted which that is a total
1362.72,1372.62, of the facts but what is the alternative well as recently as two months ago i spoke with an adoption counsellor for a
1373.01,1401.15, this area that she told me she says i have no problems finding families for baby she said the problem we have is finding babies that people want to give up so there are planets
1401.63,1485.84, not a protest as it's a demonstration in the sense of being a positive demonstration you're not going to distrain or anything like that you even tell it something to day that i really respected that is if there's a besserer that the people not lined up in front of you there are business you won't do that and that happened last year and not only that but we got one step further and each church supplies their own housefronts
1485.96,1489.17, organizations that are involved with also
1489.17,1501.47, maintenant a person to charge the organization will fall involved too is well annonciation because last year meredithian best
1501.5,1520.97, i pressed a lot of different churches represented but it be true that sixty six different churches will be represented it looks like death nineteenth is an anesthetic
1521.87,1527.48, the various churches in town combined forces
1527.93,1535.1, to accomplish something decent thing churches doing this absolutely in the person who really she
1535.1,1562.97, has not as for any credit but i'm going to give it and that's much peddler who got gave this burden she took the ball she ran with a sheet has been very courageous as you well know any time you take a stand funny things began to happen and unusual things and there have been times of trial time of stress david well has been very instrumental in helping as well as have many others but that he was really one that god did the vision to first and had the courage to run with it and i really respect her for that
1563.48,1567.56, alison's all over with
1568.37,1569.96, and
1571.07,1573.38, there would be much came
1573.86,1606.65, could you look back and say this is what we have come to yes i think they editress conference and many people got there came to the press conference and talk about how they benefit when we got through we had opportunity to share it just the main fact alive as well while in a positive peaceful way which as an opportunity for someone else to say he may be i'll take a second thought about made the portion of my bottom and so i thought that that was a atelier nothing else but the fellowship that we had to go standing says
1607.07,1616.55, nothing else breaking their many churches together in a united effort is a something like a small mercantini this town would be like
1617.06,1620.42, a what this town would be like
1620.78,1625.64, throughout the year sixty something churches
1625.73,1642.02, forces of said were going to accomplish this and this and this and this for you talking about a monteforte i'd be for that the reconciliation is all about so that's why they rallied
1642.08,1686.78, and again the times the rate monteventi in the speaker is that anthony anastasius francesco in as hermonthis not a money making adventure or children come reconciliation on economical
1687.23,1693.11, to respect the people who are making their statement
1693.29,1704.48, always a tendency if you don't agree with somebody to hope and to fear and to make stupid gestures and things like that these are people who care enough
1704.84,1708.71, get out and try to make our society better
1709.01,1748.1, so respect them all there out there or are we saying we got one minute to lee and to its all over with not a rap up i mean this is it this is it we are going to give away a beautiful set of earrings thanks to my dear friend chris a starving fabulous artist and said eglinton mendelian get bob is a good topgallantmast ronaninhohonti
