1.41,34.62, no i hate that cat how many times have you heard this pennies now taste is one thing you can have the use of a particular technic if you want but like every form of art you are in to try to understand it to understand why it is here and what is its purpose if you won your criticism to be accepted or even valid now it is true that the use of shaky camp has been popularized the best ten years or so but where does it come from why would the direct or photography specifically used this way of filming instead of google critically acclaim tracking shot
34.77,294.84, the reasons but first i want to put aside the very low budget movies there is a point in the process of making a film when you have to set a budget and singer is expensive though the amount of dear wives and cheap alternatives is getting bigger and bigger with people making formidable pieces of machinery preceptorial but most of the short intimate videos shushan again choose this particular technique because it's cheaper even though making a good shake shot takes some gear too if you wanted to be watchful and digital stubble ization or shakes on not really going to help you with that now some movies have to use an instable point of view let's take the spanish movie wreck a record from however i gerontological supposed to be lost said from jousting to survive the horrors happening in a building full of wealth we have people sailest here the shaky games the immersion because it portocarrero the cameraman tries to have as many natural reactions as he can while trying to tell story infective because even though his baling for his life his character has to keep filling for the people outside to witness would happened it's porfis jar and repeated to us many times it understandable that people can have a physical reaction of uneasiness in front of it but it serves the story now let's get to the reason why in discussing this pureness and all the hay he received greenness the director of the bodily well most of it which has the reputation of being the king starter of the shaky content while first it is not understand that the first one were thrown by the nipple top most opportunities and scenes were the perfect example of sheikabad gives us this sense of presence and urgency this is why i in some respects appreciate the technique in the bonmots green grass which was a direct fourteenth himself this question how to make the audience feel that this character is so smart so trained and fast but they can't keep up with him the constant use of sakyamuni the camera is not only moving in shaking it has trouble following the action i think the point is to mimic how you and i would react in the situation how overwhelmed werwolfery a constant flow of information and that talking about the plot which is not that complicated and talking about the general thinking process of the character how he will manage to get out of a situation not taking the time to explain to you how he did it it gets to a point when during conversations the camera losson the characters of focussing where shone now petersen a former siege with the brain working at top speed all the time how do you think your fox would work it is true that the use of shayan's not imitate itself to the character of jason worn but most of the characters are either dressed in a hurry or completely lost which are emotional states that happened to match their shaken style too in my opinion last seemed to be praising this type of filming but i am not and i think my complaints are the same as the rest of you i hate shaky cans in movies where shakalasha no proper reason to be what was for me poor bringas's film making is that his themes and his characters are functioning with this time not saying that these movies are flawless but there is justification for use of the technique and it is being used from beginning to end which is very important the problem lay in the movies will you have dialogues filled on a tripod movements filmed with a dalliant of pursuits filmed with a shade can in a film where you are passive witness the camera has absolutely no reason to lose foresail something else than the characters except maybe of the context calls for it like in saving private right for example this method can be used when we have a reason to be enabled to follow the action but two persons punching insolent face for faces is not something you needling shots for especially in the age of the demies were sometimes already confusing enough for marionettes is my opinion but i love to hear yours and not his tattersalls
