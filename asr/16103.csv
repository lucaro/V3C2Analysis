0.66,9.57, he
11.1,24.42, one
29.58,34.98, the tenth in a series of programs to you by the members of indivisible south bay
35.19,36.69, for
37.56,45.12, and so i can valley indivisible south bay is comprised of average citizens like the three of us here
45.18,48.6, very concerned about the trumpet and
48.66,50.82, what it's doing to our democracy
51.18,58.41, we're at a particular crisis moment where that's concerned so that will be the main topic of our discussion to night
59.22,62.91, usual if this show makes you want to get out of your chair
62.97,66.21, take action than we will have accomplished something
66.75,73.17, however we are also concerned about the psychological toll that
73.17,85.77, agenda and his actions are taking on all of us as activists and we want to discuss that and not just as activist just average citizens so we'll discuss that at the end of the show
87.78,110.43, so all introduce our panels a tom fenton will be familiar to any one who's been watching this program he's a tack entrepreneur and executive co director of indivisible south bay and a leader in different activists and electoral groups and silicon valley for decades including silicon valley for a boma and the democratic volunteer center
110.85,119.91, were very pleased to welcome are tuttle to our show for the first time he is a veteran of the army infantry in the one hundred first airborne division
120.12,124.08, i see you nurse and a member of indivisible south bay
124.2,134.7, to both of you sessile dive into this topic at hand which is how donald trump is basically dismantling our democratic system
135.33,152.22, what would you say is the most concerning for you at this moment about what trump is doing i would say my biggest concern or the attacks of the independence of the department of justice in our system of government we've always had a wall between the politics and
152.22,158.55, the law enforcement and what we're seeing is trump is just tearing down that wall
158.82,167.31, he just said this past week on the white house lawn i know i'm not supposed to get involved with the department of justice but
167.34,205.65, need to be looking at hillary clinton and the democrats and that deeply concerning the old trump is also the first candidate at least of my lifetime and i believe in our history as a nation who has suggested that his opponent the investigated in jail that is not normal behavior for our government that's not how we do things i also see the attacks on his own attorney general jeff sessions which are related to his refusal from the russian investigation he's been undermining and humiliating his own attorney general and lastly i would say that the attacks on robert muller rubber mallers an american hero he is a vietnam veteran
205.8,218.19, is the winner of a bronze star with a valor device and also a purple heart he was also appointed to take over the bi after nine eleven to turn it into a counter intelligence institution
218.4,230.82, so robert muller is he is well respected he is served under both republican and democratic administrations and he's someone who you know is above reproach
230.82,307.71, i think that you've said a lot and it's true that it's shocking every time i hear trump talking about muller and he's actually trying to foment some kind of attack on muller by saying people are saying people are very very angry at the miller investigation and it's just it's incredible that we're hearing this the situation with firing james come where initially the story to the to the country was well you know i took the advice of rosenstein and nepenthe the one who told me we needed to fire came and then a couple of days later as he reviewed from envy and says you know i got it tired of this investigate this rushing stuff and aforetime to find me the decision to fire come it assumes to me that that that that so egregious it's out there but that's trumps mode of operation let me put it out there in daranato do anything about it kindred attack on a nation's history we only had one other fire that was fired and that was four cause
307.86,321.48, and his name actually happened to be sessions as well william sessions he was fired in nineteen ninety three by president clinton but it was for cause he was four egregious uses of taxpayer funds and fraud and so he was really disguise that reason
321.51,336.66, that's what makes the coloring so unprecedented is that it was not for causally shocking in a tone a anthropon ent of this dismantling of our timocracy that you want to talk of it love
336.69,392.52, for one thing the judiciary his attacks on the division is attempts to invalidate and really throw doubt over the legitimacy of the judiciary the example i can think of was that even during the campaign when there was this indian judge of mexican descent who issued a ruin that was not in his favor and he immediately heautontimorumenos country and is justly unacceptable either some other examples of what as well there are other some disturbing examples of him referring to the judiciary as a laughing stock and a joke in tweeds and also when the muslim band rolling came down donald trump tweeted out
392.61,411.78, if there was a terrorist attack on american soil that the blood on the hands of the judge who issued this day and that you know as i said let me count the ways there is also his repeated and an unceasing attack on the free press
411.81,543.3, even the words that he uses are echoes of very troubling history of for example he came out with a phrase the press is the enemy of the people that's forbade from the rise of fascism in the twentieth century and if that didn't scare the bateses out of most people in this country is very discouraging the attacks on canon for example these are not just attack these are bitter in inciting to violence the tweet to be had of the locomotive running over smotherin people there something where he was punching out someone who thistians conciliation the free press and frankly the only entity within the free press that has been pretty unrelenting in in response because i guess they figure they have nothing nothing to lose but his monitories and his continued campaign to discredit the free press is a direct attack while i will say an indirect attack on the constitution i am also very concerned about the direct attacks on the constitution on constitutional rights so for example the president in united states part of his oath of office is so protected the fen the united the constitution of the united states in that includes protecting a defending the rights of americans the rights of human beings not just americans and if you look at his history starting with with charlottesville with the way he reacted after the murder of the protestants
543.33,585.66, on the same side he waited the torch bearing white supremacies whose sole objective was to proclaim other people like us they don't count the matter they don't have rights when you start belittling the rights of people or not the white supremacy it is a direct attack the constitution and going to pardoning the sheriff or pile here is a guy who has been convicted of violating court orders to enforce civil rights he is actually violating the civil rights of individuals turned out that they were latin and other minorities and which trumped was he said
585.87,664.71, it's not just a wink and a nod this is it's okay you don't amenities not only sanction its encouraging and embracing it to my mind that is it's absolutely herenden his speech in july to law enforcement of the sheriff's along island where he of course he's trying it on your friend in a good guide pinkwink this time there was the wing where he says you know what when you've got a suspect that you're going to put them in your car you don't need to be too nice to me yeoman in all a little bit to my i think about that and this is timersome cop show where the earth you're actually looking at rob cops but no this is the president of the united states it is just it my boy but he's stillinghast all the time and it's actually taking a page out of a dictator's lay book i find absolute police said does bidding absolutely when it circumvented the rule of law absoluteness eilithyia bein unpacked out for us it's very concerning
664.77,685.62, so what we've heard is that donald trump would like to develop his own global spy networks use me with a prince who is the founder of black water this is very disturbing because essentially what he's saying is it that he does not entrust our own american intelligence community so that's a huge issue right there secondly the major issue with this is that
685.62,698.49, old trump would be asking these agents to be loyal to him as a person in the military in the intelligence community these americans were swearing oath to the country into the constitution
698.67,713.52, this would be completely and of the that our mentality is as americans and this would be very dangerous the other concerning thing is that this this sounds like an extension of military contractors like we saw in iraq in afghanistan
713.73,724.59, the problem with that is the average person probably isn't aware that when the us military deploys into a theater we are bound by the uniform code of military justice which is a
724.71,735.33, a set of rules there are essentially laws which guide your behavior of how you're supposed to behave as a soldier in a theatre of war well what we found with these contractors especially
735.33,743.52, like black water is that they were bound by no laws whatsoever there not in the military so that the uniform cometary justice does not apply
743.67,824.1, they're not on american soil so american laws don't apply and the countries that were invading have no government or judicial system to where to charge somebody with a crime and ineffectually there completely unregulated and in fact you know talking about eric prince you forgot to mention alderworth who is yet another sign example of somebody who thumbs his nose that the constitution is involved that anyone with this as well and there really is speaking of bathos of the past there is an echo to my mind of fallen his say his brown church that he had doing his violent dirty work for him independent of any law enforcement even before he rose to power the one he did rise to power his essay was independent of the military and the police it was a separate entity loyal to after and then stevensoniana consolidation of power this is what we see when any autocrat or dictator takes over
824.22,988.74, he began by winning an election sometimes they can be sabotaged but they start off by winning an election they start to take over and then they start to erode the mechanisms of checks and balances if you just look at all the institutions that donald trump is already attacked the free press the american intelligence community he's attacking the department of justice he's attacking truth i mean this is all very dangerous in this is exactly what we would see an autocrat instrumental about attacks on our small democracy not as democrats or republicans but as concerns citizens of leighton so wood as our recourse for these terrible things that are happening right now or what is what is your impression of what we can do when considerations look at impeachment as the constitution was developed in the federalist papers number sixty five alexander hamilton described the subject of impeachment as those offenses which proceeded from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust they are fanatic may be particular proprietario be be denominated political and he capitalized the word political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself this is alexander hamilton one of our founding fathers it turns out that there were other comments that were similar one by james madison responding to inelasticity itself that we're talking about political offenses not necessarily criminal offenses the words in a sense you know trump is smoergasbord of offences and so mellering into the criminal offences we have so many other offences that he's committing and i think it citizens we need to be vocal about all of it anastatia's one of the reasons i think we're here today so in terms of impeachment i've heard
988.83,995.73, members of congress that we have approached with you know why aren't you talking about impeachment a lot of them have said
995.76,1014.42, waiting for muller to issue his incitements and we're just waiting and that hasn't seemed fully appropriate response and i wonder what you both think about that i mean should we be saying should we as citizens be saying more and should our members of congress be saying more
1014.51,1046.64, that's vertical question because indeed yes of course we should and in fact we are our group individual south has been very active in our engagement with our members of congress and the intention
1046.64,1055.94, our representatives not displaying the same sense of urgency it's a bit returned like judging from
1055.94,1057.59, history
1057.71,1077.15, you know because you have more of a historical perspective a water gate and the different you know impeachments that have occurred well in water getting wasn't an actual impeachment it was it would be so in a sense i'm asking you to look at history and say
1077.36,1202.43, are we just waiting for moller can we caesar just waiting for oleanders of congress i won't say they're being disingenuous perhaps they're in denial in reality because impeachment is an inherently political process and the constitution explicitly it doesn't use the idolatrous from office has everything to do with public opinion and if you take a look at particularly intricate i remember personally that was when i was younger and much more fiery than i am now and much less patient i had the sense leading up even in nineteen seventy four thinking that this was never going to happen that nicolas going to survive because the republicans were just two apologetic too much in nixon's pocket and then his approval ratings began to go south and by the time they reached twenty eight per cent they went below thirty per cent you saw the republicans peeling away making the political judgment at the taconet survive his survival so they made the judgment that unless they came out for his removal that they themselves would be removed by the voters and i expect that you can get a similar phenomenon now which to my mind makes it all that much more important that we raise our voices publicly and use all the tools at our disposal and i would say that even more than water gate where in a sort of reality taminent where trump is marshaling the forces of opposition with fox news you know he basically owns that entity to do his bidding to trumpet his message so with that environment it's all the more important for people in opposition to speak out as
1202.55,1209.57, a large group of people we have chapters of indivisible and we're just one of the
1209.6,1252.59, says of the protest movement so i am actually saying it rhetorically you know what can we do i know there's a lot we can do and we will do it in the coming months but eric before we move on to the next part of it in the ouave anything to say about how imperative do you think it is that we all speak i feel like that we have to lead i don't understand the reluctance of some of our members of congress to be more vocal about it and i think that the forecast and the butterfly
1252.86,1262.34, i could win a put it actually so i think we've all agreed that we are you know we're really
1262.76,1290.21, needing to protest but at the same time sometimes we feel a little bit distempered just because there's this constant barrage of stuff coming at us from trump and his cronies and the tea party and just one after the other it's unbelievable tenacity
1290.36,1401.99, keep focus on what we need to do here you have any thoughts about that either of you i can tell you personally how i respond and i won't claim to be representative but what i say i think i would advise people to think in these terms many people are beaten down by the generalisation easthagen more energy on my part i also keep in mind and i've said this in previous shows in many respects trump is the gift that keeps giving and what do i mean by that i mean that this this is an unprecedented present precedented presidency on many fronts one of them being the trumps compulsive and many of the things that he does generates that kind of response and energy what we have seen in the last year the rise of indivisible swing left sister district together we will there has been a huge increase in engagement on the part of people who feel the outrage and trump is going to continue to motivate us and we need we need to take the energy that that he tries to generate to put down in us that needs to to energize us and i feel energized i feel interfare breed and has i think a lot of us we do feel burst of energy at a moment staring this past so eleventh of chaos and catastrophe but there have been moments where we feel fairly deflated and just depressed about the situation soaked
1402.62,1409.52, i think eric maybe you can speak to that as a nurse as someone who who handles people in
1409.52,1416.57, emotional trauma and as an infantry you know a man france veteran maybe you can speak to this
1416.69,1430.79, well i think it's interesting that donald trump basically bragged that he wanted to have the first reality t presidency and with that just an all out assault on our senses from twitter to the four new cycle face book
1430.94,1449.42, we're finding that we can't get away from politics no matter where we go with that sports the n i mean it just seems like politics is encompassed everything in our lives and that can be overwhelming and i'm seeing signs of kind of that fatigue and burn out that i also seeing friends and other acts and so
1449.57,1469.25, you know we have to find ways to be able to recharge our battery and i think for me personally one of the things that i need to do is to turn off the social media to turn off the television to get away from the constant over stimulation because it's not good for most people to continue that over and over again
1469.4,1511.52, i just think that we're all being pushed to our limit and we have to find ways to connect and come together find support within the community find friends to talk to find things to do or you can kind of get a little break from the politics because we're running attaineth with friends don't make it all about tramp or not the latest disaster you know try to change the subject every now and then and my husband reminds me of that too so i think we've we've come up with some pretty good ideas you know just for basically how to stay sane but then i'll turn it around and say once you've had that decompression
1511.76,1512.96, remember
1512.99,1520.46, you know that we are under attack are democracy is under attack and then to take the basic first step
1520.46,1563.18, coalescing with like minded friends and neighbors and forming a group it can be a group of five people that decide that you're going to call your congress person together or you're going to campaign for a particular candidate together or something you know we worked on alabama we worked on the albemarle as a group of about a local citizens we made some phone calls and for the end aviola and it was tremendously energizing actually slouch i suggest that people could do to not only feel better but feel like they're making a difference
1563.18,1571.79, you both suggests that will probably be our closing question to day i think one of the things that help bring it back to me is finding
1571.79,1576.95, to volunteer in the community i find that if i can start to help people
1577.04,1598.4, i can make a difference locally i think until we start to change you know who some of our legislators are and who are elected representatives are you know we're a little lieutenant to organize and we can continue a pressure on them but i think you know unconnected with the commanding
1598.61,1699.62, i also think it's really important to have a good perspective what do i mean by that there is an expression that the antidote to despair is action or does that really mean i'll tell you how i interpreted when you you feel beaten down by something or the potential to be beaten down the most healthy response is to stand up and say i'm going to do something but it's really important not to be wedded to the outcome and that means when you do something you should not think that if you fail at it somehow it's a waste of time because it's never a waste of time taking action and being involved in engaged is a form of self medication of self of care and that in itself makes you healthier and better able to deal with the vicissitudes of life that come with a donald trump and whenever going to stop fighting were never going to stop being active and no matter what the outcome the process is what matters and we can reinforce that in one another as we are active and we do our activism and there's really nothing like that that the sense of of engagement and in community that yet by doing that enery time with great people like the two of you i can say well that's all the time we have for our program thanks very much for joining us to find out more about indivisible south bay you can go to indivisible south bay door or our facade
1699.62,1706.97, thanks again and let's all try to say strong stay active and stay connected
1707.33,1709.4, again and the next time
1720.71,1742.82, each of these half hour panel discussions we will highlight a different aspect of our group sharing ideas stories and best practices with the overall goal of showing the public that average citizens like us can take effective action to enact true change in our society
1742.88,1767.63, he
