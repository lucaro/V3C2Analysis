0.0,25.77, i been fortunate that i've been able to do consistently explore the things that are most interesting to me about my life and life in general and those of that's what i found amat
26.7,50.4, what i look at my study and i tempt to understand through my traps and my books are usually when i am making a wicious looking at something that corresponds with the emotional suspicion i might have had or a whiff of
50.7,52.86, some kind of intuition or something
53.13,61.47, sometimes it might be in ice cold correspondents to specific thought i take pictures for a lot of different reasons
61.47,63.87, i feel a lot of different things that i'm taking
64.59,78.57, i'm working in berlin by night and something about brilliant night that's one set of feelings i work out a book on the gibson guitar with tanysiptera harpar and so i thinking about my relationship to the instrument ever since i was a boy
78.84,98.46, so you can't really answer that question with a specific answer in various maneuvering i am influenced by culture in general i think if you want to be a tigerish etre literature and music and languages
99.09,100.23, like that
100.26,105.96, for that reason i love for the groping in the older culture in europe things like that
106.38,114.75, so i am totally influenced i mean i can study i can study the subjunctive and french and fine that it influences away i see something
115.95,117.63, that's
117.72,122.94, then i want to live i want to i want all my activities to integrate into one totality
123.48,124.92, that sense
125.88,134.22, why the guitars are never off i'm always advancing that while i'm advancing a book idea while i would dancing light understanding of something else
134.58,139.08, it's the highest form of satisfaction that i have ever experienced
139.2,148.77, allowing that can this is sort of man by god here
151.08,159.3, easier my misgotten i'm in the dark room making a print looking at the first print of a strong image
159.87,165.51, knowing that i participated see i don't really feel that i am to music
165.99,169.17, just sort of like the radio through which the music plays
169.38,173.22, i feel as if we tolerate which photography speaks
173.58,176.31, and at such moments when i
177.3,180.66, in the making of a strong image
180.78,182.61, it has an 
182.64,191.55, a powerful spiritual track city attached to it a sense of self reflection and the kind of introspection that can be trusted 
194.25,195.69, otherwise
197.46,203.58, i like to consider that my personal perceptive act no matter what i'm looking at is the subject of the photograph
204.27,208.14, for that reason i only foisting i'm interested in in one of photograph
208.95,210.78, when you have that point of view
210.84,243.18, i feel that way about your work you can't really be available for commercial signature use of finest equipment that you can buy and not on us a lot of it and i'm not technically dependent on 
243.48,248.73, a lot of effect in that regard i want just to be point blank
249.09,250.5, they could
251.61,253.23, i'm trying to do
253.44,255.0, tried to refine that
255.72,270.18, as part of my technique i continue to try and find a young photographer i would fatally suggest no point to ever
270.57,272.55, emulate copy
272.79,274.47, photograph you admire
274.68,275.91, to be learned
277.17,278.61, to be living for that
279.15,281.28, successful photographs ready to copy
281.58,282.96, analyze
283.44,286.47, deceptively simple in that regard
286.98,292.05, braid photography is physical fact slash psychic effect
292.14,296.37, a mere physical fact have such powerful psychic effect
296.4,303.51, well the mission caution is the is the vision of the practitioner of the photographer
303.99,305.1, he
305.25,311.49, was what brought that home to light and you can't really
311.67,314.13, get anywhere imitating somebody else's work
315.66,318.54, now if you want to be commercial photography you can
319.71,324.78, commercial photographs do do fumography to make money
326.19,328.77, photographer named money to make phonographs
328.77,331.32, entirely different approach the media
331.8,333.15, so
333.66,342.57, if it is he working professionally and certain photographers look is hot at the time well then you just knock off that look and
342.66,344.13, they do 
346.02,348.39, but if you're serious about the medium
349.23,354.27, i think that i could try and do as your own thing a passerby lucky feeding it to do that
355.56,369.48, you have your best chance knocking off yourself better anybody else on the lookout for failure
369.54,372.54, more from my failures in from my successes
372.69,374.94, prior to realizing that
375.39,379.14, i might have misinterpreted that phenomenon as frustration
379.95,381.81, the truth is that
381.84,386.91, truth is that the pictures i make it a success successful don't really teach me anything
387.03,393.27, satisfied i please but the ones that are not successful are the ones that inform my subsequent efforts
394.08,395.28, always
395.34,412.68, to be a photographer still want to be one if i'm alive years from now i can tell you that's still be oneidas with i don't know what i would do if it weren't for polarity i might be a musician
412.86,416.31, it meant so many things in the course of my life but
417.6,422.37, i know i know that as long as my work is going well everything else falls into place
423.18,427.98, everything
429.24,431.67, tell me is there a god
