15.06,28.95, so the first thing i want to do is talk about what we just saw there the security council just finished its regular monthly meeting on minimises is the first meeting like that that i attended and i have to say it was a bitter
29.28,35.22, security council is supposed to discuss how to maintain international peace security
35.55,37.59, arion the middle east
37.59,46.14, discussion when not about his illegal build up a rocket and began it was not about the money and weapons oranside to terrace
46.2,49.17, it was not about how we defeat isis
49.35,56.91, it would not about how we hold the shares accountable for the slaughter of hundreds and thousands of civilians
57.27,64.65, no and said the meaning focused on criticizing israel the one true democracy in the money
64.71,71.34, i am no round here but on her stand as how the council has operated month after month for decades
71.4,90.18, here to day the united states will not turn a blind eye to this any more i hear underscore the iron clad to port of the united states for israel i'm here to emphasize the united states is determined to stand up to the un anti israel bias
90.54,96.06, we will never repeat the terrible mistake a resolution twenty three thirty four
96.09,100.71, all one side of security council resolution to condemn israel
100.89,106.44, ben we will push for action on the real threat we face in the middle east
106.68,120.6, and for we support a solution to the israeli palestinian conflict that is negotiated directly between the two parties as president trumpeter ted in his meaning with primmins er netah yesterday
120.75,126.21, the outrageously biased resolutions from the security council and the general fembly
126.21,128.46, make peace harder
128.55,133.17, by discouraging one of the parties from going to the negotiating table
133.32,140.97, incredibly the un department of political affairs has an entire division devoted to palestinian affairs
141.06,158.67, imagine that there is no division devoted to legal missioners from north korea there is no division devoted to the world number one state sponsor of terror ran the prejudice approach to israel palestinian issue does the peace process no favors
158.76,162.87, and it bears no relationship to the reality of the world around us
163.29,165.84, double standards are restaking
166.2,170.04, a few days ago the united states saw it unsuccessfully
170.1,180.0, have the security council condemn a terrorist attack of israel were the terrorists open fire on people waiting for a bus and then stamped others
180.45,186.51, security council would not hesitate to condemn an attack like that in any other country
186.96,188.34, not for israel
188.37,192.75, the statement was docked and a downright shame
193.35,201.84, exist in a region where others call for it complete destruction and in a world where antisemitism is on the rise
202.08,208.98, threat that we should discuss that the united nations and we continue working toward a comprehensive agreement
209.07,212.1, and israeli palestinian conflict
212.55,215.85, outside of the un there is some good to
216.09,218.28, a place in the world is changing
218.43,236.64, israel is building up new diplomatic relationship more and more countries recognize how much israel contributes to the world they are recognizing that israel is a beacon of stability and a troubled region and that israel is at the forefront of innovation entrepreneurship and technology technological discovery
237.0,249.36, it is the un anti israel bias that is long overdue for than the united states will not hesitate to be out against these vices in defense of our friends and allies israel
