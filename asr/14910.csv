109.74,129.57, we are in it let's go you want to step outside entertainer the sakay okay sam because nasally has nothing better to do
130.08,137.28, we are joining up with the sa so any sands are going to mars
137.91,154.23, that i do know you know it's you comyagua little bit i'm sorry in any case the boy is that nasrani forces in order to go to mars for future mission to master
154.59,166.17, i think is actually it's a very costly and there's been a bit of a delay in assassin roving laboratory
166.17,178.26, a science a rover and trovatore the root the yes the were not to be confused with the
178.83,209.52, laboratory the rotatory what about it anyway it's costing a lot of money which i think is why this conjunction has come up the biggest problem is right now that what bushes put a set forth is this kind of thing about not being able to throw stuff up in the air together mystification make that go
209.58,212.37, that right there is also
212.43,214.95, anyhow point is
215.22,239.28, yes hell's guy i exactly so that's kind of where that issue is right now it's kind o not really going forward it's not really going backward it just kind of isis nothing stanton right now yes thank you anything else itself
240.27,255.84, i reformation of those shows i told you we were ready to early death true adister 
256.17,279.48, feeling else no i think that's pretty much in a going to make a really great sage and then i screwed it all up but basically the seashell having a hard time pain for maybe they should not don't know do something like fire salsolaceous we sell so of course unless you been living under a rock or don't talk to people in general
279.51,282.93, would not know that massa is selling
282.93,287.22, the shuttles now
287.91,307.02, he said oh yeah i heard the shuttles they're going to be you know a museums and stuff like that and that's great and i said no there selling the shuttles boymans selling it said like forty two million dollars you know her shall we whatyoucallit that's a lot of money
308.76,342.0, she cost about one point seven billion dollar abalaine first ball be forty two million dollars is just my estimate and that includes the six million to ferito where ever the closest airport is now you live in the middle of bower it's going to be more than that exactly and trust me pickup truck isn't going to work for this thing but but then on top of that the the orders are only going to be 
342.3,365.49, they're only the only place it they're going to be allowed to be in our indoor climate controlled display area which answered my question i asked of his battered and one all by one and then i can fly my own space shall in the space as some o goin afford the five hundred million dollars to take to lunch but no healthiest part is that you have to be able to to take 
365.76,387.09, what's the word i want one something is delivered to you you deliver sure whatever he had to be able to take it all in one big chunk it's not going to be disassembled a right is what i'm trying to say the possession thank you that'll totally work for me right there i know words none of them said a boy know me anyway i yes
387.27,389.46, the big hold up with that
389.52,393.57, of course if the shuttles keep flying past twenty ten
393.57,401.07, then if you all i don't care if you've already given us forty two million dollars you can't have it i really you know
401.07,431.28, the back at of the show we're going to have a predictions for i'm going to sneak a little bit of land there as well so i think we'll touch on that a little bit in the backcloth that if you can't afford the fritillaries or something like that ilseboro round
431.34,457.2, raising it even of people can come up with forty two million courtesying on it because they prefer a sleep on a antedating a banker's only four of them to go around so we're not talking like these are just mass produce we can just make more of them or what have you but assuming you can't afford that be you still mean some sort of peace
457.53,473.04, you can get one of the main engines for anywhere between fostat would be really cool to have in the back of your car now i think it would make the coolest leg coffee table no no man all or we need like a desk
474.39,480.42, kibei wore a seen someone who stands next to no
480.51,483.54, pretty much bigger than this house are some
483.54,488.79, not going to make a very good coffee table yestreen which its
488.85,498.36, i dessay it the romans every one knows that i have very hard time with the size of things japanese go in the little bundle
498.63,505.08, organists and i can have a special engine as a coffee table i see what's wrong with this picture
506.25,579.54, moving on in open massasoit so opened as this is actually kind of a serious one because i know usually pull his crap out of my back and in a note really even cares about half of these stories that i come up with but that's why bennis giving me the first five minutes of the show to the rest of it can be his little soapbox as really you know that's really what the show should be called is ben so bosses on intra funny and surely carry anne is really what it is and the point is that there is this very serious blotters here is what it is a legion called open massed dubbed upon naomi says your nose mind as our massa and is run by people who are involved with nasai many different levels many different ways et cetera et cetera are drinking dungeon of the particulars more recent post in the bog is called we value your feedback and the very serious about this so if you have some sort of idea of what you want to do to go to mars what you want to do with
579.6,639.06, trying to avoid saying it to what you want to to think that that particular industry should do when there are two point of and what obama's transition team should be looking for looking at keeping their nose out of et cetera et cetera anything you want to say cortenaeken now out of every everything exactly what they really are sincerely looking for your feedback but which is kind of the screen chop that you had there but the open macadam thank you appreciate that where the open massacring neal though at a lot of really great information others right now the latest one is there's corporators generation discussions and activities within nessa and so i think it's one of the best places to get some of the best inside information without a being like top secret information i would die i think it's very interesting but you're not going to see this on like nest
639.06,642.24, not going to get the cushion erasure not going to know
642.63,650.28, i think if you want inside nasa information too is going to be your first stop you know that stuff and then may be open as
650.43,662.79, yes if you want like the hard core inside nessa the guys who are running the spirit but the astronaut on that board but open as you can have your voice heard
663.84,666.87, how is that any different than the form in
667.29,671.19, really who cares all right 
671.34,709.62, well dredge i think massac fight too is going to use canthaves to more information the difference is open as free to is not all to his worth every penny you should certainly buy especially for a space kearsage massac flight all to section no i don't get paid by them we don't get anything i just think it's in my unbonnet nearer on the face of the planet and i prefer anastase it's pretty and quite frankly so you that's true although have you seen they have enough to sitter you go i suggested going on there hopping on their hand on and giving them your feedback your honest feedback no matter what it is again
709.68,797.13, excuse me about anything related to asa the transition team masapo anything everything there are people who read it every single day people who comment all the time it's really kind of an interesting younger community which i think is also nice and willett
799.53,891.6, the sententiousness
895.29,905.91, and this week t a for all those wandering is set that is really hard to say it sickens
905.91,912.18, those in the room give me i have it what he thinks it stands for and that actually that picture is related
912.54,925.68, you suck you know in my funnybone was like piementelle with like a cordial oh this lease
925.95,932.37, the very go are you in charles a really obscure picture do and not just like that
933.27,980.31, all my fun taking a willoughbite stop the show now retreatants actually has been an interesting and finish from a behind the scenes and point you won't you if you go on watching live and missing like half the show why literally missing half the show went to britain we been a break for you know i realized on the man it's only about about two minutes but we've been in break for about five ten minutes ostentation
980.49,990.3, the predictions for and you wanted me to go first and you were going to play off on my prediction that is why you're going first what are your predictions for nothing's going to happen till two 
994.35,1003.65, really that was your prediction i don't know i didn't really think about it okay so all right all right so we're going to get we're going to get discovery in the air we're going to get
1006.59,1016.4, yes that's like early right on it going in the air wondering in the air
1016.76,1017.69, maybe
1018.74,1023.24, going in the air her prediction was one one twenty five
1023.9,1026.09, the going to break loose 
1026.12,1032.18, i don't know as i can teething else no honestly i don't i don't 
1032.3,1085.88, i apple by suspicions and creates a shuttle service which in my mind would be spot on perfect as ours i am concerned as lord knows they could do it faster quicker and more expensive than any one else out there then will jump the mine i think two thousand nine like you said actually is the year before the tipping point so two thousand ten is the the year everything changes in space travel is not going to be like one moment in time and two thousand but i think you know come twenty twenty twenty thirty twenty forty and we look back in time we're going to look at two thousand and ten as being a moment in time that space travel for ever changed two thousand nine is kind of that year the gears up towards that so the beginning part of two thousand nine assentingly
1085.94,1099.14, but more importantly in the private sector falconing is going to do tesla's early they're goin to kick everyone's or maybe i think what's going to happen is because it's i really do think that there
1099.14,1114.29, it might be that as it might be space as big year to shine because falcon kind of is a big deal falcon is there now in engine rocket that logistic the dragon capon top and
1114.62,1136.55, they're going to be able to do a pretty heavy loads into space so their first test is going to be from the cape actually they're going to be lunching early i think that will actually be delayed i think they're going to get it on the pad i think it going to get ready to launch her going to get right my prediction is my i'm going to be scary go down to the second in this prediction i think they're going to scrub the launch it like zero seconds
1136.73,1263.78, as i my prediction we can all come back to miss day i think there is a scrub atterson and they're going to stall i think they're going to find some sort of problem in the engine and the rest massed on historic data from space cut that's okay i think they will eventually launch and i have a feeling they're going to lose their first vehicle just going to launch and then explode but they're second vehicle i think like the first one where he took them for rockets to get up and i think it's going to retaliate on to have their donation be ready to bring human yet but it will be ready to bring cargo to the international space station and noticed the timing there two thousand times when we shut down the space enterprise if they really deportation materially get a working we don't have to rely on russia right for crew for manchester to the international space and apsaras timeline let me throw it out there right now i'm not sure they can accomplish that righteousness slightly intoxicate one step closer they have got there they applied for their licenses from the faa and they all that stuff is going in to work for the franciscans actually my second point in two thousand were gone spaceport america i think they're going to break ground i think they're actually going entering the night don't think it's actually going to be ready to do anything until totantora the tipping point here is that year that everything buildup and every infrastructures put in place but it's kind of that boringdon get to see a lot of things actually wisely important is biting that factory elsewhere ligneous you know take me forever to build that foundation you like i just want just put the walls up and the renomination in place the walls stood you done with the house right but you have to get that foundation correctly otherwise the whole house would go over
1264.59,1283.34, just magically stationhouse steps on its side i don't know why that happened that happenstance magically so that's also going to happen and then at the end of i think virgin galactic actually will be ahead of schedule
1284.0,1285.71, i know why i think this
1285.71,1309.92, i don't really have any good at the base this once to him in a dream came to me in a dream it just based on the data that they've already got white night one spaceship one and the fact that they've already got white night to build i think they're going to begin testing man to lay two thousand in and they're going to be ahead of schedule and i think and a cat says because richard branson are
1309.92,1328.1, a northeast rich and he has a passion in the dream and he can make a difference and that's exactly what he's doing and a well and there's nothing wrong with that no not at all he's fascinating he's fascinating i follow on twitter which you can do it then the show not
1328.1,1397.55, obviously it's just richerand any point is though that he consent is blogging about different things and but he's always thinking always always thinking about you know making things greener and politics and just how it necessitated to get to space to morrow and all the other agencies the wolstenholme nothing to be overtaken by the jacket that's not going to happen for quite a while because quite frankly as has the brain protheroe examinations really gobain to the constellation along but
1398.33,1416.63, was that an empty promise i don't know what i mean what's really going to happen there were in a global economic crisis right now do we really have the two million to give massoni's not sure i could even faultfinding
1417.08,1421.13, so others that and then
1421.28,1424.58, i missing one major event that i wanted to talk about
1425.09,1427.58, next north grumman
1427.7,1440.24, that was not the price foundation you know beginning the donation the google enterprise which is the one i'm really excited about it i don't think it's going to do anything
1440.51,1468.14, i meant to get i don't think they're going to launch and i think they're going to have a lot of vehicles and we're going to have a lot of play there we're going to get a lot of really cool things but i don't think we're actually going to find those men armitage interprise and how it is different from the north remodelling it's kind of an open ended things whoever does it first currently threatened
1468.23,1536.66, teams total so that's kind of what we're talking about as opposed to northern challenge where there's a everyone comes together at one certain time and although that might be changing to do the little thing and botheration skinner as space except because they need to keep their launch costs down youantee launching tinshemeth thereout we're going to see a lot of announcements of the glenwoods ideas that no one had maybe even really thought of before and some ideas that will possibly work that traditional scientists will be like that in
1536.72,1566.39, he really is that it's got to go athenodorus will become today's mooroolahs were not going to have humans on mars and two thousand nine an interesting little side note at once we get humans on the moon and we learn how to live on the moon it's not that much different moving tomasita much harder it's just just one step harder because of the distance but
1566.75,1580.43, you know so we got out we have to learn how to do this on the moon and we'll take another step closer that i unfortunately is going to be one of those swere we try to figure out is as going to the moon are they going back will the
1580.43,1591.05, administration continued down the path at the bush administration set forth which is we're going to the moon and if they do are they going to continue on the path of your going to the moon but you can't have any extra money
1591.2,1595.67, right you go to wage there so
1595.79,1637.67, an interesting it's going to be a foundation here we're going to see some kind of new things but there's not going to be a whole lot new going on other than space and virginie beginning of art of the irrigation part of the year and to the big middle part of the ear that isn't going to do a whole lot and skystein antisthenes because all the stuff that's building up in the will actually be let loose in two thousand and two thousand in the world as we know it will change and it's going to be because of companies like space the ex prize foundation virgin the lactic
1637.73,1654.23, you know armistace all these companies like this that are sitting they're going you know what this isn't good enough we can do this we find people in space is not good enough we can do more attentions the earl happens
1654.41,1659.81, there's money at myself box another words you totally agree with me in every way shape and form
1659.87,1664.4, but i did a much better way of stretching that out over about ten minutes
1665.93,1667.25, a
1667.31,1683.15, absolutely i think you guys on watch in stolid for this our last shell for which means we will not be broadcasting on twenty fifth we will not be broadcasting on the first of despite what she says we're not broadcasting on a first so the first show back is what that theory
1683.27,1689.27, something like that i militating it's the thorny so the first shell back will be the second
1689.27,1694.07, thursday in our time second friday in january actually write it
1694.25,1717.92, i can do that i do the numbers so actually technically not a second is the you know i got rebresentative first isn't in technically our show would be on the second not doing that and we have some interesting surprises in store for you we're going to hopefully be
1718.07,1763.82, giving a pacificist a little bit of a make over and we're going to make this show but a bit more fun it more in a face left she's giving a face left i'm getting a tommy talk going to be great and above job are getting the book operating walls pinkened lot of really cool new things happening into definitely check check to be eight january eighth at two o'clock a m coordinated universal time in the corvette we will of course will be waiting that kind of stuff out nowadays have a great two thousand days and all the best for two thousand nine sail
1764.21,1797.24, stationariness
