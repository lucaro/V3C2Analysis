188.22,345.96, what a difference women's ministry can make in a church i think about women men streets and i just want to tell you i voltairian for women to have friendships of other women there was a nurse study done a few years ago the study actually told that women are healthier their happier and live longer if they had close friendships with other women at the college church we have women of spirit i started twenty four years ago we had sixty ladies in attendance and to day there is over three hundred weapon its fun we call it a party with the purpose and it is party we have decorations we have food we have a devotional and we have a special feature the interesting thing is probably two thirds of the women who come from the community in its just a wonderful experience to see women as eighteen to a hundred and eight churchianity women all together enjoying a program and at our goal is is just to be sure that the ladies know jesus i had a pastor one time talked to me about women's ministerin he said when women monasticism babtists men it will be a bible ministry and you know that has haunted me for ever this is what i feel about i think that women ministries it's a place to plant seeds and that's what we do because our gold is that the ladies know about jesus and were leaving the harvesting up to the lord but we want them now that there is a plan for our solitaire and the still strength attached we have seen so many young women becoming involved just by being entered by older church women that what i love about women of spirit i love the idea that women come together and artevelde women and it's really just so fulfilling to see women both young and old maeonian not felicitations eliminated we don't have all the ideas and i am amazed at the wonderful idea that young women come up with to day
