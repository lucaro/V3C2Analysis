0.15,8.46, in this controlling and stimulating message we consider by god had to be combined and other related questions
8.61,12.33, quite in fine i god have to come as a feeble showman being
12.69,22.83, some cross what about before enough ter what about other groups of people but god need to incarnate multiple times
23.52,31.95, so this christmas day this morning ah as we take time to
32.43,36.69, think about the bath of the lodges christ
37.38,48.27, to talk about an think about a very important aspect about the birth of jesus and the basically ask one question
49.02,51.75, to one that one question
51.78,56.34, the most important thing for us about the birth of jesus
56.52,58.53, that
58.77,62.22, was god incarnate
63.27,66.66, was god who became man
68.34,71.1, many well god
71.49,72.9, with us
74.07,86.46, important thing if we miss that live misery thing else he can talk about the shepherds the king everybody else i came to attend the but place maheigan
86.64,88.41, this may be
88.5,93.69, this is that we are talking about is actually god in corners
94.83,96.84, missed everything
96.84,107.79, and there are many places in scripture where this truth is presented to us that jesus christ was born
107.97,114.6, i did thousand years ago whose battle are taking time to celebrate
114.63,117.69, god who became man
117.69,125.43, places and i distant two reference to a wee to passages out for you and me this morning there are many more in the bible
125.61,130.26, poison my patapedia but to the prophet mac
130.47,148.14, this he says but you better him so we know jesus was born in bethlehem to my castor telling is prophesying i speaking ahead of time and he says but you bethlehem though you are little among houses of culsalmon bedlam
148.23,156.78, insignificant though your little among the thousands of judah yet out of you shall come forth to me
157.08,162.51, the one to be ruler in israel king will come for
162.69,190.65, king will be born not of this little insignificant town of bethlehem one would come for the whole be a ruler in his well but what about this king the prophet continues to say whose going smoke or from of old from everlasting his origins or he is king is not somebody he who began in time he was already there from everlasting
192.03,200.25, an open of going to be born coming out of bedlam or kings always there from everlasting
202.26,209.91, somebody was started in time but what always eternally existed
211.68,218.22, awful passage is there new testifies to was a sixth eleven is one read that for us
219.0,225.9, from the contemporary english words were six christ was truly god
226.14,233.61, but it did not try to remain he quavered gone inside gave up everything and became a slave
234.36,237.18, i became like one of us
238.47,243.78, i was a he obeyed god even died on a cross
244.26,256.05, then god gave christ the highest place in order his name above all others so at the name of jesus every montbovon those and have been on earth and under the earth
256.29,263.82, to the glory of god the father every one openly agree jesus price is low
264.69,271.44, was christ he begins by saying christ was truly gone
274.68,275.67, and
276.87,283.35, became a man he became a man to appoint becoming a slave becoming like one of us
283.62,287.37, he obeyed he submitted
287.7,290.46, he died on a cross
291.9,297.0, so the question one single question i wanted to consider this christmas day
297.06,298.89, is this
299.91,304.77, why would god need to become a man
306.81,309.03, big point of the whole thing
310.71,319.32, no use a technical term why what is the reason for the incarnation incarnation god becoming a man
319.38,322.35, the point what's the purpose behind this way
323.28,325.17, why the coronation
327.45,331.17, and related this question began alterations
332.76,336.72, this morning as we can
339.63,342.72, and to come to the earth as a human person
344.61,345.87, why
346.89,349.23, a feeble human being
349.74,353.04, could god so as god
355.02,361.86, all like that staircase the force as a charge of the galician
367.53,370.86, and why could god show up as to
372.03,376.8, we do mistake nor you mention no debates nothing
378.12,382.38, god can perish no questions as
382.53,384.6, simple as
385.26,394.65, he came as a people you eponina as a baby in a major be cared for by his mother and is like pretty embarrassing
395.58,397.5, got to be cared for
400.74,403.11, a walk as a man
403.41,406.56, boy why
407.52,428.16, and then why a groome cross i mean as we met in the passage truly god becoming man becoming a slave becoming a beaten and in dying on a cross why a rococo now if you and i so well the reason god came in as well as save a sensation of doom
428.16,429.54, somewhere
431.01,434.31, not dis
434.43,437.16, you later
440.49,443.46, i i but cross
444.0,445.68, the big deal
446.43,448.26, the groom
449.22,450.9, but
456.27,465.06, he died in time one of our people before and one of my people after you and me living two thousand years ago men worcester
465.87,467.1, coming
467.46,469.08, as a
469.53,475.44, he impact me today how can impact you today what about before and after and 
476.16,480.93, and to what about other people groups are the groups of people
481.74,484.68, the obviously came to 
484.83,487.65, small repeople in the middle east
488.61,493.35, the other groups of people and all the other continents
493.44,497.76, in the incarnation of god to be necessary
499.92,503.34, very partial that one small group
503.55,506.55, as an incarnation of god
507.0,511.14, the other groups of people and the words and what a bad
513.33,517.71, came back the demagoguing over nor nothin time
519.18,527.19, god need to come out betimes met incarnate multiple times because in our modern day of commences in the ordinary
527.49,528.99, and
531.3,538.47, relate to us but elective there remained for them so
539.01,540.99, one question
541.23,584.25, why would there be a need for god to incarnate began have all of these other questions attorney they try to cover that but if only to get into transeat a test this that there is a lot of scripturin all of this and but bellona the time to mention all the verses and read all this scripture so i would be making a lot of statements but i want to understand a lot of this is back up by scripture and if he had to do you know many a time we had many others we could give you all the references itobad of much of what we are saying this morning but for the sake of brevity of old make these statements and keep moving solitary beginning
584.55,586.35, maybe before
586.98,590.46, beginning the for the beginning
590.46,592.05, there was one
592.86,599.58, god god the father god the son god the holy predicament there was a laugh
601.29,603.18, in the mind of god
603.39,609.18, god lives or outside of time we don't measure things by a d and b c
609.99,611.73, in the hindoo
612.15,615.09, the bible reveals to us that
615.15,619.23, i was already finished before even started
621.84,639.03, everything was completed before he actually started doing things because in the mind of god it was all done god lives out of time he can be at the beginning we call the beginning and he can be at the end what we call the end it's not the pinning of the end for him its beginning in to you me
639.36,643.53, so he can be at the beginning and a hand at the same time
643.95,645.84, i understand that dubarry
647.28,651.72, god lives outside of time so in his mind
651.72,655.23, he could see everything the beginning of the end is all done
655.59,657.63, so nothing
657.9,664.44, that was going to take place in time was a surprise to go nothing was a surprise
665.37,667.17, he only
667.17,669.78, so the bible says things like
669.81,701.7, even before the foundation of all the prose was determined even the for the foundation of all the lambs probitas written the names of people even the elaboration of a he put predetermine what kind of people he wants to have people who had been his sons and daughters even before the foundation of the world decided to have a people who would stand before it clothesless nothing interlining to him that all he that everything had already mesmerist's what i'm going to do
702.78,715.68, now even the whole journey to get there it may seem a long time will you be god six thousand years god this is taking a long to money rapidly but the bible says a thousand years is like
716.28,721.05, one day for god so wishes a long time to you and me
721.38,722.79, i
723.99,726.3, god
727.14,729.6, he's not getting on
729.72,738.18, a long berthoud of time and so for him this is nothing
739.17,742.32, he knows what he's going to have he's going to have a people
742.53,748.77, righteous holy blameless just sons and daughters in his love he knows that
749.31,752.07, everything was completed before he started
752.49,757.77, now we come to the beginning in the beginning god created anything
759.45,775.95, he created man woman arbalestrier in the book of genesis and they were in perfect fellowship at the communion him they could relate to him nothing between them and god and god and walk in the garden the color the name at ingathering up in your
779.28,803.88, perfect communion fellowship and a garden be the dervishes perfect communion in and man and woman was created to be retaliated to represent god in the air behind them with the party to to to to take on the erasure to multiply the philibert and anathemas in on the earth
805.89,806.91, then
807.81,812.58, understand that god created man as free moral being
812.88,817.5, you and i have a free will it is given to man right there the garden beaten
818.4,822.39, free moral beings we could choose to do what we wanted to do
822.96,825.87, god in his solitary
827.76,829.38, actually
829.53,839.64, release you and me to do whatever we wanted to do and he was losing none of the really when he said i'm giving you free botany make the choice you want
840.06,843.36, not going to make me any less god
843.42,846.21, secure god was in his
847.44,850.05, you say you do whatever you want
850.47,852.03, in our free
852.24,854.97, it undermined my saladin anyway
857.91,863.22, god surely not his insecurity god soldiery the
863.49,868.53, sandeman with three boats at you coodent
868.56,869.88, on the earth
871.65,874.56, not all i you
875.01,882.03, and that's why in the garden but they did so bad god godlike the presently go poor
882.33,884.43, to
884.76,892.77, you know we cannot kids we can put him at entotto that we make the footsteps on weary
893.16,896.1, he could say the other trouble
896.49,903.66, i'd given you an me sobered a free but in this sort given you and me free to whatever you please
904.02,913.44, he's expecting that free wi the combat him and say i worship you are recognized who you are i'm all free blackness
914.16,918.69, on rebellion go into that veather i want you to go to
919.05,920.7, back
922.47,930.36, so we understand from scripture that man women are alive the sand the obey god
930.63,934.5, and then came in all the consequences of sin
936.3,937.5, in
937.53,940.38, separate us from god
942.06,944.67, and coming in through one man
946.08,950.55, post upon the entire human race all those who by
950.58,952.32, after that
952.86,954.42, boris
955.98,960.69, and sin becomes to speak barrier between god and man
961.53,968.19, we try to reach me but there's a barriers because goddess wholly his super
968.67,971.67, the sun actually separates us from god
971.94,973.47, becomes a very
973.59,977.43, so endurable blessings of god on olives
979.26,982.2, god wants to bless us but there is this barrier case
984.96,989.64, and all to manly the babble as at the result of sanstead
989.79,993.87, we are going to be eternally separated from god
993.96,999.75, how until and unless the periosteum between us and god
1000.17,1002.12, separated from god
1003.14,1004.25, no
1004.91,1006.35, an
1006.5,1008.87, making attempts to reach god
1009.35,1011.93, always made attempts to reach out
1015.59,1021.98, there is eternity the bible says in every person's heart to something and every person that longs for eternity
1022.64,1023.96, eternal
1025.13,1042.56, we can see our own conscience of a time and to ourselves there is no god that doesn't make that go away there is no eternity that doesn't make it turn go away but we can see our own conscience and see baroncelli too and got up in a stupor
1043.31,1044.24, but
1044.66,1055.07, every person there is eternity babe's got a put a terrier and something within every person that says i got to be more to life but just my living and dying
1057.05,1065.33, to be meaning has got to be purposely at all creation its gods but in steady unabating low and here
1066.65,1068.87, i could be an accident
1069.26,1082.31, resign the intelligence we see all around us from the pelignian leaf to the intelligence that you see the gallies all that is priyambada exists
1082.79,1088.4, something italian each on a antoinette door closed because of sin
1088.97,1090.65, come
1091.94,1093.62, a predicament
1096.05,1098.27, so we attempt to reach god
1098.27,1099.83, impossible
1100.94,1102.41, holy
1102.56,1109.85, one speck of secondariness presence goddess love love immense immensely
1112.1,1115.37, he's also just seas to be dealt with
1118.82,1120.56, this is a
1120.74,1122.6, ordination comes in
1125.69,1134.57, her attention to four reasons why the incarnation is necessary for the purpose by a incarnation of one he came
1136.04,1140.63, have to become man to real god to us
1145.07,1176.39, man was trying to decide on the sun what god looks like maybe he looks like the sun or maybe looks like the moon many he looks like this man looks like that so we all in our own imagination for trinitatis god really looked like maybe a really angry god noisily good god made a mad gotobed god or kinds of things but god god says i i'm going to reveal myself to you but i have to do it in terms of you can understand
1177.65,1187.28, not just picture this if you and this is just just imagination if you wanted to communicate with an an
1192.05,1194.21, what is the best way to do it
1197.03,1198.08, come
1200.63,1204.89, i did all about your sins and technology and strong understand them
1207.17,1212.15, we can but all during telligence and stones
1213.29,1214.67, only way
1214.82,1217.7, you could countenance
1217.85,1219.68, coming 
1221.63,1236.12, this is a poor example but magnify his example in foretime that's what god decided to do i got a communicate with these people the only way i can speak to them is become like one of
1239.57,1243.89, this is done by the inlet god
1243.89,1247.28, pickering in mind
1247.64,1254.66, as to you and me but he asked to do it in terms you and i can relate to
1254.72,1255.74, so
1255.98,1257.3, okay
1257.42,1259.37, on a body
1260.06,1262.67, they can see and touch
1263.0,1266.36, i was a big termination them
1270.38,1280.49, that this jesus was born he is the image of the invisible god
1280.85,1285.65, people said he is the exact image
1285.65,1289.91, the unseen leaning out
1289.94,1291.41, his glory
1293.39,1307.25, yet for this god to become a man in the oudinot contain cannot contain the infiniteness of god holy compress infinity in something
1307.46,1331.67, and so he had to leave us said his only potencies of this incendiary persons but the bad part of the teeth tahitou for a human body and he had confined himself to what a marabouta contain and so was i was born as a babe in bethlehem and walked as a man in galilee
1335.3,1351.56, if you want to see at the bales look at jesus christ he is the image of the invisible god he is the expropriation of god that's what god looks like that's the nature of god and bodily in me in a human was
1354.17,1356.15, why god have to become a man
1356.45,1361.16, we amorous because you and i were not willing to take
1361.25,1372.83, a pound the bible sir but his invisible attributes were evil to us in creation but in recognizing the greatness of god in creation which aworriting
1377.69,1385.04, that is a metapsychosis guys are not getting it
1385.43,1392.03, spectator creation about to become like a great being myself
1392.12,1393.56, we
1393.68,1394.82, the
1397.52,1403.28, the second reason that god had to become a man in carnation and take place
1406.28,1409.34, come man to demonstrate
1410.42,1413.24, well original design to live like
1415.43,1419.99, the same analogy if you want to teach an onoto be in at
1420.89,1423.02, important to become an end
1426.14,1430.04, demonstrate to the ante this one and to
1430.46,1432.53, then one until
1434.12,1437.63, and all atonement rate to you and me
1437.78,1447.26, but kind of man the kind of people to mortal for you and me that kind of person we are supposed to be he became a man
1447.32,1453.95, i walk the walk the same author you are in but i'll show you what i originated for man to walk in
1456.59,1460.61, do it in the comic of that of the world at that time
1462.59,1464.36, he didn't have the phone
1465.44,1472.64, all the dignities the point the point is what would man look like if he walked on the 
1473.99,1476.21, areotha
1477.2,1479.15, a man supposed to be like
1479.18,1480.47, that's it
1480.77,1489.53, became a man to demonstrate to us to show us the model for us got to this is the life origin for you to live on the earth
1490.28,1502.97, even if i came in on liveliness of her sin you can livingston you can live at tories of the recreance in all that the world may druidical tories catharine you
1507.05,1508.85, look at jesus
1509.24,1514.52, the life you and i supposed to live and yet growing into that treason
1514.79,1516.32, he had to become a man
1517.85,1520.55, so that he could represent man
1522.83,1526.34, the first person adam de spain visibly in this
1527.75,1531.62, become a man in order to represent you and me
1532.76,1534.71, first man adam
1535.4,1541.76, truman race the entire race in subjection to the devil
1542.93,1545.42, satan gave mastery of the earth
1546.71,1548.06, one man
1548.3,1553.19, the behalf of the entire human race to
1555.38,1557.78, we presume
1558.65,1561.98, half back to sensory
1562.34,1564.68, take that piece of paper back
1565.88,1568.61, selling what items in
1568.7,1571.28, i am the second adam
1571.88,1573.71, doing it differently
1574.37,1576.2, taking back
1576.41,1577.67, everything
1577.79,1588.17, he gave to you so jesus said things like this now is the ruler of the world judge now is the prince of this world cast out
1588.53,1591.98, came to do that representing human me
1594.65,1596.12, before satan
1598.04,1600.86, but you also represent you and me to forgo
1602.51,1607.76, the priests all other man made attempts to get to god
1607.76,1611.24, failed because every other person was born in the
1613.82,1619.22, they had you done for their own sins for he was a priest a bible says
1620.42,1622.1, could represent
1622.13,1628.28, fully before god and yet bear intercessor because he also knew what he felt like
1628.31,1633.35, neighbor to the stuff to us is there deprecates forten it says
1633.71,1661.16, much as the children are particular flesh of belisarius fleshy hesselius he became just like us so that to that you know a throne the death that's the first point to present you and me against the devil giving us victory and there were seventy eighteen that all things he peeped to be made like his brother became a human man that he might be a merciful and faithful i precureing us before god
1661.49,1662.87, things to one
1663.02,1668.36, to arouse and in our helps us in our weakness he understands us completely
1669.35,1674.12, why it had to be a man betray to represent you and me so far
1674.63,1677.84, the last number for what we have to become
1677.84,1682.25, to be he became a man to be a perfect substitute
1682.79,1685.07, this is sort of important
1685.82,1690.86, i substitute say be on have said
1691.13,1703.31, we each one of us deserve punishment the consequences of our sins are upon our lives and the consequence of our sins are going to take us to place of retardation separated from god and hell
1705.38,1706.88, none of us
1706.97,1710.87, even old sins forget for the sense of the others
1716.69,1719.06, we need somebody sidles
1721.01,1726.95, then say i will die in the place of every one else because i don't have any sense of my own
1726.98,1727.97, for
1730.07,1731.45, such a man
1731.6,1732.86, come
1732.92,1735.92, god became a man
1736.73,1741.05, but every other man or woman born after animals born in sin
1742.94,1746.48, matter how good or how bad they have life life on earth
1747.92,1752.78, busiebody else but he was god became a man
1753.2,1756.8, stilicho human
1757.19,1758.3, and the 
1758.99,1764.12, i can be the perfect substitute i will take upon myself
1764.3,1768.08, sense of the whole i begin their place
1768.47,1769.85, upon me
1769.97,1772.61, since of the whole 
1773.78,1776.75, he could do that because he was without sin
1776.96,1779.39, he was god walked as a man
1779.81,1786.41, the perfect substitute nor the man nor the woman could ever do that
1788.06,1801.56, the why roman spied the bible says was eighty nineteen o one man often that is adam he said but what did that resulted judgment came in all men resulting in condemnation
1801.68,1805.94, but the one man writes a
1806.66,1810.23, the free gift came to all men resulting
1810.38,1812.48, justification of life
1814.13,1820.85, but as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners by one man's obedience many will be made
1821.21,1822.62, one man
1823.46,1825.11, to be the right person
1825.2,1826.85, in his own
1827.75,1829.88, only be gone
1831.71,1844.91, became a man so it has go back were quickly to the side questions we are the beginning and the close so why did he have to come as a feeble human being because all these four things he could only do as a human
1849.23,1855.35, was gone in auditores god to man to speak our line but he had confined himself
1855.56,1858.41, human body had revealed to us
1861.38,1862.88, he had to
1863.51,1869.81, strato our slipping in a human body what mamurius to live as
1871.88,1877.13, in person he represents us beargarden against the devil and as a human person
1877.46,1879.35, he could be arite
1880.67,1888.53, why grimross i mean why if god was a god of law what could a shaving on the view
1891.35,1894.92, why the cross was necessary first of all
1895.7,1899.18, had to be consistent with the nature
1899.36,1907.28, stablemen libelous you but it's all so wholly to sinister in his sight and you want in
1907.7,1914.48, is also just which mentation overlook sin that would be being unjust
1915.68,1922.73, he said i love all the citizens of the country to all you sit in your forgiven to an ever you want
1923.24,1924.77, that justice
1925.73,1927.44, common as sole
1930.71,1932.06, just
1932.21,1934.04, a quiet
1934.34,1936.62, to be penalized
1940.58,1943.52, soul that sends it will die
1945.05,1953.75, to mention blood but can make it a comin for the soul because sin has to be paid for with a light
1954.83,1957.62, his blood that makes a torment for a
1958.94,1963.77, reason why the cross was necessary is because forgiveness is never cheap
1967.13,1987.23, touman tom speaking humanly speaking if somebody of pendules take an example if your cause friend betrayed you did something wrong i mean let's say no destitution your close business partner he turned against you he took up in a money and all that and his portrait you
1988.91,1993.35, you ask people to have a chin i could retaliate
1995.21,2005.47, something wrong be what is just but i'm talking about the emotional satanical retain i could not tell everybody what he did i could fight back i can all the
2006.37,2009.79, i'm going to choose to forgive
2013.39,2015.73, because i am a
2016.51,2021.25, but i take a wrong
2021.79,2023.89, i forgive you
2024.55,2027.73, i never cheap somebody's paying the price
2030.88,2035.44, but on much higher scale
2036.85,2040.24, i love you so much i willing to forgive you
2040.63,2044.17, i will pay the price
2044.77,2046.21, one
2046.33,2048.46, this is the price i need to pay
2049.78,2052.99, i need to give up my life
2053.14,2058.6, a human person asked the perfect substitute i do give up my life and willing to do it
2058.6,2060.31, because i love you so much
2063.64,2065.59, never 
2065.8,2074.95, to the reason why the cross was so necessary as to lovers always substitutionary if you say you love somebody who will step into their world you will
2075.34,2076.36, there
2077.05,2080.29, careful the answer become in one
2080.35,2083.11, in other words do something there
2086.35,2091.21, that's how god demonstrated his love for us coming into this world
2092.38,2094.81, but before enough to
2100.66,2102.79, it
2105.1,2108.46, just use a simple example a boy
2108.7,2112.81, you who are using a credit card but two months and you
2113.14,2114.4, spent
2116.59,2118.09, the
2121.24,2124.69, asarhadon for months more
2126.67,2130.48, some long the way your dad pays ten
2132.4,2135.07, most
2135.28,2137.65, now the three are
2139.45,2141.97, everything before
2146.86,2148.36, i got
2151.42,2164.44, so when jesus christ to adheres the price she paid what pray took care of everything before everything ever to come paid in full
2167.5,2168.58, i
2168.58,2171.58, price paid everything in full
2180.34,2182.56, other groups of people
2186.13,2194.74, one personal incarnation of god just because one group in the middle east received theirs the piles were clear
2195.34,2198.25, jesus did come just for the jews
2201.1,2205.18, my princess to this both of the old and the new testaments
2206.02,2210.43, to make mention of one year and first john temperament the bible says
2211.03,2217.72, he became the offering for our sins and not roses only but for the sins of the whole
2217.96,2227.62, so every group of people did not need its own incarnation god comes once he comes among the people but he came for the whole world
2233.53,2236.14, god nicodemite times
2239.32,2241.36, very clear on this
2241.57,2246.1, jesus christ is god's one and only incarnation
2248.2,2249.7, the offering
2249.79,2257.59, the work he can't do was complete he said it is finished he didn't say it fifty per cent for i thank you father
2260.32,2262.09, i completed
2262.63,2264.46, hebrew stoats is here
2267.88,2272.98, the state jesus had made one offering for since
2273.01,2284.05, he took a place at the right hand of god and again and restore because by one offering he has made a command complete refer those who are made holy one
2284.41,2289.75, sacrifice once and for all the care the everything
2290.62,2293.44, logically
2294.13,2302.95, there was a necessity for several incarnations of allusively that every previous incarnation failed in some way
2305.26,2308.65, reincarnation was insufficient in some manner
2309.91,2312.67, he was a necessity for another one
2312.82,2317.17, the bible says god came once to care everything
2317.23,2322.75, completed there was no need for any further incarnation of god
2322.87,2325.06, so we do not need
2326.56,2332.38, multiple incarnations of god or time so it collusion that this morning
2335.05,2341.92, jesus christ the reason for the incarnation towel the demonstrate to represent
2342.46,2345.31, to be the perfect substitute
2347.17,2349.24, came to be our saviour
2349.48,2356.05, died for us and rose again he ascended into heaven and is alive to day
2358.81,2364.45, one thing in my jeanette all appeal people in the world to do
2365.35,2373.96, serpents believe and follow the patmans a turn away from one way a turner my own
2373.96,2379.36, of doing things of from me prefigure out a way to get to god repents
2380.05,2385.81, i believe in hostesses what he came to do what he has done for me believing him
2387.07,2388.42, follow him
2390.58,2393.04, he says that
2393.28,2406.0, through his name every one who has stayed in him behave forgiveness of sins that barrier sin it is broken and everything that sent put upon us as remote the way when we believe in the lord jesus christ
2409.45,2415.75, i callate he do then a few moments to pray
2422.32,2424.09, this passion
2424.3,2429.01, we looked at the reason for the incarnation why did god have to come
2430.6,2433.24, for you came from me
2435.61,2438.55, to do something he could not do for ourselves
2440.11,2444.22, do something that no other human being can do for givin me
2446.89,2450.94, to bring us some of the relationship with god
2451.27,2453.04, ablative
2453.07,2457.21, the way god wants us to live in our context to day

2468.49,2470.68, being a man becoming a man
2470.8,2473.86, and dying on the cross for you and me
