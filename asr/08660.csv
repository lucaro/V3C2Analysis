2.1,39.3, all right oh my name is bill stagg i run and operate a small commercial be outfit sweet acre aperies this in the shoeshop rationally right now a few minutes of salona and ye've been running that for i guess four years now and spiteful growth process yet and then a work for the ministry of agriculture and lands as a local inspector for the area i been doing that that's my fourth year as well this year be keeping in itself is a is a very meditative practice it has wonderful coming effects into so much research done
39.54,46.98, the benefits of you know often here but these farms of the tape troubled teens or whatever and introduce them to
47.01,52.59, horses and things of that sort and i think my keeping is a wonderful thing
52.74,70.8, that can be done in an urban setting we have hives in our front yard i'm not sure for supposed to what we do and are neighbors love it because they're plum trees are heavy and the flowers are pollinated and i think one advantage to urban beekeeping is
71.1,81.63, more and more cities are passing laws restricting or prohibiting use of different chemicals for controlling weeds and what not and you have so many
81.84,84.72, flowers and a city
85.29,87.78, i think it better well
87.87,94.35, all the bees in north america that they are being used or from europe so there's no
94.59,108.66, truly north american honey bee that exists there is a lot of of different stock that went into the stock that i have i used basically an open
108.93,139.77, population mating system that harry laid low basically came up without a california many many moons ago there's nothing really new about it basically i select breeders the best performers from my different birds and i have yard set up from green rod to chase which is a quite good distance and i bring them all into a meeting or and i sat at my starters and finishers and raise cells and when i raised celsitudine
139.92,141.45, cells
141.51,145.8, going to be transferred over to chase and made it
145.92,150.03, made in these colonies like these units you see here
150.06,154.86, some of them they have no queen so were in tappan so i want to take queen cells
156.09,157.11, from
157.44,180.78, orators that weren't in this yard last year and then introduce them here so that insulation in the stop there the wonderful moths the hinds fifty seven breed i guess most of my queens are they look like italians but i bet you thirty forty percent look a lot like carniola their dark dark stock would be dark queens
180.87,210.66, in late early s b c did a big push under john corner with time was a provincial airs and they wanted to become self sufficient in stock production and producer own stock and not rely on the state or off shore for queens so one of the guys involved in stating that his name was john gates and he lives in armstrong not too far from here and i worked for him for a few years and basically they took commercial stock
212.4,215.82, from the big producers around the world and
215.82,235.8, wintered them in the vernon area and monitored them and chose basically the best performer shows that built up well one's a pretty honey nice temperament and continued that process ever since throughout the years with so many different projects that have been done it
235.89,246.72, and time again it shows that local stock does out perform imported stock it's tough when you're getting packages especially from down under
246.75,259.26, s are getting ready for winter down there and we move them across the globe when they're going into fall coming christmas time well in a sense down there
261.03,267.57, it's a pretty good shock for them to be transported around the world and then expect them to perform in an environment that they weren't raised in
267.66,293.19, you started me keeping you have to know about vera you will have it and i know the first few years i was keeping bees i didn't feel like i was going to be meeting as i felt like i was going to light meetings because that's all they talked about though i'm here talk about bees not what be crazy might but it's something that you can still keep these very successfully with vera
293.22,295.83, but you have to
295.98,299.1, understand a lot more about biology
299.61,307.38, the bees and also the lights themselves as compared to twenty years ago you often hear people say
307.62,309.57, before
309.66,317.16, the night came over there was a lot more of be havers and not be keepers whereas now
317.43,325.95, with a rare and the best that we have its fleshless pretty much out and because if they don't know how it
326.22,328.77, tell the difference between a
328.83,337.17, high that succumbing to to pass and a healthy colony they're going to lose their bees
337.47,351.81, several years now i've been using exclusively form cast its organic acid is found in honey which why i got quickly sold on it
352.35,354.87, again it
354.96,362.46, you have to monitor the colonies and see how they're responding the one thing about forecasts quite whether dependent
362.67,366.66, so if the weather isn't right
366.99,370.02, the time your treatment according to
370.17,376.62, what the weather is another thing about form a alike cause there's no residual
376.89,380.31, effects in the coal
380.76,385.29, and it does not impact drone development or
385.29,392.91, these other things like the harsh chemicals do and those testifies build up in the wax over time and can be quite detrimental
392.91,414.09, to the colonies in fact that's another big part of sci thinks these chemicals that the keepers you know we love to point our fingers everybody else but the keepers have been dumping the same stuff in their hives for twenty years now and the environment
414.3,417.78, get to the point of being talked to the bees themselves so
418.23,429.21, the apathy some of the reasons why i'm so uniform as it as far as i know all the organic associations that do certify the keepers approved the use of form a case
429.63,438.69, is a wonderful wonderful thing and you know it is coming it is meditative you are going to get stung that 
438.87,440.61, part of the
441.3,443.34, part of the equation
444.21,461.16, i think it's a wonderful wonderful thing to get involved in and i've tried to enter a couple of people each year and make sure they got started off on the right foot but i encourage especially the beginning be papers to know what's going on
461.22,471.96, and to know not just about the bees but understand a little bit of matsadi's a form of husbandry and it's just like anything else if you get
472.38,480.54, do you're going to have to realize that you're going to have to you know make sure that he stays healthy or if you got goats or anything else so
481.17,482.76, that 
483.81,485.28, for me
