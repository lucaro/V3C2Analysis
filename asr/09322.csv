493.62,512.94, were they from the later on to have a totalitarian twenty six red tails here all right and it is when it just shows you as you know they're very common throughout this whole northeastern region or in fact their common all all across north america and south america
513.12,515.67, and unfortunately
515.7,526.59, a lot of their problems arise you know there had bycars people shoot them goes on and on so probably one of the biggest problems they have to day is in a human
526.92,528.27, he
