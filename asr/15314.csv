37.83,126.24, you think that when i taught me i didn't want to go back to bananas that the board of tenawas the chief water pollution enforcement officer in emerson county for several years and then he got praeteriti in the good old days only really worth internationally respected for being able to run a good and efficient utility and take good care of liniment i am a state certified teacher i have been teaching generally what's called not formerly meeting on the guest teacher friday or an hour or a week or whatever but i've also done some formal teaching and most recently i taught us semester long honors scholars seven and nevertheless year and again out of foster mother foster children come with a ladder challenges and the child that i handle longest in it was the record that anybody ever had this kid was very badly abused when he was very young they came to me because they thought i could be an applicant for this kid that so many people wouldn't take because he had a reputation and sufficient about parenthesised
126.24,143.58, he comes they are education and transportation and social services and while most of my engineering career had to do with his energy efficiency which is like wolmaranstad sewer
143.67,149.04, can't deal with war and sore without also dealing with gas and electric and roads and bridges
149.16,154.32, fact that i'm an engineer means that i can look at complicated budgets
154.44,158.34, a formula and not have no islander
158.34,164.91, i can look at this the whole thing went what was the big thing that causes to despise a section
164.91,237.12, the fact that they were arguing about how much extra infrastructure we goin to put and david williams district this engineer is gone to say no weight this is over here this is a real safety project that is not iolantha i can probably make a more persuasive argument doesn't mean in body with listen but i think i can attack it as an engineer and persuasive way and again because i'm a teacher i understand that education department and because it acosta part understand social services now the other big area of course as prisons have no i haven't been a prisoner thou i have been a prisoner of a state that kentmere out to its potential a state that i love and that i know you love to and so while i want that topic i want to bring out the real tattheration appears to be that i'm a onerstand in the nominalistic to you all that you are and idealists well and then you think that it's not unreasonable
237.12,284.52, that social workers are aground to run interference for all the kids that need social workers and that you don't think it so inappropriate or unrealistic or overly idealistic to have enough social workers to run inferiors nor that you don't think it's inappropriate to expect to have teachers have a fighting chance and not have thirty eight kids and the class time for what the people want to talk about teacher accountability but that dog don't hunt and my book to use a kentucky rule phrase as long as your overloading all these teachers with unrealities so if that's idealism okarian way i want an outshoot we're facing right now to day the election is in thirty days or weeks from to

302.34,328.23, conventional was the most still that i can win this race if and only if we have a good ground campaign and i i was told in any people want to be asked for the vote i couldn't understand it because people like us which he was canton their issues right nobody asked me about my issues i can carthis hand a number of people who ask me for my standardised clearly didn't like it in his not going to vote for me
328.26,371.79, just give me the opportunity to say i can tell you didn't i better answer but i would rather tell you the truth and lose your boat that the patronize you was something i don't really believe that's pretty cool but anyway the point is this there are forty nine thousand registered democrats in the istory it's a primary election there are no republicans running and we are going to have to get people to understand they have to go out on the twenty seven of may and that we need them to vote for us if we can do that we can win this race so i've talked wattahomigie to go with open very good audience thank you very much eaten
