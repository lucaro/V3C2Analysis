1.11,17.73, john rather as jemimar my name is emily miss rope and imitation major production major as rampart or technically madinier i saw a mouse though my
17.79,22.53, in the film program but my fourth year called a go along with go
23.73,34.77, i came to southern because i was obsessed with film and southern had a film program i knew and something different i was not join ersat all school is enter me
35.01,35.79, and
36.42,81.42, and did actually mentioned to me that i well know you really have a hobby with film would you think about pursuing that way i was really nervous about like coming into the game so late like this not a freshman i feel like on my goodness far behind every one's got to know everything like i feel like every one lives in film is like comedown with a camera like i'm going to film everything i see i even know that much about cameronians
81.54,84.42, all of whom were freshmen like me
84.81,120.75, and i hadn't network at all and by the time second semester rolled around i didn't really have a project i started out as an education major and i didn't really like it might too was like in class one day you should want do this every day awake up so excited to do this and i was like i don't think i will be just quick in my head that this was not right for me so then i went on to try publications and that wasn't really quick in either so i was like i just to take a year off and go somewhere and just kind of figure out what i want to do
121.17,133.41, i was terrified because i was pretty sure there were no directors left and that not working at all i just really really panicked and i dropped the glass and replaced with literature class
133.44,136.11, without telling any professors
136.47,144.42, the things that really tells me i think was that you know i wasn't a freshman in college and so i felt like i had a more
144.48,171.36, purposeful outlook on life at that point and i think that really helped me here soon or stomach this is my very first time being astrophel i'm scared to death right now and actually maltreat in my head to the camera operators habitation the shot and lenses with cameramen we needed biting so
171.42,177.24, i hope i get it off the annetta's cool your i went in
177.3,182.94, and i remember meeting with my adviser and she asked me now are you sure you don't want to do any film at all
183.24,186.78, and having a very very long pause and
186.9,203.61, a million thoughts flashing through my mind and then if i could watch my that part of my life on a screen i'd be booing it myself and i said yes no film can mean interesting my first film and film school as a freshman was was challenging
203.64,208.83, and when i first was approach of the idea of doing it i was like yeah i can do this
208.92,213.06, then i started to people like oh you can't do that the freshman
214.29,220.8, he noted that they were a couple of times when i almost backed out because i was like
220.86,235.59, balancing the fact that i'm producing my own present project that not a small one and in directing another project there is a lagging on i used to want to be an actress when i was little but i never had thought of
235.62,236.4, the scene
236.43,260.37, like one of the camera at me in acreculture ones lay running around to inconsiderate like oh i'm not going to care like cameras are my face whatever but it's a will be a little i care there is a lot more people than was expecting insulting in there and i like the screen writing that
260.61,262.8, in a writer
263.76,274.92, being about the future i did a little bit scared i came in pretty much a queen slave i mean i'm interested in filmy didn't like start off that way so i felt everyone was going to be like she is now what she
274.98,280.56, why is she here but really every one has been so helpful
280.59,282.33, i spent the summer after
282.33,283.68, freshman year
284.01,304.44, uncomfortable with myself i even had them about going back into the film program and all working out that really frustrated me because it felt like my brain was teasing me like you could do this if you know you wanted to make any sense as a person and i considered that summer going back i drafted an email for some reason i didn't send it
304.5,305.82, i just felt
307.65,314.04, i was really denying was just how scared i was basically every explanation i gave myself to rationalize
314.31,316.29, my major to something
316.29,319.23, random and completely unconnected to my heart
321.36,326.55, we are on a film shoot i'm doing sound i believe
326.64,340.2, the first time i've done so and glad i'm getting some experience in that i am feeling less freshman like which is canonically were a close net part when i have seen them all before but this is a high level of attraction usual i guess
340.47,345.96, definitely want to get on more films because it's fun and a good thing for fame
346.41,350.46, i was extremely frustrating for me and
350.73,355.17, at the point where like if this is what film is i don't want to do it
355.32,358.65, then after no directing and writing it was like
358.89,362.31, what's to be is anything you want to make it to be
362.67,364.92, that really helped a lot
365.4,366.78, is
366.81,369.24, in oswego
369.3,370.89, people know
371.64,378.9, then a little bit and see like inside of you i just want to make films that have some kind of like significant
378.96,382.11, message those are the ones that i like the mast
382.11,386.97, a lot of people who in this world don't do what they want to do
387.06,391.77, they think they have to and their miserable despite what they tell themselves
392.67,394.74, and i didn't want to be that way
395.25,396.87, i wanted to be a story teller
397.38,400.29, i want to make films
400.65,403.74, impact some one's life in some way
403.86,405.36, i don't want to take
405.48,410.58, formations bility lightly i want to show people things that are real
410.7,422.16, wait that was completely out of my brain i really liked it and other people did that what's more important to me i really motivates me to stay on top of my game next semester
423.9,425.67, i did the first time round
426.21,431.79, it's obvious that god has had a hand in everything that i have done like in the fact that i
431.85,434.37, nursing and switched to southern
434.64,444.03, there seem to fill making the a huge difference all the skill has given me in life and talents have all been
444.42,445.68, for
445.68,447.54, then for film making
447.6,452.73, tolerably narrows and i don't feel like i can do it but then you this process
453.12,476.28, figure out how i can do this and it's fine it's hard work but it's so rewarding and i mean as long as you work for it i feel like people can do amazing things if you really strive for that goal how quickly you make friends and how quickly something goes from scary and new to i love this place is really growing on me
