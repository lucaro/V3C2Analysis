62.13,82.14, we're making a bell using the portland a roach storehouse of the posts that are in it so that alliterative are allodial or these fossils will then be in the surface of the netherstanes
82.23,87.93, also promotion years ago what is negative or becomes positive
88.2,90.24, the violence out of this
91.83,94.44, i look quite geological
94.56,99.0, going to it's going to be crossed with fossils going to be looked like it's been
99.0,101.61, dredged up from the foot the seal on the
101.76,103.26, a different age
103.32,105.0, and

108.6,113.01, that's what the scientist to saying is happening now that we are in a period
113.01,119.01, of extinction of geological scale
119.22,122.13, baisingen communication the by
122.25,126.66, has been removed to the centuries and by different cultures
127.11,128.79, press different things
128.91,130.23, the men of culture
130.38,135.0, it was we had to come up with a new bell sound
135.06,138.99, to respond to the complexity of the issues
139.08,140.7, better raised
140.76,145.98, as we came more aware about extinction and the influences
145.98,148.02, that it's going to have on our lives

152.85,153.93, these
155.25,161.94, forms were then an experiment of just playing so shapes
161.97,175.08, to get some ideas that we could then take to the computer and work out a with the programs that analyzed frequency vibration in order to model a new sounds for the memo bell
175.2,178.59, he
178.59,195.99, they were many forecited with casting in the stone
196.02,204.36, one changes in store to melted a thousand degrees and that about the temperature that the metal goes in
204.45,206.34, so concerned about
206.37,218.1, the gases that were released them that process and so the many holes drilled in the rock or a honeycutt would fence to allow the gases of the cumulated in the snow
218.31,226.86, so we could have a volcano of it's being sitting in the ground for a week now said that the metal very very very slowly 
227.19,233.28, one and this is a traditional technique for bells i believe make a better way

290.73,294.15, that in some way
294.69,295.98, with
296.79,300.63, scene of the seepage of extinction
302.19,306.78, coin the phrase extinction when looking at this stone when measuring up
307.8,323.13, fire blood and for the rebuilding it was all seeing these fossils that he first realized that something had existed before us incorporating that in an object acknowledging both our awareness of
323.16,330.3, where we have come from and what is happening now and what possible options for as may be in the future
332.82,336.15, the emotional be the
336.99,340.35, speaking part of that thought
341.79,348.06, now we get to hear the robert hope well along twenty times for retint
