0.39,28.92, for all of us it's about predicting were the consumers going and getting caparison of the things you want to do is created that don't suck eructations bility i meinhard this is making to day
28.95,36.21, my name is billy i'm the senior brand director on sweets and refreshment brands at the horseman
36.24,68.43, congrats for he don't go to when i read this because it's a little long one a new media model that transform a brand usirmari got that right anisette brangaena little bit about what was the campaign the campaign was just a new idea a fresh idea for the jelly ranch brand that you know everybody has known in love for many many years and we were trying
68.58,73.92, come in sight with a brand on it and you know one thing we heard was that
74.1,84.84, he is the brand that you say you know when you're in the suck boarding situations and so really came from a powerful consumer insight linked to a really
85.02,185.1, strong usage occasion for the brand and we created the campaign keep on sucking with jollier answer can't really be that line pretty memorable what kind of olden where there are along the way i mean to take on this issue of sucking orientation to be one of those brand stephanotis from media standpoints well content development standpoint so you know sometime campaign that was inattention not producing fifteen second spots you know we're going to go where the consumer is which is obviously much more digitally based and our campaign idea with the fruit getting which is anterior you know banishing over repentance means
185.16,200.79, dale that i mean partners had to be a big component of it it's a lot of content to create a lot to manage you know we actually hired new partners for this anomaly is our creative agency her baedeker
200.97,233.43, he intentionally to help us and help push us and evolve us along with um armenia agency so we were between anomaly and un we had to have a really strong partnership not just between those two but also the branding markethouse partners
233.52,290.22, one aspect of the campaign was responding and social media with personalized response you know from a brand control standpoint that could be a little scary and you know the watercourses to show up and have one to one dialogue with consumers on line but we had obviously rapidly change how we sought approval you know for content that were promoting so we created like a box and said within this box all this stuff is fair game these are the things we should be talking about these are the ways that we should be talking about
290.58,298.23, with consumers and so you know we define that with the agency and also with our internal
298.74,309.18, monitoring team as well and so we had a rapid approval process and frankly as long as they were within the box you know we felt pretty confident that it was not going to be a problem
309.3,366.87, talk about this box that you built to rapid response i mean that's an innovation in itself but you know i'm sure some things needed to be outside the box and how far silenced legal representation as well so by having that teaspoon solidaire something you know is a little different willowdale able to still be nimble not within
366.93,396.36, before this we were spending a lot of time you know waiting for teams to meet and review content and we'd have like weekly meetings that we would set some content to and we still have those for you know things that don't require such rapid responses but we have like i said i kind of transformed our presence so it was really organise
396.48,472.29, it possessours like almost a swat team that's looking over what's going on in the world you imagine it's also a sort of insight and absolutely as that drive the brand or he falls is one component we also have our agency partners both as well as a normal reconnoitring and you know heatherpoint then also the insight and the reporting that we never had before with regard to engagement and
472.62,478.23, and just sort of reach and sentiment has really come a long way in the last months
478.53,495.39, winning and things about maronites how do you define it well marketin to me is really about just motivating people right so whether your motivating them to laugh whether your motivating the to say like owther your motivating them to say
495.42,526.29, come on your post or by a product right it's all come with you have to do things and you have to market to consumers in a way that motivates them because just showing up is only part of the game right so that's really what we're trying to do is not only something to know the person across from me and you've reached the level of success in your career is there a moment in your past that the fines metacom
526.35,572.61, actually this campaign has been pretty career defining for me so you know there as it was i've been here a number of years and you know i've been more araminta traditional marketable for me as a marketable it's just requires a different set of stone 
572.79,597.06, one knows now as they are favored part o the job you get now honestly my favourite figure part of my job right now is going on line usually landed go hallooing at the social feed of jelly rather and just hearing consumers you know talk to us engaged with us you know like tell us which favors their favorite labor tell us that you know like you know
597.45,599.88, they're really interested in you know
600.24,605.4, these types of flavors and how they use the product and just hearing the brand
605.43,623.91, communicate in a very appropriate one with them and you know it's really fun to watch it's almost like a little sick come with our characters going back and forth so that really one of the most enjoyable part of my hastening that surprised you going through this process the evolution of your
624.0,654.0, two young kids so it didn't surprise me that you know younger consumers really expect an want to engage but it was sort of surprising how willing consumers were to sort of just like jumpin on stuff and start talking about jolly rancher and why grape sucks and why i really like blue raspberry and why water melon i wish i had a bag just with water melon and all of those sort of like you know consumer conversations that
654.18,660.36, happening but now you're actually you know involved in that conversation and hearing at first hand which is really cool
660.75,677.91, but learning that marketers are students of the business so are their brands that you follow or you think other people should be taking notice of these days i mean there's just a lot of brands that you know you respect over the years and i think one of the keys to
677.91,684.18, to make sure that you are evolving you the way that you connect with consumers
684.69,695.64, and you know obviously some of the new brands you know like apple and amazon are sort of like the early while the really powerful brands you know because they have a really powerful
695.67,731.4, communication and connection with the consumers but you know being in here and being one of those brand there being one of those marketers had marketed legacy brands i tend to look at oroondates the test of time and been marketed really well and i look at conversion of those great bayonet
731.4,735.48, you see as the most important opportunity for marketers today
735.66,744.06, i really think the opportunity is in making sure that your connecting in a way that is
744.15,816.81, right for the consumers so it's not like you know the days of look at this and look at this and look at this at a sort of over certainly we want them to see stuff that we produce but we also want to hear from them we want to be engaging in the conversation and the dialogue because that's really when i think restoration ship with the consumer is when they're actually almost like being heartily now and melted over again you know shouldn't alister that you wrestling with today to content development obviously content is in making sure that you have really strong content that cuts through cobleskill struggling and trying to figure out the way to develop really strong rich content in a very nimble and cost effective way
816.81,823.5, and fewer to have your crystal ball out in front of you you know would you predict for the future of marking where do you think it's going to 
823.56,837.15, i honestly see a lot of like turning brands were to consumers and user generated content you know something that were really interested in and you know ingrassatu
837.15,850.8, create with our brand is something that i see as a next evolution of just consumer engagement right so you know from second you know consumption of tad to online engagement to
850.86,860.16, consumer actually creating something with you or for you i think that's the next chapter of consumer engagement
860.28,869.49, oh thank you so much for it now with me in thanks for having me
