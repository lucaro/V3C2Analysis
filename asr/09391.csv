0.3,15.66, as the chariot cooking things that take a little time a little effort to to make him come out right
15.96,19.86, of coming something that takes hours and have it come out perfect

21.99,46.32, in the breasts and cook it may to annie comforter six hours he would till then and at the bottom the smoke goes up the round and as a fan and and around which circulates the smoke in captivitie chamber before i goes out i use the molasses crime
46.32,47.61, the brisket
48.06,62.28, and that started out life several years ago as a stray bride i did the same for several years at another restaurant and then when i moved here the strongest exactly fitteth southern barbecue them
62.4,72.87, i took out a lot of the chemicals and the pink salt and some of the other things and just made it a straight molasses salt and sugar in
73.02,74.19, the brisket
