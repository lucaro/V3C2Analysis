18.75,44.19, i have a friend who is an artist and is sometimes thinking of you which i now agree with very well you hold up a flower and say the camouflage and he says you see as i was an instance how beautiful is it but you as a sin is old take the oil upon and becomes dull thing and i think that he is kind of nuttiest of all
44.4,55.2, but if he sees is available to other people and to me too i believe quite as we find as esthetically as he is but i can appreciate the beauty of a flower
55.8,74.94, the same time i see much more about the flower is i could imagine so the complicated actions since i would draw have a beauty i mean is not just beauty at this dimensionless also beautifool of them ancient the instructor also the processes the fact that
76.23,81.93, and the flower or in order to attract insects to palliate it
82.08,95.43, interesting it means the insects can see the color it as a question is the asthetic sense also exists in the law of one that had lost why is that in all kinds of interesting quests
95.94,97.26, science
97.47,106.2, knowledge only needs to the excitement of mister beale it only as i don't understand how it tract
109.59,118.71, if you expected since to give all the editors to the wonderful questions about what we are or where we're going what the meaning of the universe is and so on
118.86,129.06, but i think i could easily become the solution on tanoo for some mystical how a scientist can take mister anton now because the whole spirit
129.15,134.79, i deleterious and but anyhow 
135.0,172.8, it the way i think of what we're doing is weeping the train of fingers much as we can about the world people say to me i looking for the ultimate the laws of physics no i'm not i'm just looking to find out more about the world than if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains emily so be it that would be very nice covertures out is like an onion with millions of lawyers and we just sick entire on looking at the last then that's the way it is but what a way it comes out its nature is there and she's goin to come out the way she is and therefore when we go to investigate we shouldn't pre decide what it is we're trying to do except to find out more about it

213.99,219.45, and so on together i can't believe the special stories that have been made up
220.02,224.16, a relationship to the universe of lies because
225.06,226.26, seem to be
228.18,244.44, too simple too to collect to local to prevent the earth became to the earth one of the aspects of god came to the end and operator there how can it isn't in proportion
247.44,265.17, it's no use since it i'm just trying to tenderhearted should look to see what true and one may be may not be true once you start doubtin which i think is to me as a very fundamental part of it so as to do
