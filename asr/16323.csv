1.68,23.34, leatherface to israel or as many people call it
23.34,24.6, holy land
27.3,38.7, israel is a land of many things it is a land of diverse geographical regions it is a land of beauty
38.79,64.56, it is a land of war it is a land of rich culture and history but may be most importantly it is a land of religion israel is habited by many different religious groups the jews muslims christians and drew
66.51,76.41, for centuries these distinct groups of people have lived together both peacefully and violently but nevertheless together in a country no bigger than the size of new jersey
77.82,83.64, many unwarranted syria types have been attached to these people sometimes based on religion and heritage
83.76,103.95, as a country that many people assume is backwards but as it really one way to find out is by asking the particular group of people who are frequently stereotyped the women but first it may be important to get a feel for what other people outside of the country think and regards to how women in israel are treated in today's world
112.38,157.89, they defer that they don't have as many rights the innovation of a repeater is no freedom of speech or anything like that so i'm sure the women are better off here daily and other trees like you have to be quiet and not speak of their opinion i guess he really conservative and hid their bodies sufficient allowed to be people to there's a fighting there roderigo certainly not heliotrope
158.01,166.2, so let's get some fact straight the jews make up seventy five point six per cent of the israeli population a clear majority
167.01,177.3, as consists of point nine percent portions are a small two percent and dress make up just one point seven percent of the israeli population
178.17,193.53, although his real is a small country it would be very difficult to meet with women from every city so instead let's see aloo inside one particular area that is full of mixed villages including jews and arabs of all faiths welcome to western galli
193.56,205.29, the first things first we should knock out the stereotype that all women must be covered up in head cloths and long skirts
205.44,211.95, some of them are but others feel perfectly fine with revealing their bodies as much as any other american would
215.52,223.11, first group of women we meet along this journey are the jews was conservative and liberal these women have much to say on how they are treated
223.2,232.65, to the religious jew means living according to allah
237.84,247.2, how combing the world of law of the 
247.5,255.66, defining the way in which you do things and really regards everything
255.96,278.04, we do in our lives from saying a blessing before eating something to how we conduct business to everything so considered myself a religious person who follows that haliotis person i mean
278.28,282.51, do not follow without
286.56,296.64, the temptation i do not believe in god and maintain the joys
300.12,301.05, the
301.11,303.18, not follow any
304.56,308.76, it came from the jewish
308.76,321.36, station of religion from a amparitos jewish person i'm not very religious but i like candles on friday night and i firmly believing god etcetera
325.95,336.63, on the one hand on the hand i believe in one god so i mean a a a said that i'm jewish but it doesn't really matter i believe in the same god that he believes him
336.84,338.37, believing in god
338.79,342.15, well i was born in the mind
342.75,347.76, with a very scientist conscious family
352.02,365.91, my grandfather was the head of the danish jewish community my father was vice president my mother was the first woman in the lessons of the community
366.03,381.33, not at all religious i would say more or less of a grew up without religion what many people outside of israel don't know is that most us some say close to ninety per cent are secular and non religious
381.33,403.02, many of these israeli citizens do not consider their country to be religious judaism is not just not just a religion that a people and that and it's a people with the land i am quite sure that the way i know america america is much much more really dispensator this is my experience
403.32,408.72, the way i see americans from the years that i spent there
409.2,415.77, most everybody in america has something to do with the church or with the senior
415.83,418.41, just your way of life
418.53,431.82, the overhead completely different like most of the people that i know never go to a single and there is almost nothing in our life that has anything to do with
432.6,434.37, religion
435.36,441.51, next group of women are the muslims some are very strict while others are much more modern in their practices
441.66,451.08, the satellites
457.02,465.87, this same marshalmen gives a habituated
467.31,504.78, the gunman can it be in so leslie began a little huddled visitable she recoiled with a share matson with a small competence with two men within the assembly led them she laetitia that way if he mismanagement and italy
509.07,515.04, that is ashamed casually the
515.4,546.0, the realisation adulteration the mahabharata helvetius alas are was aroused another molecule had a military ciannetella vacuously
546.33,557.61, said the visitor vegetable chase and he came bothering me i the air
557.73,560.16, and shall
561.12,571.02, and the one abatement of him at the connotations
575.4,585.39, another and a camaraderie of shebbeare but a beaten
585.84,591.87, a sublimated the anteroom she put salvolatile
592.53,613.74, one may annihilate battleships had done casablanca a really a camaraderie the insulated hope she shall be said the helvetian to use
614.97,619.98, christian women do not necessarily define themselves as being religious or non religious
620.07,622.38, say they're simply christian
622.74,633.09, as i say those religious christian and unresisting
638.07,649.74, at least not in their nothing even in the whole world if you cistertian go to church on sundays i too hot to pray
649.83,675.54, but depends on soon how you choose to live your christian life you choose to be more close to our community and have all the rules and all the things everyone else does belonging
679.56,700.35, i like a religious way of life incrustation i like it very much i think religious an aim let let you have answers for all these questions and literate in certain way let not be confused with all the way of life
703.05,705.18, i chose to reliance
705.39,710.76, society is not one that many people know about because they belong to a secret religion
711.36,724.23, it is a secret but it theatrically very 
725.34,726.63, but
732.6,744.66, and what my wife in everything that he could inside a society from behavior to nor
744.78,758.52, throw it now i want to explain festival a few sentences in english and then i want to tell you more about a roscommon in hertha you can explain the
762.72,769.65, okay i that the roscommon we are 
772.53,775.2, we have a section
775.32,780.54, and there are we believe in the incarnation
780.6,787.5, and we've believe every person who bore like as a rose
787.56,789.36, the
789.87,796.02, and we cannot accept any body to come to the security
796.2,801.57, these women come from different backgrounds that both they and conformed modern stereotypes
801.81,810.45, their different viewpoints how do they define themselves and each other in the world to day it's a country where you look at 
810.75,819.96, insatiability or from the first thing that everyone who doesn't know you who want to make so intense will ask and
820.23,822.36, how you first defined
822.57,826.14, in israel the religion is a critical issue
826.44,848.7, jewish man races in israel is based on jewish amused i think in israel in general we all suffer all of us all suffer from really not knowing that much about about the other the will i get innstetten that dear as any case
849.03,858.96, the malachite that year as the lilloise as they chiloteca
859.32,867.9, as echinodermata rose it archaeologian nose he would not quilleash had a bad machine
868.2,871.38, then i shut her so he
871.44,881.7, he the poet the point he hoisted nauhtlan and declared because we shall be among helaman and looked possible
884.22,898.86, clearly there are stereotypes against women and religion not just from other countries but within israel itself but really it depends on the individual as to whether or not they see religion as a good or bad thing for society
898.95,907.41, as a result even though people may share the same religion each individual has a different opinion on whether religion brings happiness and freedom or not
907.62,909.96, take a little of the jewish perspective
910.8,924.36, there are troops attract so probably everybody will are not true certainly to jewish women and certainly didn't religious social winesour that fell a lot of things are perceived as things that 
924.45,929.46, women down or home woman back most of the time i don't say it that way
929.7,935.31, the jewish way of treating their relation to it was toting women
935.4,937.62, just i do not accept the
938.07,949.71, and i do not want to be accepted as a jewish woman i think that from the religious point of view you've got a very big place of respect for the for the mother to
949.98,952.71, in the end she is the most she's the queen
952.89,962.55, the husband is formed whatever but the mother is like from her children and her husband she's the queen
962.82,970.8, the religion does discriminate i remember my two older voice polite
970.83,972.3, really offended me
972.45,973.56, like
973.83,988.41, the mother of the metre and a malouin where the one thing is i sometimes i like to call it limitations there are there are defining moments sometimes those things 
990.18,992.49, to find differently than they are for men
992.76,995.7, do not care very much to show
995.73,997.68, we are one
998.01,999.63, one has to be
999.75,1002.09, most the time i don't say it that way
1002.36,1004.28, i like this
1007.1,1017.75, you know i'm more or less anti religious because it's being forced to unpeople i don't mind people being religious
1017.81,1037.25, whatever degree they want to do it as long as they leave me to do it to my degree and that's not the case the moslim community has been criticized all over the world for many reasons most people believe religious muslim women are not happy because they feel these women are not given the same rights as men
1037.4,1047.87, that how all muslims both religious and secular it bureaucratic marashi milieu
1048.05,1084.56, the catholic is coming that the isolated faisaient bomilcar had a male moose and manylodes and me whereto i simoniacal hagadas foremastman blithesome
1085.55,1092.99, her husband can take four wires and she's just one of them she has no say in the matter whatsoever sicknesses just
1093.2,1148.16, object of her she's a slave but caracalla a philistine i get me a tortoiseshell binocular voyage i have last elecampane curable again had that day with the emaciation heldon reiterated the man my besetting aloneness retaliate on seeming to eratosthenes
1148.64,1158.87, within the christian faith religion still sets borders on how people live their lives however some see this in a negative way while others see the benefits
1159.35,1183.44, the times it's not fair to say that it is always most of the time bring it in customer life in a non positive way the open way of modern life everything is open everything to her to have some porters and how to feel and i see the religion even contribute for the good
1183.98,1196.25, they have some orders in your life i did see the limitation that other women are facing and decided that i will not even face them because i will just do what time
1196.4,1224.06, and whenever i wanted and carry wise and in everything girls may be in my person i i like to have bonover thing is open or everything is taken imisee it unable in good way not in a bad way religion has its own limitations and the points of four and how women and they nassau live
1224.93,1230.12, inside the secret of russety women are not given the same opportunities as men
1230.15,1239.54, many jews women have very positive outlook on the future of their culture and realize that education is key to the development of women the anger
1239.66,1253.76, it's only with a climate from anything that is outside the society is not like the boys lespoisse a beauteous
1254.0,1255.89, she had lost

1307.13,1308.9, and academic
1309.65,1311.27, what
1311.33,1315.17, countermand success all some
1315.95,1317.69, to forget
1317.75,1337.67, i'm a groseman education is there the note man kay only there i can say also that the men were hard for those caretto shortened the show that they are garbutt are also members very important commerce in society
1338.09,1349.4, there is no way to determine whether one viewpoint is better than the other religious and non religious people alike must learn to accept the other's lifestyle and become more open minded
1350.0,1359.75, being jewish gives people an advantage in the workplace over the arabs that's the way racism works in israel i think george women have more opportunities
1359.99,1361.31, a woman

1402.14,1404.18, and quickly saw
1404.6,1415.37, the tone should that they were given a bad deal every one has their own opinion on religion many women are happy with their lives while others are not
1415.46,1418.85, maybe that's the real question are these women happy
1419.36,1427.67, i return happy i am i think so i think so i think of it i think of the woman around me
1427.7,1431.87, the word environmental friends or whatever
1431.93,1443.54, general i don't think you can make a generalisation like that the women who accept it are the people are unhappy always
1445.43,1448.04, i say i know a lot of happy people
1448.19,1489.35, i hear the cannon lahainaluna a morose moorland instability unimitated tuberosities or they had been and he louisiana at the homage to the legate at goettingen

1523.61,1532.31, no one is indecent about tenderly and not a sederson he is incarnate
1532.34,1536.87, like a general saying sonnay

1567.08,1575.0, they need to be the state at home a matelote some things so you can't say a woman a happy
1575.45,1588.53, solitaire igion aside being a woman in israel can be very challenging even in to day's society there is no equality between men and women but there is hope for a future
1588.56,1596.03, in america there's no quality yet and the same goes to his own to
1596.09,1607.88, women have to fight really for each and every very small step that we done
1609.08,1611.81, maybe he probably
1612.17,1617.84, as very much a man's world you know very military orientated
1618.08,1622.49, men and nothing but the 
1623.06,1632.9, prior and positions very easily no matter how much we want it to be a western country this is still the middle east
1633.11,1647.63, and a lot of the things i mean this combination against women are much less alisal the lenten boring countries but if you compare to the other countries that i lived in then mark
1647.99,1650.42, united states

1677.45,1681.11, say oh it's not the woman we may drop
1681.35,1685.46, a long process but women are not anywhere equal right now
1686.3,1693.68, as far as i can see but it is getting better in the land though i'm getting more used to it had gone
1695.66,1715.01, looking past stereotypes disagreements and problems israel is still a home for all of these people a place where family and history unite israel would be mahomet place in the world recoiling the cattery right in the world to be there
1715.43,1722.39, i think i rascality because every one of the countries that wavering
1722.54,1737.24, beautiful country is full sibutu country it is a hundred per cent modern growing prosperous even country what i believe that in israel
