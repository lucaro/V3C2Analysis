16.08,25.38, then your family had a successful summer in any and always that you define success my guest to day is narakans
26.01,31.47, as a writer and teacher and has been working with young women for over fifteen years
31.47,51.09, she is the author of beautiful being an empowered young woman and the founder of beautiful project a curricular initiative dedicated to building self confidence among adolescent girls and young women the only works with educators parents mentors and young people for work is a call to attention
51.36,54.75, recognize that we are the creators of our culture
54.96,59.37, he focuses on empowering ourselves to take action into her own hands
59.46,62.13, understand that we are the builders of our culture
62.22,83.1, then we drive the changes that we wish to see beginning with ourselves and echoing into our communities before we get to our pieces i'd like to apologize for the fact that this boast is audio only my guest nay cats lives in israel and the distance was wreaking havoc with sky and the internet connection
83.25,84.78, the audio is great
86.25,88.74, the welcome to family confidential
88.86,141.66, i annie how are you doing great things so nice to see you and i appreciate your staying up late because i know you all the way in israel and here i am in the west coast of the u s and it's not even not a clock in the morning so we're going to make this happen right before we start recording we were talking a little bit about the inner critic that we all have inside of us living kicking that makes it kind of hard for us to move selective surface or in the situation of a capering session to get past not looking at our image on the screen so i'm wondering if you can because of going to be talking a beautiful project and how are all kind of prisoners of this inertia we learn to tone it down just a bit
142.14,188.67, i think the first thing we need to do is really admit and recognize its existence and also admit and recognize the extent to which that in terrific really affect us in effect ourself in age and to patteson to the way that that critic makes a salmatoris because language is really powerful and so even i see myself and i see something i don't necessarily love which happened i can talk about it in a way to make an improvement or i talk about it in a way that that's really misamis myself and i just painful and then i just carried out painite for the the day or week or year so of course it's really difficult to see my own image and being somebody else but
189.57,221.49, really an exercise in accepting accepting who i am have to love what my body looked like what my hair looks like a just understanding that each of us carries our own beauty and to recognize that instead of feeding the interpretin which is sometimes but we do culturally no tattwa you're saying it is wise and i know from my own experience in from talking to middle school and high school age girls even younger that that critic
222.78,231.27, so powerful i think that obviously the external messages that we as girls and women get
231.33,248.25, not helping to do anything else but to embolden that critic and so when you say to know that you are beautiful and how you know im it's so much easier to find fault
248.25,254.31, well i think that what you're saying about the external message is really important
254.46,267.51, and if something that don't really give enough credit to even though those messages are everywhere and so to recognize and to talk as adulterator friends and also with our daughters and students really
267.54,298.59, about the impact of those external messages the impact they have on making us feel bad about our bodies and our appearances in general the way that they teach us to sexual ize and objectify ourselves and once we can be real about that about the impact of those messages then we can also say okay how do i really want to see myself how do i really want to carry myself in this world because i don't want to carry myself though this world with judgment all the time sometimes i admit and happens
298.95,310.71, i think that the more i can be real about the welsh in fact the more i can improve my own personal situation and subsequently the relationships that i have with other women because that critical
310.74,319.44, not intended to be plain words but there was no relationship to really crucial and he moved myself the more unlikely to judge the other women around me
319.47,329.31, i need those women at my friends we all need each other and particularly at lester neither friends and so to really be real about the impact of a criticism
329.37,347.97, that that's my blowing you just said that the idea is the more critical we are of ourselves the less likely we are to be to feel connected bonded and on the same team as the girls and women around us so when
347.97,380.31, i am imagining a sixth grader new to middle school feeling insecure as most limours bureaus are on lots of levels and the she's maybe with some friends from elementary school but with a whole bunch of new girls in everybody's eyeing each other and there is that discomfort and i measure not that that question what does that girl do for herself in that moment to kind of hold those feelings
380.31,424.8, what are your suggestions for her and most of the people who will be listening here will be parents and teachers and counsellors who work with this age group all the time and i think helping prepare grandboys for those discomforts and trot awkwardness and for that moment when were loaned to judge ourselves to help them be aware that that moment may come and to prepare them by cultivating tools to deal with that moment can be really realise and so for example to recognize okay i see these other girls around me and in my opinion may be there nor beautiful skinner attracting more attention from the boys et cetera such a sutra
425.01,426.6, how do i feel
426.81,428.85, what do you with that feeling
429.03,432.06, necessarily have to feel self conscious
432.33,442.53, i do is that completely stop me from reaching out to other girls and meeting new friends as that completely stop me from raising my hand and class though
442.71,457.89, one thing that i have noted many different contexts with marius agents of people whom my work is that we're not so necessarily good at even naming the emotions that we feel around these different situations and then dealing with those emotions
457.92,470.04, prepare kids and really let him know o this might happen and if it does then what might you do what are your options in that moment a lot of girls will tell me the dislike they want to hide
470.37,483.21, want to remove themselves in the situation which i interpreted an i want to remove myself from this judgment i also find that it's interesting that middle school age girls
483.51,515.85, well perceived maybe more judgment coming at them than there actually is you know i joke with them and say i think what is often the case is that other kids in your in your class or so busy worrying about how baloney are they are less likely to be looking at you they are always looking over their shoulder and and you've got this this mass of inky and in measuring up
516.96,526.5, unhealthy to say to say the least as some one who works with young girls and young women i'm wondering
527.58,530.16, what the first severest like
530.16,563.13, giving the other options they know that i want to hide or sometimes there's a defensiveness they will bring down another girl near by to deflect tension from themselves while alison as ugly as she is or at least my hair is prettier than her putting other people down with the idea that will raise myself a team that doesn't work but but the idea of the there other options there are healthier options they are options that actually can buy your spirits 
563.13,573.54, you can get into the habit of going there instead o how about some other options from the ones that we typically might go to out of defense or fear
573.69,574.92, sure
575.07,587.04, i like to work with girls kind of initiation on two different levels one is the personal level and in that moment where i want to hide i want to shut them out i want to run away to stop
587.04,605.58, we don't really stop that much in our society were always kind of go go go and if we stopped for a second and i worked with students teaching the retreating exercise is or journalier cise or really just taking a pause even if it means you know even if you're in school and in the middle the whole situation of kids just go to the bathroom
605.58,641.61, a breath for a second and remove yourself briefly from that situation to kind of recollect yourself and in that of recollecting yourself connecting back to a set of tools of that work mining over time to be able to help you deal with that moment and then tapping me to sort of de second level which is that i would read a work with girls and women to look at the language that we use the palette and understand the culture that we create around ourselves because we create the culture in which we live absolutely there are external horses in the media has a huge influence but really
641.76,676.23, i create the dialogue in my circle of friends in my family in my school classroom by the way that i speak and by the way that i interact with other people and that really empowering in stressing to recognize that night now you're talking about leadership you talking about change he took you out one person in a circle of girls who has his relocation that she's contributing to or allowing permitting this destructive culture within her circle of friends and that if she has 
676.26,683.88, mindfulness about it that she can in a way educating lead her friends away from that
683.88,685.23, i
685.23,706.08, absolutely and i don't have to feel like something heavy that you know some girls will say will not leader or unquiet took her the way that you speak about yourself in the secrets of your own room in front of the mirror the way that you speak to your friends the way to you speak to your parents those all have an impact
706.08,738.99, really contained the culture in which you said let talk a bit about what happens when we stop trashing ourselves and each other and worthy potential joys and benefits that we could get as a community of women while one of the things that i have really worked the cultivated my own life and really try to inspire my students and my montees and my peers the cultivate is really detracting relationships with other women
738.99,771.0, because of the way our culture is and the cannon and that we have to compete with one another and to judge one another we lose really important relationships particularly our elder women but just in general with other women or girls in our lives and so if i can stop or at least recognize the impact of the judgments than i can hope at different kind of connection with the people around cause if this other girl in my class is unwise mire
771.12,774.48, can react to her by thinking why am i not more like her
774.63,812.16, then probably will want to judge her or i can say you know she has some qualities that i really respect and admire i'm going to see if she wants to come over to my house or at lunch with me and then i opened a new door he closed it yearly cultivate relations with socrates i have a sense of support around me that can really help me in all different kinds of situations including that difficult moment that we spoke about earlier when we all probably want to run away and hide and if if you feel like you've got someone who understands some one that you can be totally honest with then
812.52,824.04, you run to that person not away from the other people you feel like you can stand your ground and in that you're not alone i love what you're saying to me
824.07,831.06, it besancon levels and i would be really interested in in
831.75,836.43, talking to me for a couple of minutes now about the role of mom
836.61,838.11, how they can
838.17,840.69, help their daughters move more
840.78,857.19, in this direction thank you for asking me that because i think that the role of man cannot be over estimated and i my mom passed away years ago sir and i thank you and i
857.22,864.93, bring that up because i cognize in my childhood and in my lessons a maying she was but now even more than ever
865.2,884.07, i see that she has taught me that help me be the woman that i am to day and that relationship of inspiration coming from our man is true for every girl and every woman because mormons are are primary remodel of what it means to be a woman and so
884.43,895.32, for example one question that i got a lot as well how can i talk to my daughter about body image when i myself don't feel so great about my body to question that i should
895.32,903.72, i understand i face the same thing and the thing that i really feel support me is to be honest
904.02,910.26, look together at those images that are painful and caused me to be judgment and say you know
910.53,926.85, i don't like those images i don't want dress at super sexual way i don't really appreciate the kind of femininity that she's portraying not necessarily in a critical eye but just to say it doesn't represent who i am as the woman or how i want answered
927.03,928.83, erastus
929.22,934.8, stand each of us are separation ship with our daughters to understand how
934.89,939.21, we want to carry ourselves or how do we carry ourselves as women
939.48,942.57, and the honest and true with that
942.69,977.58, and that will reflect will be reflected back to us in the girls that we meant or whether art there are daughters or students or armies or whoever they may be and so what you said at the beginning in the idea of being honest with your own response to your reflection in the mirror to be more aware of that inner critic though at the time we had that that piece of the conversation were talking about girls it sounds also that for most be the kind of positive leaders and roll models and mentor that
977.64,982.5, their daughters need from them they need to be part of that process themselves
982.62,1030.86, lately because we're all affected by the way that women are being portrayed to day and the more we can talk of play with ourselves and with our friends and here we come back to the kind of relationships we as the dogs women have with other women the more we can talk openly with others the more consumedly with our daughters and with our men teeth and with our students and the same is true about we were saying about efficiencies if i'm not close friendships with other women to the young women around me they will recognize the value of that as well if i model relationships with elder women to the young women around me they will see the importance of that she and another piece of it that i can't resist mentioning is the way that we initiate our girls to womanhood
1030.98,1041.96, because when we talk about adolescence were really looking at that moment when a girl is making the transition from being a girl to being a woman or a boy becoming a man
1041.99,1047.96, in our culture i wonder what does that mean and
1048.41,1049.82, it means
1049.91,1052.43, become a woman to day
1052.7,1054.65, men in to become a man
1054.92,1059.72, mean to put really sexualis pictures of yourself on social medium
1059.93,1063.53, i mean to have a boy friend or have a girl friend
1064.7,1078.83, what kind of womanhood do we want to introduce our girls into and how that's a whole other question and it's one that i would love to explore at you and at another time because
1078.92,1080.75, just described
1080.78,1091.28, sounds to me like for motherhood to needing a boyfriend to posting sexual pictures on social media all of these have to do with other
1091.43,1098.69, and the idea of who we are as women while we're transition ing into becoming a woman
1098.93,1111.44, should i think for a foremost be a question of who am i not in relation other people but who am i am religious to to myself in relation to myself and also in relation to my mom
1112.22,1180.5, how what am i learned from her and what qualities do i want to emulate and laquoite when i like to be different you know how it bedient from her and in that sense rethondes anding how do i define my sense as a woman what you're saying annie is absolutely true and really really important to think of it great okay well we've got just about another minute now my and in that time i would love for you to give our listeners in power and opportunity to learn where they can learn more about your work on the web rethink you can go and visit my website beautiful project not mean i would also be really happy as any women who are listening at tourcaty avanti is actually a virtual women circle you can find more information on the site where we will talk really of how this almost the same issues that were talking about to day and the interview one of the men as to be beautiful and what does it mean to us to be a woman and i also checkpoint of the website please thank you so much for the worth that you do namesake and i know from
1180.5,1203.18, my experience with twenty first century girls that they need more and more of these kinds of opportunities to talk and explore and to stretch their definition of what it means to be beautiful when it means to be a girl or a woman so i thank you very much for your work thank you somehow a beautiful day
