20.67,55.05, strong in organization causes which is the council for information on tranquilizers we also deal with anticyclonic and pain killers to advising providing information and unsupporting peoples and the process of coming off these jugs would be around to one year i understand that my real horses discussion and i introduce you first of all to professor ashton thangobrind to animation
55.26,68.76, we are also going to be talking at this station and then i think we'll go on professor he lives he is well i denoting we're going to have a discussion which i think we all say forestry the most useful thing to discuss
69.0,82.47, experiences on a spoor more productively what can actually be done about what is going on generally in the country and in the world to do with psychotic medication thank you
83.43,89.25, the stars are granite i ran a
89.34,93.0, withdraw any hotel years
93.45,147.93, which was quite a planned but astro in a general pharmacology clinic in one day a lady came in who bennehoff accident and she was in plaster which had been put on out of and by the surgeons forbearance for masterton and she said you alicandro i'm started to crave every time the next doses is due i think i'm addicted can you help me when i was young and autonomy and i said yes i belisarius but after her there was a stream and then a flood a torrent of patience coming in saying these pentodon work any more they were superiors but now i'm getting more anxious and all sorts of other things and
148.08,150.81, so that undisturbed
150.93,158.4, volcanic just to mention facts doing it two sessions a week for years
158.49,160.26, no other
160.26,172.26, in that group wanted to take on those patients because they didn't like listening to people or erostratus enough you know this and that and
172.32,182.7, so the doctors got defensive so i got all those patients and i just listened and they tell me what to do and they told me about
182.85,192.51, and you know the way to do it and we had many chimaeras but not outlasted so its patient power that
192.63,202.92, move things and i'd be very interested when we've heard you anna you know with any questions and experiences that you had
204.75,214.74, but i do anacreontica rest and i've had a long standing interest in psychiatric drugs
215.25,220.38, so be on a night prefer horses or that it is for the film right right and
221.73,226.56, a score had a longstanding interest in psychiatric drugs 
226.98,268.65, i've been trying to promote the idea of looking at psychiatric drugs as drugs the scholastic drugs and trying to work out what they actually do to the body and and how the body responds to them rather than seeing them as there often portrayed as as disease treatment that just rectify and abound lying at the manitoolin suggesting as that instead of rectifying and an underlying abnormality drugs actually create an abnormal state they create an altered state and we were quite comfortable with that idea with things with drugs of abuse like alcohol and heroin and things like that but maybe not so comfortable with that idea with psychiatrist
269.91,274.11, the work have done on coming off so i hated
274.53,293.19, relates to two things have heather was talking about how patient power really demonstrated the addictive potential ventirose appears and it also has really demonstrated and david he has been very involved in this the edict potential overseers and really that has i think brought home to
293.19,313.59, to every one that alligators are potentially active that there are withdrawal effects the potentially withdrawal effects after coming off any sort of drug that that alters the way the brain functions including drugs that we wouldn't normally think of us kept
315.3,317.73, and i looked at the literature on
317.76,330.99, coming of antiseptic drugs and there being some suggestions over the years that some people when they come of antibiotic drugs getter a slight coricao which is induced by the withdraw
331.08,335.64, and this idea of bein around in the literature for about years but
336.24,361.35, not really very not really accepted or believed so i collected together all the literature on that and managed to convince myself any way that this certainly does occur and i think it occurs most frequently with clasped and the literature on positively makes it undeniable that there is there is something like this in quite a high proportion of people who come of closing and may be a lower proportion of people coming off other anticyclonic
362.67,366.84, and the other thing that interested me about
367.14,459.36, mansions is how often i think the main difficulties to coming off or to do with the the system and the importance of the system puts on taking drug treatment and i work with im a rehabilitation psychiatrist i work with people who have been her had cicatrice problems for many many years often very severe ones and who were on large amounts of drugs that they almost certainly don't need and haven't benefited from and yet it is very very difficult even to try and reduce those drugs because of the resistance from the staff and the whole system really and sometimes as well from the patients themselves who have been used to being very very drug for a many years and find it difficult to face the idea of life without drugstore of of drugstore medication and interestingly i felt the medical profession would probably say for the first worshipped but i occupation because i actually think the patient needs to have some information about what they are what they want to achieve and how they going to achieve it before they go to the doctor and before the doctor gets it wrong and they can then go in with armed with the information and then share it with the doctor of it that he satisfieth we have to actually get bit you know research or own stuff and then take it to the doctor who actually should be told how that information there
459.42,467.46, i think that's you know goes very well with what we're all saying with when i always is to tell my patience they should treat their doctors
467.7,471.87, the calories their car
471.96,478.32, there is an questions in inanities any prescribing doctor
480.24,489.18, you know sanctioning this treatment are there any side of facts doesn't interact with other drugs
489.51,497.94, anyhow effects that there's a miss somewhere because after all the doctor service in your body and is your body
498.0,505.74, so i think that the patient should have the right to know exactly what is desired
505.74,519.93, as naaman doctors use dogs just treatment you've got this so take that and then don't think what is in actually doing inside and that of course an interest for everybody and
519.96,521.07, colleges
522.21,535.02, we think is the problem that we look at these drugs in the wrong way not to drugs and peoples in psychosis in particular are not encouraged to see them as drugs and think of what they do to the body and
535.71,546.24, and how that might impact on symptoms but are simply trained to think right you have this problem undistracted and i don't think it's like that at all
546.96,568.53, he liked spontaneous into how these fucarandono and he was a collarette biancomonte
568.65,577.05, but socrates salivation and hesitant

633.45,637.65, they are able to ask the person fashions
639.18,640.14, he
640.74,650.46, well i think a lot people on benassis affected that way yet i mean you know there are lots soporific on the buttered many many people
650.52,652.38, who were able
652.41,680.04, questions and motivation vaither i should potentate i have recently re started giving doing training days for medical students in liverpool and and hoping to do it in a lot university's across the country but it is quite stilling to think that if i didn't do that they would actually get no information on an benzoated

689.19,693.3, the francoises northeast
693.45,702.21, etseastin and rejection much to stoop
702.6,721.62, tentatively at the back in a sorry immitigable the training that is enough that the knowledge bladesover the hereafter sort of research has not been done because all people have been concerned about is
721.77,732.06, is looking up you know it doesn't it affect these symptoms very marriages into and doesn't affect this particular receptor that we think is rather than to all the other receptors that
732.18,735.27, all the other effects are ignored
735.48,741.66, i know what sort of withdrawal when actions no drugs produce we don't know how long they go on for
741.69,753.84, you know they might persist when the drug many months or years even after the driver stopped orientating of weathered
753.87,759.81, he imaginative people know the courses
759.84,768.66, toleration to meteorological notes
772.86,783.33, the back in the gray conington points first of all as the career gesegneter to all services
784.05,789.21, a book stops with their really if you're trying to access poitevine
789.81,792.18, you've got a problem there
792.63,796.08, when a person presents for the problem
796.23,800.82, histories are taken and very very rarely are entering
800.91,805.08, investigated and properly tested and even if you give
805.26,806.88, the
808.53,825.63, or a dream or an detesting than i has the blood which is often found to be normal it doesn't actually test what's been metalized in us in the body and we have
825.81,827.97, we have cast home
828.0,831.78, when that private testing was done which was more appropriate
831.81,833.73, identified huge problems
833.82,835.08, explained
836.13,837.27, the
837.45,844.62, parent mental health symptoms but they were a physical origin due to a completely destructive harmonister
844.62,850.56, i would investigate it the pistol refusing to accept those test results
850.59,855.6, possidentes that so patience and families
855.72,865.26, compromise for mentally anyway having to go to the private sector and that dangerous in itself you have to be really responsible and very careful to make sure
865.32,868.65, do that responsible and that isn't easy
868.8,879.24, well he would like to underthtand drugs or talking about unmolesting about and if you want to
880.02,891.6, stop people talking about their symptoms quite a lot of distress can do that quite effectively hoarsely and sinister it you know obviously that's
891.63,902.01, really helping the underlying problem and i think we're not thinking clearly enough about what the real problems are and what drugs can actually achieve and i think we've got
902.25,908.31, completely overblown ideas about what drugs can achieve i think they can do some things they can reduce a rouser
908.46,913.83, and that can sometimes help reduce and anxiety some sorts of drugs
914.19,916.59, and
916.71,922.83, reduce mental arousal damped down to hallucinations and psychotic thoughts for a while
923.04,930.36, but i don't think that they were verse and a thing i don't think there is any drug that improves mood i don't ever any evidence that anything
931.95,935.37, other than the drugs that induced you forward in the short term
937.02,938.1, the
938.34,941.49, obviously it's really important to balance you know
941.88,948.12, a big question because if you're prescribing if you're prescribing that newland has harmful effects
948.66,953.46, i consented solitariness
954.63,964.02, just response to that question thanks very much or uncomplete agreed with you and it something i am really concerned about these at the moment it is
964.08,975.72, of minimizing the metabolic effects of a london and clasping and they say all the putting away but the reading to march and blaming the person when we know very clearly that these drugs increase appetites
975.81,984.93, i not only increase attitude this really strange craving for unfolding sweet incorporates and we know they do that
986.79,1009.68, but but i just want to make another point that i think one of the reasons that sometimes doctors don't listen to complaints is because they can't be ways do anything about them and i think we do have to acknowledge that there are limitations to what and that sometimes mother being asked to do things that that they are not able to do
1009.92,1017.96, wrong that they are not able to acknowledge that it would be better if doctors were better able to say well actually we can't do anything at all we can do is this
1018.65,1027.68, but i think sometimes they are being asked to solve things that that that it is it's not easy to solve and that they don't have the tools to solve
1027.95,1030.95, i think the realestate very often a denial
1030.98,1033.83, but i mean i find the space of straying
1034.01,1035.57, what
1035.87,1043.04, people see baldos temples and antipater so often in denial about that the drugs are actually producing
1043.07,1062.03, at aspects that patients are all presenting with and no amount of coaxing arguing with these wines dogs seems to bring them round to green with that and materialised him did come

1109.64,1112.97, while
1113.0,1119.96, you can tell us to in the night apelike this but these are the negative effect and that thus
1120.08,1123.8, profit as a choice elevation
1123.98,1128.84, the word to aeneas
1129.71,1133.94, going to conflict with my colleagues because i would do without
1133.94,1139.01, i would say you can take this but be taunting
1140.6,1142.55, something not
1142.61,1144.74, we have to tell people 
1144.8,1146.18, things that
1146.33,1155.99, say people from the system more than one way to instant what we can make malacology tentation
1156.29,1158.87, continuation
1159.05,1160.76, as well
1160.88,1189.44, but the diocese for people being proscribed alone when they blakely have a family history which shows that it has them into a taking time but my god replies who aragonese its mother died a few months ago from a harassing sixty five who father is is a diabetes and six months ago has prescribed a lancinating and unmaking mooseskin timorous with get him off the land appearing get his way down and
1189.56,1197.87, staircase it's a well known fact now that london has that effect and to give it somebody without family history
1197.87,1201.35, i own simplicity
1202.7,1207.77, two points arsenicated tattooed
1207.77,1231.89, students of cookies or from patients but nowhere not histories that we take a psychiatric history personations medical students had come back again details of that the patients are a totalitarian tonality seven but then when you get the trunk and a regiment described forefinger
1232.04,1238.94, montalembert are in other words is not included in the face sinister poking
1239.15,1244.67, the history from the bookshop was often overlain or decontamination textbook
1244.88,1247.61, the second point is
1247.61,1252.95, but is now about the drugs that he described in very basis
1253.34,1266.72, drugs because often withdrawal side effects from drugs out reichenhall lives we note that would disturb described earlier the rays of hand and a short acting essays like ferocity
1266.75,1272.9, actiniae such as travel that very pretty prescribed opiate in general practice
1273.23,1277.82, the patient after those drugs and possible affectation to
1277.82,1281.93, conversions of those groups of dotage of their life
1281.99,1292.52, i tramped to our somebody was trying to get somebody off by cavorting the ostable automatic to five hundred million rounds of day of tremor
1293.12,1306.29, there is plenty of literature a fatalist you could with those papers and meteor is ample to pretend it's almost impossible for somebody of but short attendance and operator
1306.56,1313.82, he did acceleration to
1313.88,1326.9, treasure be working in a diction that there were some addicts who preferred to come on their hero in go to bed for a week and get it over long with rather than go on methodical man of withdrawal and on
1326.9,1338.63, and not always sure that if it is onreasonable i think that he was as fattening fit
1340.16,1343.13, i sure people to come up makes
1343.25,1352.43, like this looking geometrical stopping but when whatever you know whatever which was dedicating it
1352.46,1354.44, some people 
1354.86,1357.74, difficult is to do that 
1357.77,1367.55, and you can't predict who is going to his going to be able to do that constant peaceable
1367.61,1376.28, i think we need to learn something from the area of the victor behavior and that faineant forgot long standing out all over problems
1376.4,1380.12, not helping them to re adjust to a drug free life
1380.27,1382.82, i think that that you know that people
1382.85,1387.44, been on sometime some of the same sort of help
1388.28,1391.94, this lady was a likeness
1391.94,1403.4, which is in bright yellow and black lace on all the impatient cupboards and out patients a sutra in shapeless there are no secrets about medicine
1403.43,1421.52, monasteries the wardance staff or contact farmers do in no secrets about medicines not in my experience not in my reason in the research in there are so many secrets which are not diable orchard to caress or services
