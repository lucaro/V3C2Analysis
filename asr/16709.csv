1.08,9.45, he and you yes you
9.45,11.22, that sound
11.49,16.5, o beautiful sounds at the sound he raging empire
16.92,20.82, calling you to come in just a little bit closer
23.58,33.42, and you join me around the camp fire because i have a little story to tell you and i goes something like this
53.76,57.96, everything all of this chaos and madness
58.08,61.83, began with the black from
63.18,67.32, it was just an ordinary day when the news reported a strange phenomenon
67.47,74.55, whispered black cloud hung steadily making its way toward the west coast of the country from over the ocean
75.42,78.81, really can't as you expect
79.71,84.81, wasn't hurting anyone except maybe the sailors and planes flying over the ocean
85.17,88.08, life for everyone else continued as normal
88.56,92.94, whenever the news were talk about what we now know as the black for
93.06,94.53, would not
94.74,96.54, mild interest
96.57,99.48, say something like oh yes interesting
99.72,101.19, be done with it
101.49,105.84, until the black folk had the west coast
106.89,111.27, cities on the sea side with a first be hit and covered with black for
111.9,114.39, news when crazy
114.75,121.32, every station frantically pointing the cameras for to capture footage of the unique event
123.33,128.1, always looked like a thick cloud of smoke to me instead of a city covering 
129.18,135.72, now said the boy from the outside world could contact anybody in the far
136.23,141.03, nationwide panic was beginning and i grew fast
142.14,147.15, people who had previously disregarded the black fog now look for was to leave the country
147.21,150.96, he reported that the black fog was still heading east
151.02,154.53, determined to do for the entire country
155.31,163.83, master of this magnitude they can be safely assumed that plenty of doomsday profits came forward with explanations
163.89,165.57, but the folks are
165.9,174.63, quickly became obvious to me that these profits of the apaches were nothing more than crazies to walk into the new stations from after street
174.81,180.93, every sunario imaginable was tall as a reason for the black fox existence
181.44,183.9, ah humanity
185.94,189.45, seeking a safe place to land the space
189.51,193.23, black fog was simple for me pelletan in the air
193.32,195.78, a publicity stunt tenement
196.2,200.16, it was the government using the fog for some
200.58,205.41, it was rising we had everything
205.59,208.62, none of the theory seemed to make sense
210.3,217.26, there's a few more days of chaotic news reports and then the black fog came to might
218.19,226.08, walking home at fateful afternoon turning a street corner to see my two story home come into view at the street
227.37,230.01, pass me a steady pace
230.61,240.18, toward me down the sidewalk was a mother being a baby tale with an intrusive boy running ahead of other cheerfully telling his mammy to hurry
241.08,244.29, grasses brian green in the warm on atmosphere
244.53,250.08, and there were only a few white clouds in the sky to the strength from the wild blue yonder above
251.34,256.29, a red car the side planted with a thick mud raised passe
256.89,262.59, bright and yellow arensky beaten down the world covering us in sunlight
263.49,266.07, anything i do remember from that day
266.19,268.35, as the car
268.98,270.33, suddenly
270.51,272.31, out of nowhere
272.79,276.21, dark giants stood up over the horizon
276.24,278.52, the city
278.7,280.95, not the sun
282.15,286.83, stopped in the middle of the road leading other cars to crash into the
287.07,288.93, people began to scream
289.38,293.01, some hysterical woman held in her
293.16,297.09, i looked up at the black fog blotting out the sky
297.96,303.12, swept over the city quickly shrouding me in a cave of blackness
303.75,313.35, stumbled through the fall unable to see my own two hands in front the world around me looked as though it were covered in smoke but i could breathe it in normally
314.34,316.23, people screaming
316.41,319.02, sound frightfully clear
319.83,325.86, was the screeching of times as can stopped and the grunting of meddlers other cars crashed into each other
326.49,331.38, in my mind i could picture the street has it been before the fog had
331.86,334.89, house was a few yards down across the street
335.28,337.5, i could find my way inside
337.83,342.15, the foot and safelier and leave the city
343.98,347.16, a walking toward my house on easily
347.49,350.16, still hearing people cruel
350.91,354.15, it was as though i become blind
355.14,361.14, my steps with care and tripped over a blunt object when i was half way across the street
361.35,365.01, clammy feet with my sense of direction disoriented
365.61,367.56, to my house was 
368.79,372.27, i gave it my best guess and made my way for
373.08,379.62, i had to walk around a part cared after tripping over the curb and falling onto the sidewalk on the other side of the road
379.62,381.81, strapping it
382.14,385.62, entirely sure it was my 
386.49,392.94, my way to the front door of the house and sighed in relief when i realized it my
393.51,396.54, hurried inside quickly closing the door
397.62,401.43, at hadn't got in in my house which i was thankful for
401.61,404.43, a little of it got in when i opened the door
404.46,406.38, i could still see
407.52,410.7, windows display nothing but black
411.21,414.57, it was as though i was standing in my house at night
414.81,417.66, stainless mind
417.99,419.55, down
419.58,422.01, a deep breath to come myself
422.19,426.06, on the t v and began to watch the new
426.96,432.06, nothing was being done about the black folk surely they would have reported it
432.51,439.47, and usanas were calm but to my dismay they had nothing to report
440.37,444.6, said the black fog was perfectly natural and explainable
444.63,453.72, said that the entire nation was being covered at an unbelievably quick rate and the president had been evacuated for his safety
454.74,460.29, change the channel right there cutting off a blond newson mid sent
460.35,464.55, no the new channel they weren't caught in the fog natural
465.18,467.76, they weren't talking about the president
468.24,471.81, he went pretending this wasn't a national emergency
472.38,475.47, instead they were panicking
476.79,484.32, like normal civilians ran around the station in a frenzy while the camera's view resting on a guesting behind the news desk
484.44,487.53, sitting in the middle of all the chaos
488.43,490.35, ease
490.44,492.96, trying to maintain a somehow
492.96,503.07, there are no report of her rescue from any cecidit not i the black fox shystering
503.22,504.78, guy was saying
505.53,509.25, as i walked the matto one of the frightened civilians
509.31,512.13, asked him to say a few things for the camera
512.91,515.7, but my name's hate
515.85,525.9, began breathing heavily as she terracina like a analostan else
526.08,529.38, what fierce is not
530.31,535.23, romance in a black fog if you have a flash light of a fire
535.47,541.08, out into fontainas come back here
542.1,547.02, i remained in my living room and complete disbelief that this was happening
547.74,552.57, barely registered anything in the new set not that it set the march
552.9,560.25, they could talk about was the black fall and because nobody knew anything about it i wasn't much to say
561.03,563.94, i couldn't tell if it was day or night outside
563.97,567.24, i tried to sleep according to the clocks in my house
567.87,570.66, slept on the hard wood floor in the living room
570.87,574.29, two weary and afraid climate
575.28,576.54, i woke up
576.69,579.57, i attention again
580.32,588.63, inside the new station there were sleeping people make with people standing off came who were in rapid discussion about what to do
589.26,592.2, it was as though the forgotten the camera was on
592.86,597.39, i decided to wait and see if they're going to give any piece of news that was worth while
597.48,600.54, i went into the kitchen to fix myself something to eat
601.14,605.52, fortunately i'd made a trip to the grocery store the day before it all started
606.24,610.71, despite this my appetite still wavered when i looked in the true
611.64,615.09, i didn't feel real to me
615.51,618.24, almost like some kind of demented nightmare
618.66,621.24, still her hand about
621.75,624.57, returned to the living room without eating anything
624.6,627.75, down on the couch and stared at the 
628.38,632.88, staring at the screen and listening to the people in the new station talk for an hour
633.15,635.31, i grew 
635.67,637.14, survival
637.41,639.15, boring
639.66,644.64, i had to the living room window and examined it from where i sat to kings
645.06,648.96, think adamant said something about being able to see in the fall with
649.92,653.94, i jumped off the couch and stumbled over to the hall closet
654.18,659.49, the suffering through coats and other miscellaneous things i found a flashlight
660.72,665.46, flicking it on my side and relief when a bright beam of light shot out
665.82,668.82, financial started
670.35,673.26, pointed the flashlights was of the living room window
673.86,679.65, from when i saw a face outside
681.51,687.09, a man standing outside the window with his thin nose barely touching the glass
687.96,689.82, his face was horrible
690.15,692.37, i couldn't look away
693.27,698.22, skin hung loosely on him making him look like an old man
698.37,701.52, long silver hair on his head
701.52,705.33, a few strands of which were dangling limply over that face
705.6,708.48, also huge bald patches
708.72,713.61, a part about the man was that he was smiling at me
713.97,716.46, a wide to the grand
716.7,720.6, desire to have black irises and white pupils
721.08,726.33, the bottom of the window i could see he was wearing a torn up with her
726.96,730.86, his smile hypnotize me
730.86,733.89, his eyes burned into my
734.22,736.83, it was no contemner all
737.43,741.45, even the thin cuts on the side of his face where an innkeeper
743.25,747.42, he was nearly completely unmoving
747.51,750.54, move in the slightest bit as he breathed
751.23,754.86, from the flashlight didn't seem to affect him at all
755.16,758.94, i moved close to the window and wrap my fist on the glad
759.18,762.12, the color is man only stared
762.72,767.4, the flashlight off and the man disappeared into the far
768.54,770.19, the light back on
770.49,772.41, he was visible again
773.55,775.32, was it
775.62,779.49, it was possible to see in the black fog with the flashlight
779.7,784.17, i was intrigued by the colonist man but also very frame
784.53,787.05, how long have been outside my window
787.62,792.27, harnack when i realized he could have been watching me sleep
793.29,798.33, i was on the place and less staring and ameile
799.2,805.35, much as i wanted to watch the news in the living room i instead found excuses to stay out
805.62,810.0, i found myself looking through the same pantry in my kitchen for almost half an hour
810.84,815.94, soon after i found myself sitting alone in a chair in my room upstairs
816.39,820.14, quietly thinking about when the folk would live
820.53,823.47, i couldn't stand of the living room for ever
823.8,826.59, i have renewed
827.46,832.5, first thing i did was flashed the light of the window to see if the careless man was still there
833.1,834.63, he was
834.96,839.7, didn't seem to have moved at all since i first realized he was there
840.33,844.92, settled i turned off the flashlight conserve the batteries
845.52,848.49, so i wouldn't have to look at him
848.76,854.31, myself comfortable on the couch and turned my attention to the news where adam was talking
855.66,859.44, thanks in the black forget that peter
859.74,869.82, he was saying because he forgot probably covering the old world by now stature comparison so
870.66,875.37, seems that i wasn't the only one who detected the presence of the things in the far
875.73,883.14, delivered report of mutilated bodies found in the streets with the eyes in their mouths and their teeth and their eye sockets
883.86,888.06, more of the new station survivors chimed in behind him with more information
888.57,894.6, strange thumps outside safe shutters where people were hold up
894.93,897.06, waiting for it to end
897.93,899.82, there was no denying it
899.91,902.94, something on natural was in the black hawk
903.36,907.26, maybe something beyond the colourless man outside my window
908.04,911.4, decided to sleep upstairs in my bedroom at night
911.49,918.33, on the flash light at the window before trudging up stairs to see if the colorless mannerless
919.5,921.3, he was still there
921.81,925.38, his eyes had moved for
926.01,929.67, once i'd gotten upstairs i placed the flashlight under my pillow
930.18,932.1, next to my bed
932.55,937.14, did something i hadn't done for a long long time
937.71,939.0, i
941.91,946.53, night i dream that the light had returned to the world
947.04,949.62, families walk down sidewalks
949.77,952.5, shouted to each other as they play
952.95,956.22, grass was a dark green and the sky burned blue
956.61,961.35, wind was chris gently pressing my cheek as it passed by
962.19,964.47, i looked around in wonder
965.1,967.77, the notice somebody standing behind me
968.97,974.64, well around to see the colorless man standing there with that same grimace
975.09,979.98, this time there was no glass separating us
980.85,985.59, i woke up sweating the first thing i saw was my bedroom window
986.01,989.85, curiosity i took the flashlight from under my pillow
989.88,992.25, pointed it at the window
992.61,996.57, the licking the switch on
997.95,1000.41, i don't know what i was expected to be there
1000.83,1006.44, probably thinking that the color is man would somehow be outside my second flower
1008.15,1010.1, something was out there
1010.67,1012.59, wasn't him
1013.64,1017.51, time it was a woman with pale skin and long black hair
1018.47,1022.97, she younger than the coleman probably in her twenties
1023.18,1031.13, i still have the same crooked grin the same vacant eyes and the same unsettling stair
1032.27,1035.54, she was also completely drained of color
1036.71,1042.08, i immediately fell on my bed and he screamed as the colourless woman stand on
1042.14,1046.52, to my feet and slam my bedroom door clothes
1046.58,1049.16, i hurried out and the whole
1050.0,1054.5, as soon as it shot i noted another window in the hallway
1055.28,1057.5, i flashed the light it
1057.92,1065.03, as when a fat colored man came into the line grinning as though laughing at a private joke
1066.32,1074.39, i didn't know what to do total panic sees me causing me to flee from the unseen eyes in the black for
1074.72,1077.99, in the flashlight of every window i came across
1078.47,1081.68, found another cowman in the guestroom window
1081.77,1088.31, a thin colorless man looking into the upstairs barber i managed to reach the stairs
1088.4,1095.93, i practically flew down them and dived into the kitchen where i ducked under the table and tried to catch my breath
1096.77,1101.03, the corner of my eye i could see the kitchen window
1101.87,1108.77, much as i didn't want to know what the was there i still flashed the light at the window
1109.52,1121.28, this was the worst one year he resembled a wolf with a wide not shaggy black thorn pointed ears
1121.61,1127.7, he stared at me with wide hungry pupilless white eyes
1128.24,1133.76, for crazy moments i thought it must have been a wolf coloma
1133.82,1141.2, then a thick dog to let out of his mouth and licked his chops as he continued to gaze
1143.09,1149.09, colorless person at every window in my house i realized
1150.26,1154.85, out of the kitchen to get away from the staring eyes of the colorless wall
1155.12,1157.88, found myself standing in the living room
1159.17,1167.15, flick the flash light on and i pointed it at the window to see that the collarless man was still there
1167.42,1169.19, patiently waiting
1170.63,1177.32, as i stared his grin widened and revealed fans like raises in the back of his mouth
1178.1,1180.74, his eyes flamed red
1181.1,1184.76, first color it since the black foedora
1185.57,1187.01, then
1187.31,1189.53, flashlight die
1189.83,1192.98, leaving me alone in the dark
1194.3,1198.89, as i stood there blinking in the art of blackness that surrounded me
1198.95,1201.71, pressed in from all sides
1202.52,1206.24, something began tapping on the living room window
1207.47,1213.65, as if in response the colour as people began tapping on every window in the house
1214.16,1216.41, sound was maddening
1217.04,1220.61, completely in unison and growing louder
1220.67,1224.99, more frequent as every second crept past
1226.49,1230.0, i've been listening to them ever since
1230.72,1231.77, the
1232.46,1235.19, tapping on the window
1236.12,1238.22, so never leaves
1238.49,1240.2, stop
1240.59,1243.02, never pauses
1243.83,1246.53, listening to that endless noise
1246.8,1251.54, i just know that it's tearing my mental state in 
1251.78,1254.84, how much longer i can take this
1257.24,1260.27, i just had a window break
