633.06,636.18, i think in trade i like that idea
637.32,709.74, especially when i moved to korea food was the easiest way of contact korean culture also it is an integral part of her life and have to ensure so it should be good i am mainmast one i'm from atlanta georgia and i lived in soul for tears i'm a farrier and i write for i reiterations i love riding i've always been a writer and i think just sharing it with people and i thought a lot of people tell me i went to the restaurant because he recommended it and it was great so even if we're not sharing the meal together it allows us to share a meal somehow surely experience were in date which is the neighborhood where i live and it's a pretty special neighbourhood because it's known for his not it's it's not a china town but there is a few blocks where there are chinese markets and really authentic good chinese boot
709.95,816.93, at first glance it looked like a regular neighborhood she dropped but for abaco the stalls offered some rare and hard to find ingredients i can find a lot of things that i can find and atypical korean marceline so untrue i like to come so unrelenting soul says are for those kinds of things this one is one of the more trains of the stalls here you can see all the anteucan smell it in the air and they also have things like these in cakes and dishes a pretty heavy right yes they really do they have these and they also have an see over there is here called thousand year old eggs and their basically route bury them under ground and kind of lesson to their finery pungent their very strong and i've tried it it's kind of an acquired taste comedie to change the way you cook definitely the way i cook is changed because the typical ingredients that you would use back home that i would use in georgia are so expensive here or difficult to find her in a asistente to cook that way in a sense to use what around you so this infantile this is one of the places where i buy my singin and they have different kinds of latimer even seen before emissaries
