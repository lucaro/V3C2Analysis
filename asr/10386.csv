0.3,6.99, part of being out on the land is just slowing down enough to really understand and appreciate where you came from
11.61,12.45, he
12.51,23.67, or operation family farm is a twenty five hundred acre farming operation and its blended farm between or chambers land and development dassie
23.7,44.34, establish the chamber side of it where i live now is actually on the developed my mom was family and it was homesteaded broke the latter in the early nineteen hundred nineteen o three nineteen o nine when you're born and raised somewhere and in that same place as where the homestead was it has a lot of value you know it has a lot of
44.37,53.7, a lot of chapters to where your family came and broke the ground and homesteaded i get that menon i just when every time i farm that piece of land
53.82,56.61, every time i finish a harvest and see the sight you think
56.64,60.27, over years of farmers have been doing this so it's pretty cool
60.27,64.8, the big transition here right now on our farm there's my wife martha 
64.83,92.76, a chase and we are a sort of a soul operation as far as you know i do get hired help that harvest this was the first year though that we actually took off a crop without my dad working with me so that was a big transition we work together last twenty five years and you know he's sort of earned his retirement and they retired into town off or the family farm and it was a very different earth way operated in knowing there
92.76,98.7, makes it more you know it makes it more of a challenge it's almost like when you're kind of like okay now here we go
99.0,125.22, my total shorter an you know i think you have a huge responsibility to understand the stories behind the land you know you really are the steward of these stories and the hard work that went in to break in the land and understanding you know the quarters of land and a man farming of funny business now not many understand any more because you have a story behind every quarter you know i think you otto the future generations to
125.25,152.1, convey those stories and i mean progressively farmings getting more technologically advanced there isn't the same types of hardship and stress but i think there's the same amount of stress is just a different type now slowing down enough to appreciate the stories in a society that's moving so quickly and that has such a short attention span for anything i think people generally in their lives just don't slow down enough to appreciate the little stories in their work day
152.1,179.22, i appreciate those you know the sun sets over the horizon of our farm and i was very trevanion's see farming in the same light i guess growing up that i do now i wanted to be in business belovedest and you know the thought of you now picking up your brief case and you know put on your suit and going to an office setting or being in some form of business important in that fashion always appealed to me
179.37,185.61, and now it took me till probably my second year university probably till i really started to understand
185.67,190.02, especially farming the direction it was going is big business
190.23,194.7, it's important business and it's multi faceted in the respect that
194.73,201.33, just because you're putting on a pair carhart doesn't make the value of your business acumen any different
202.44,265.65, i think farming is a really really challenging business from a mental and physical standpoint to stay healthy and you do have a lot more hours of sitting now it's not like our grandparents are great grandparents where we were shoveling grain and throwing balls and you doing all this we've got beautiful machines and cabs and do a lot of that physical work for us so you know we are spending more hours with less labor so i think it's important that farmers find ways to balance their health and find ways to be healthy the little the little things that they can do in their daily routine the end from a bigger aspect of mental health and then you know using our vehicle of food producers to help society understand their own food choices sosis never the same like it you have to learn and involve a change so rapidly that its being a farmer now is just it's just as constant learning curve i know that i'm not choosing to be the big farm i'm choosing to be the small efficient quality operation that has the ability to to monitor all my land by walking it
266.19,288.03, a modern day farmer it's a balance of you know not letting yourself go on out on the equipment and also you know growing in evolving all the time and i think farming itself with technologically and from a learning perspective is just so in depth in their so much massive amount of data that it's almost paralyzing but at the same time it still just as simple as it was
288.12,291.48, putting seeds in the ground praying that it rains
291.72,292.92, they grow
