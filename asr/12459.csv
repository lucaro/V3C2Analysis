147.96,152.28, again in his chelsea
153.6,160.68, normal circumstances i'd have him do this about eight times in him exhale rolled down
162.09,186.09, another challenge he can do put your both feet down as he's going to go ahead and bridge legs together now and he's going to have a single leg so inhaler exhale some down lengthen through the sides of the neck dominos held him up send tones away now he stays here a small and hale and as he exhales going to take his leg up up up and out

226.83,229.95, he's going to lift that leg all the way up
229.98,237.06, now he's going to lower the length best of his ability without losing height lower your leg
239.73,245.19, straight and go reach away without straight leg and come up
245.79,249.18, and put it down and roll
251.58,272.67, again we're going to try an take note maybe it's because of a tight it be the legs tend to gap open they use everything that they can to keep that suspension up his legs need to be in that railroad track they always need to be in line and try again give it with his like in heldensage saying business
274.05,276.78, lift up this leg
276.81,279.78, we reach away one
280.14,282.84, how we at
282.84,284.94, he put the foot down
286.2,287.82, and bring it home
288.57,292.65, i would have him do this about four times on each leg
293.07,302.28, floreat all right well let's try it on another another challenge in use the wall next okay all right let's do that
302.91,315.48, now is going to be doing part two of this exercise he has his feet placed equidistant from each other on the floor and he is not really at ninety degrees
315.69,338.28, because it's too difficult to bridge a case so he's going to in here exhales going to chemicals down length on the sides of his neck and he's going to curl up as he curls up he firmly presses his faint into the floor a very different work out than what he had before definitely more hands drinks inhalation
338.31,352.29, now how easily he can go up an get a good bridge in the eldest sat excelleth shoulders and cemented now take note right there he stops at a hundred and eighty degrees
352.32,355.65, is great and held a set exiled down
356.43,363.72, another thing that he has to think about is when he goes up in hell exhale and roll
363.93,369.06, want to check to see if both legs are in the train track
370.02,374.7, it is very important in held a sad exile rolled down
376.02,379.92, negative practice show how the legs get gay open
379.92,394.92, if they go out like that that's not right okay and you'll see some people do that just to get up and rolled down so as to one a time right and here we go exhale and roll and pick up and look for one eighty

421.02,426.36, roll on roll roll roll roll roll roll down
426.42,438.33, in here he doesn't have to roll he can just keep the neutral spine and just raise up in one motion in hell here exhale just lift without rolling perfect
438.6,447.84, down in one motion so he folds and unfolds he folded in hale as the exile he unfolds sending his knees
448.2,454.23, lovely option and down this is a great option for those who are have asepsis
