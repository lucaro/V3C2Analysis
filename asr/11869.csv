9.3,15.24, right now when people ask me what kind of the torchy i do
16.5,21.81, that alike the question what kind of music do you like it's
22.98,25.23, you can ask your soul
25.38,29.13, but it's a stupid question because it's just like
29.67,37.44, i think baby portraits the now it's like enough i don't i'm i'm all over the place and i always have been
37.8,44.37, i got several projects working on playing around with mediums has always been
44.49,52.32, something i been interested in trying to find a way to get a certain vision across at the moment i am working
52.35,54.96, last two or three years i've been working
55.17,59.46, developing a style with super
59.85,61.77, i felt
62.04,66.09, and what i like but i mean it you know
66.24,74.61, anywhere from twelve twelve to thirty two francs per second so i started working with it
75.6,79.8, for the stingy name is a sayin
79.92,81.57, a photographer
81.93,87.39, the boston area have been photographed for a bit over
88.08,90.72, six years 
90.9,93.54, four years seriously
94.2,98.34, i grew up on the east coast and philadelphia and
98.79,100.23, around and
100.23,105.39, batheaston area for about six years i would carry the supra
105.6,107.25, around with me
107.46,112.95, learned over time what kind of works on kind of does and i mean it would shoot standing still
113.58,114.51, now
114.99,122.85, what i thought was a good picture and all it was was a good picture over and over and over and over again kind of
123.78,127.17, rising or something and just terrill
127.56,130.92, mary into the viewer then i
131.01,135.87, you know thought more what the film was intended for to capture
136.32,140.4, spinach so i started
141.06,142.8, utilize like
143.28,145.74, the many frames repeating and shoot
145.77,147.03, a good
147.24,148.71, mary
149.13,154.89, one thing i noticed really alone with the two greatest how much happens in the second
155.52,166.32, for certain projects i shot four by five because it gives me
167.49,177.48, the process for certain projects calls for the for my five the slowing down that this camera demands
178.35,185.37, may image quality that a produces certain portraits all use the four by five but
185.49,195.54, it's not always necessary for that but correct of the abandoned house work i did and continued to do
198.09,201.18, i'm setting up the environment
201.33,203.31, my own story
204.9,207.42, can take an hour or so
207.48,210.63, in setting up the camera in just the right spot
211.02,215.04, attention to every corner of the frame
215.73,218.46, take my time is 
219.42,222.66, something that you just can't get out of a digital care
223.08,224.61, you can try to
224.79,228.45, treat the digital camera like a fort
229.47,234.87, you know for me it doesn't work like that i picked up a
235.08,237.48, at a summer
237.75,243.54, a type of thing at the art institute of philadelphia 
243.6,245.16, a class
245.73,247.77, there was polaroid
248.07,254.79, that's well as traditional saratoga phy in addition to painting and
255.15,258.6, drawing classes and such but
258.81,261.42, thirty five was 
261.48,265.14, my first letter and my first
266.19,269.7, my own poor camera and
270.57,271.8, much as i
272.46,280.29, drawn to the magic of the dark room purely grand the hold of me 
280.41,290.64, from there i was kind of bed comfort medium for matamora cheap little hole up
290.82,292.38, love
292.74,298.44, that for the same reason i loved palace of the
299.79,301.62, likely and
301.62,303.9, strange
304.02,307.62, effects that this cheap lasted and would have
308.16,312.6, i really drag me in a really grand and
312.69,313.95, because
315.9,318.15, being into painting
318.48,321.36, more so 
321.54,328.92, i had this soft kind of feel to it like men and
328.95,336.36, some happy mistakes would happen a defect of the camera or the film
336.99,337.95, very
338.31,341.91, you know it's not a turnspit certainly
342.63,345.75, you can nebulae the images to a certain extent
345.78,347.73, plain
347.76,349.71, destroy 
350.34,353.67, then the something else so there was a
358.74,361.14, i quality to me
361.59,363.3, warrior
363.81,364.74, as
365.31,367.98, so gotten a lot of attention
369.09,372.6, a particular and two pieces
373.11,376.95, so both of the piece that
377.19,389.34, i mean it just blew my mind that pay such a high for this work in creating but i mean when you with the pull it you get in the one and only
389.4,392.58, you can scan a polar but it's going to be a scanned with
393.24,402.21, you know and with a millimeter any kind of negative you can make a print and yes i will be like maybe than of a prim but with a pallid
402.78,404.55, one and all
404.64,408.12, to the malindore because actually i joined this
408.18,412.89, social and network for models and photographers
413.88,415.68, against my better
415.8,420.48, but i did it because i was just open trying to keep every
420.6,424.47, open because i needed to photograph and
425.16,429.54, this one model contacted me and 
430.65,433.11, really like her style and her look
433.77,436.02, she from new orleans
436.08,439.68, her name is nature has
440.34,451.41, i really like her style he loved to photograph her but i couldn't pay her and i told her this i said antecessor in some
451.86,453.69, i think
453.87,455.22, the time and
457.65,458.82, really couldn't
459.24,462.36, a pair but said i would love to photograph
464.1,468.39, i mean you're welcome to stay with me as a kind of a barter
470.55,476.28, back toward the forest and then she ended up spain with me for a couple days and
477.09,480.99, it was all new to me i mean i approached it just as i was taking a portrait
482.04,484.41, procter portrait just
485.31,493.11, this person would take their clothes off without any hang up there which was very exciting
493.35,494.43, but
495.51,501.36, so she came again later that summer the last summer
501.87,502.77, and
503.31,505.2, work some more and
505.29,509.25, then another model contacted me
510.18,513.18, she stayed with me and then
513.39,515.52, dry during the winter but
515.82,519.72, mother it's picking up again and its weird 
520.26,524.46, the first two models metaharta catlin the case
526.74,528.63, produced later
529.35,534.03, a really opened the door and she's my favorite model to work with
534.18,536.61, and will be working with her 
537.21,538.59, next week
539.52,545.46, one doesn't do like one i don't want to ever fall into a place where i'm doing work
546.18,547.62, a gallery
549.24,550.83, i mean i do
550.89,552.84, ography because i have to
553.29,555.48, and so busy and
556.47,559.2, no the have really that
559.8,564.63, venerable i mean maybe financially sometimes but
564.72,567.03, i've got a
567.81,570.6, always going to have a camera if i don't have a camera
570.93,572.55, going to be a picture
573.57,574.47, and
574.65,584.82, i had my camera and somehow a blow it it sucks blind and regret is one of the worst things about photography
585.0,587.97, feeling you can get from photography but
588.12,593.19, i had my camera and i was prepared but if i don't have my camera there's going to be an amazing picture
593.22,594.93, i was happy came
596.01,598.38, now my heart will
599.04,600.51, long to fill
