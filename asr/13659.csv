74.07,79.47, i forget the generical models of gender
79.53,83.58, attack to little
83.67,84.99, political in
85.65,89.61, i think it's sort of fundamental anywhere
89.76,91.11, and that is
92.58,94.53, a dozen allow
95.79,98.4, accession

133.23,134.64, relevant
136.2,137.34, take
137.34,140.31, important about his politics
142.38,147.06, regardless of the operating was a wordless
147.12,149.31, that there is a distinct
149.73,151.74, of generation
159.63,168.81, probably a better to say father would alistening to perform
169.59,176.34, the urchin people can be pressed as transpose
182.13,184.14, form of generation
189.81,194.79, i went to the war passed on to poison
194.88,198.51, the streets examples of things like transpire
199.44,201.96, you know assonance
202.23,204.72, ailesworth
205.83,209.55, the ground you can all these instances of transitory
210.54,217.17, oh you're really a man disguised as a toleration discussed man you get sexual bocage a soul
218.31,221.01, the discrimination of the work place
221.13,228.75, discrimination in school all these like clearing examples of oppression this on gender
229.08,231.99, no outward
232.08,234.9, women although some of the people who
234.9,246.72, thou who art a subject to transgression or face but so are some are white some are some men and some are something else altogether
247.53,249.81, it transmarine
250.26,253.32, pennington how many different ways
253.38,257.58, the subjects were different deity sedateness on
257.58,259.02, tender
259.59,261.0, he called
261.42,263.4, a transport
268.95,271.08, in all of it
271.5,275.46, all of it all enter all of his house to day with depression
276.0,277.71, i cannot see
278.01,282.21, there is a kind of other passions and fetish might be alien
283.47,286.71, he might be engaged in the passing of the people
286.89,289.71, distinct as with regard to gender
291.51,294.15, concern women or say
295.89,297.09, he
297.48,300.54, speak really concerns transfer
302.49,304.68, as
312.75,316.71, as a sea that everything is analysed in terms of this
317.55,320.88, and she falls prey to
322.53,325.92, all of the most egregious forms of
326.22,330.12, the mermaid
330.45,332.76, that's what you get some of the city
332.79,336.36, registration concealing from the natural attitude
336.45,340.68, he seemed all of the raviolis kind stop
340.89,345.39, flowing in part from his bill and counting
347.31,350.31, instances
351.72,364.35, but it also a lenient or paradox because the paradisiacal as beneficent is also very very concerning rightfully so violent that sexual arenias women
367.47,369.81, there
369.93,375.84, politics and he therefore patience about
376.38,381.12, about sexual ilegant women and male creditor
382.38,385.86, that's one aneroid
391.08,393.75, it
393.75,399.93, so i put you see with raymond or two different levels we see the lesser as paradise
401.28,405.15, in her but you also see his commitment to
405.39,409.08, i versified out onto oenomaus
414.57,415.83, what
417.27,426.15, footnote come she might be allowed to that
426.36,428.52, so
428.58,430.23, there
430.86,433.05, francis
433.5,435.45, more honest
435.45,438.69, the telescopic college under any
438.99,442.08, frinstance operation
442.23,448.47, i decided procuratores displace filiation
450.06,451.29, so
453.81,455.64, at that 
455.88,461.67, animating that is a sense that
462.78,465.63, men anybody saxons
469.05,471.39, there may be a place for
471.42,474.36, resisting that and trying to
474.69,479.7, see from the sexual yourself the agony caused by that
479.88,482.88, the part of woman's face is not how to deal with
483.63,493.47, i think further eniwetok about the ego centric sort of orlright and so a man who wanted to tramp
493.8,496.74, would be taking a really ego centric
496.89,502.44, vision of the world looking out for nebenaigoching tion make myself completely irrelevant
502.44,506.07, the struggle because of completely alienated my soul from
506.19,508.17, and massasoit
508.26,513.69, in addition to an acting as veronica women's roles
515.52,521.58, also do my bit to retain these walls by not staying staying male
521.67,525.93, fighting the system with the voice of authority and going up the voice for the third
526.59,528.69, at the system even more
528.9,534.66, i transliterated
534.87,538.2, i like having me privilege
538.23,542.43, the transition somatically
542.43,547.23, i enlisted handfasting up
548.76,551.91, that alone
551.94,557.88, the only gratification that
560.31,563.13, i uselessly
563.13,564.93, a woman comes
565.38,570.12, like all you like your moratorium
570.27,573.36, toleration
573.63,577.5, the difference that complaisance
577.68,581.13, in the silences to 
583.08,587.34, like a eneas is there not one the man
588.21,590.76, i i mean i saw i think that
591.66,600.12, this is an issue that antonio really sentiments point about like palace at something that he carries over and some of the oracles
600.72,603.24, attack
604.89,606.18, i want to 
606.24,608.19, things 
608.61,610.53, so i think that the point is right
610.56,618.45, amenothes i think that she would say for all the falling though however the sexual systems all about impression of women
620.04,624.27, what were concerned but there is no other kind of life to politics here
624.63,625.47, it
625.95,628.14, may be heard by this system
629.52,633.54, there may be a space for them to deal with it right and it may be a sunday
633.63,636.75, their politics and better not be
637.8,641.4, sort of like the women who were like you know so
641.46,644.13, i should be too like you know
644.22,647.97, on the antoine of male amended
648.24,652.77, i not sure the responsibilities right ritterstein
654.6,660.21, nor is the vision still feint a single act of right
663.93,669.45, you need to do you need teaches you need the other half is to be able to say
670.32,674.46, you know actually ramon when you call this person
676.92,681.75, all his person about when you call this person a few miles
682.53,683.73, women
684.51,685.86, all
686.1,688.62, in one procession self
688.95,692.28, and in the form of antonia
692.7,696.45, engaged in something you have privilege
696.48,699.09, you actually doing something
699.42,701.52, her ultimate people
701.64,702.93, see this
702.99,706.41, i visit out without that to be visible
708.18,710.73, that's not visible than
718.59,719.76, so
719.76,721.29, obviously
721.62,726.45, failure soothing as accost important about stones article
726.9,729.99, no specific theory of jugurtha startled
730.74,731.67, but
731.85,738.45, clearly to the idea that there is something else going on
738.99,742.41, late terrasson resistance
743.16,745.08, his progeny
745.23,748.29, and which were not taught about the prussian
750.45,751.77, in else
754.35,757.38, the key moved and where the very looks like
759.03,760.86, because men
761.16,770.37, don't see this she sleep in to commit all sorts of egregious camford attitude propped up by her own paradigm
772.56,774.93, the two sort of these
775.47,777.48, criticisms are ready
778.23,784.02, which is her recreations of chapel appointed these women there presentations of chancel
784.23,792.06, further the prosaically tripped in the allow no room for the lives objectional trans people
793.62,794.97, don't

805.23,808.11, no matter what you do is a person can't win
809.73,814.68, the way they are playing out in the way which bananaland down the double lines
815.28,822.27, i became so like to step back and look at them hesitate
822.96,826.08, one and now getting into this issue of
826.35,827.91, age
830.79,832.68, you have
832.8,836.88, one sort of malevolence
852.27,857.88, one hand irritation the medical
858.03,862.59, you come out habitations
867.96,869.97, to insure
870.51,873.6, now as you read the chapter you looked up
873.72,875.07, the 
876.24,882.75, the lesbians you know identify commonest transome
891.9,899.88, the one who wants to be however the chancel constricted lesbian feminines woman's sexual spiritual
900.51,913.02, although it usually temporised by deception to talk to one thanatomania that
913.29,917.7, if the chance actually constructed the feminist
917.76,927.51, he is able to gain attestation woman's face because it menatonon estancia and just as not happened to mention it
928.65,932.04, this issue of deception
932.04,933.36, i
933.36,941.16, controlling the question of the saltonstalls raised in the contact of how fatal

981.09,982.89, his problem of course
984.51,988.8, of the double and the way you know 
988.92,993.27, i noticed noticed periodic here
993.27,996.42, this is a back to your point she is a sense
997.11,1001.88, this person himself accountable for
1003.86,1007.07, section ten
1007.34,1015.5, the medardus which may part require that deception as to access to surfaces
1017.81,1020.75, why she does of such conversions
1023.9,1026.36, i mean actually kind of weird it's 
1026.57,1028.82, eaverson

1079.4,1080.6, a minute
1080.72,1083.03, now he was to listen to me more
1083.81,1087.35, everyone is always coming emancipation
1088.88,1090.62, what happened saying
1090.65,1092.9, this is how have
1093.05,1109.91, in the meeting conversion experience all welcome the rowboat and isn't this kind of conversion experience precisely part of what rainspout is a part of the idea like consciousness raising

1147.17,1149.69, before exposure
1150.14,1152.6, only between planes
1152.6,1154.67, madelinette 
1155.27,1157.64, quite so she still not
1160.49,1161.48, said
1161.6,1163.79, it is right
1168.2,1177.71, yes assumes conversion experiences would have been if it really is such a male omniscient and
1177.77,1178.64, he
1179.36,1187.88, i see that obvious and making their conversion imagination into
1188.33,1190.49, as you know a woman
1190.85,1193.76, see you not once the point the split i mean if
1193.91,1195.26, i
1195.41,1197.78, time
1199.46,1200.57, i
1200.6,1202.22, with
1202.58,1209.33, my baccalaureate painting only for this is upon
1209.93,1211.52, and to ask

1214.76,1219.89, in this contact understands to retranslation because at this point transition
1220.01,1222.65, aramis made in
1224.06,1228.02, she suggested it outer
1228.47,1240.02, you might see some different views from herself dragonetti prison would be stateliness she
1240.17,1244.52, milichus henhouse seems to
1245.0,1257.84, about you know the importance of promises cariatides whitby potation that's not all this goes on the granados reassurance for her a fact the experiences
1258.23,1260.66, an interval exacts
1261.02,1264.74, the disinterested has in society
1265.16,1269.96, that you're going to have a particular ciprien as a person who has access
1270.2,1274.7, a person who is a wife is not in have and this is going to shake you
1275.06,1277.34, so that is
1277.76,1280.4, this is my experience upbringing
1280.4,1283.79, matter is that some one who was
1285.53,1290.54, why and raised as a man is not going to have
1290.69,1293.3, the same kind of history of oppression
1296.42,1298.76, individual
1301.04,1305.06, necessarily have the same acquaintance
1305.45,1307.91, with social batangas women
1308.57,1313.04, come constitute ticular privileges that
1313.16,1316.07, not as a custom to
1317.24,1319.01, to be taken for granted
1319.22,1321.14, this one of
1321.47,1333.77, actually it sort of like religion it not just just romanists the experience anaesthesia because
1334.31,1339.77, this is important said and i think that when we talk about the idea of privilege
1340.34,1341.93, really afflicted
1342.23,1343.31, as
1343.79,1345.53, the vision
1345.53,1347.21, i
1348.35,1350.03, a jontleman
1350.66,1353.15, business men encased to
1353.21,1354.71, all these privileges
1354.83,1356.33, i 
1356.9,1361.37, no woman hotel these lines richelieu stereotypes
1361.97,1366.98, ring around you know have alistening to

1375.92,1385.61, attraction very young so transition very old some inexperienced with free example sex for over early on the experience with sexual violence
1385.67,1391.82, early i mean the pans on the but at some point you're going to have a large chunk of your life
1391.85,1396.08, living in his specific old and which pointing
1397.49,1399.44, sort of vantage point
1399.62,1404.57, as i domination would have had our wise
1405.23,1407.39, seeing that
1407.63,1411.74, kind of dropout of this picture for some reason we always sort of end up with
1411.98,1415.49, just a picture of someone who magically transitions
1415.64,1420.95, he has no contenting 
1424.73,1427.16, another issue on
1428.84,1431.87, has been about the living
1435.59,1441.74, again comes from this problem of the second access or dimension of gender dropping out
1441.86,1444.53, only thinking in terms of
1446.51,1448.73, general passion of women
1449.51,1451.58, because this person
1452.24,1453.86, hence
1455.21,1458.69, as a girl from very
1458.78,1461.63, penroof generous
1463.22,1465.95, what i experience a form of
1466.07,1467.81, oppression
1470.06,1476.66, mary honeywood to that supposed to do that
1476.78,1478.31, in 
1480.62,1484.4, i disappearance related to chance of passion
1485.3,1486.89, the picture
1495.41,1498.29, the unsound a little bit
1500.63,1502.49, some day give him
1502.67,1512.69, delaven complicated baseness i mean when he wanders you know that gender oppression in an itself is it out for mental
1513.11,1515.57, now you know me
1516.02,1522.77, i similarities
1527.93,1533.09, you know being leisurely bread wine or the masculine
1534.29,1543.02, sincerity don't have the tionnontates kanonsionni
1543.74,1548.81, orientations
1548.9,1555.95, i alienation 
1556.04,1558.29, a race
1558.41,1560.24, silence
1560.36,1563.66, roman
1565.67,1568.64, so you have the particular cast of
1568.82,1570.14, being a man
1571.25,1573.47, for that noise
1574.52,1576.02, it
1576.83,1580.43, place where save that marcos
1582.05,1583.19, say
1583.22,1589.01, and i think that you know oppress for that are partly look at it
1589.25,1593.99, examination

1613.43,1616.55, latent
1616.64,1618.71, as
1620.93,1627.53, i think that's what ramsay drawing to the week away she had sandemanians
1627.77,1629.33, to be
1629.36,1632.69, you are suffering the sexual system
1632.75,1636.08, no
1636.71,1640.49, she is in a countenance that but she
1640.58,1646.13, also gisebert of the sexual system which many which mainly presses women the women
1646.52,1649.16, one thirty to make is actually different
1649.28,1650.54, actually
1651.92,1654.8, a different dimension of passion
1656.06,1659.21, this man was in which we see
1659.3,1661.43, people subject to
1662.78,1664.31, it
1670.16,1672.62, i think that there's also a
1674.0,1677.51, very deep sort of psychic pain and resentment
1677.63,1680.72, that man has come in from in which
1681.89,1684.23, if she was to allow the 
1684.23,1688.73, she hasn't put i would think that if she was to allow the chapel perhaps
1689.36,1691.19, do suffer
1691.64,1695.42, they had some gender stereotypes right into little
1695.69,1697.07, boys
1697.07,1702.62, are two feminine obviously get to dominate entranced i think that
1702.65,1705.29, the place that she's coming from would be like
1706.13,1733.49, may be true but if they weren't seen is so valuable in society there wouldn't be such high expectations for them my girls compensate the want you know to a certain point because there really expendable anyway as long as they get it together become marriage material at some point it's okay boys from variety and have very high expectations put on them the seas more valuable to get a plan worthy gaolor more they get to test the boundaries more they get more relief when they get more everything so
1733.88,1738.77, somebody comes into for example one's face or her concern of life the
1739.1,1740.18, disguise
1740.48,1742.22, he separates right
1745.52,1748.58, she might feel like she's been duped into
1749.24,1753.62, respecting a person whom she wouldn't you know what i mean like 
1753.65,1755.72, into that your valuable
1756.08,1760.49, being duped into thinking that because maybe this person
1761.03,1772.31, is this sort of intelectual communicate in ways that some other woman can't right on this person is highly educated and had access to certain things other people didn't write a tentorial sort of like
1772.37,1777.14, you really a boy well just figure you know there's a sort of like
1778.67,1782.69, a race i think that she's coming from an obviously
1782.84,1788.9, from the house to do with that kind of privilege not the kind of privilege rainforth winterman
1788.99,1792.17, kind of privilege from the day of his fricassee is valuable
1793.4,1798.44, also that she does recognise when she does ionize
1799.67,1805.1, suffering in a miladi dual suffering under a icefloes recognise that
1805.55,1815.0, that he doesn't recognize that this is what i was saying what sort of life you know that they alter perspective is she allowed for an actual other dimension of oppression of resistance
1818.3,1820.67, she did i don't think she would care
1821.39,1822.35, in
1824.87,1826.43, i have 
1828.95,1834.14, what a after
1835.82,1848.06, his is a stream into one to make sitooation with regard to all the two tenacity
1848.33,1850.04, for
1850.34,1851.69, i think that
1853.07,1857.12, the words as i said before is sort of like lecturing
1857.45,1858.98, i do
1861.29,1864.95, you know a lot of people are either in appetising
1866.12,1869.93, erasistratus
1870.41,1875.36, but it's also another interesting point i think is this focus on
1876.62,1879.53, tarascon
1880.49,1883.46, assentation is constant now
1883.85,1886.22, as a little bit remarkable
1891.29,1894.89, in a little bit as eveena little bit differently
1895.85,1898.64, the reason it may be a little bit differently
1902.36,1908.36, prentices of bring to master under presentation
1909.11,1913.7, and may not exactly rotate in the way we not actually so
1913.7,1918.02, because she was not raised to be nottoway because she wasn't
1918.65,1922.31, and you know she was born
1922.34,1928.85, particular being a itinerant in particular the way is not marianne a little of
1930.32,1935.72, as you forgot of cithaeron and
1936.98,1939.14, this attempt at
1940.82,1948.02, she and of asnieres on that because his reading
1948.92,1959.18, there associates it it seems as that denounced centinela to what
1959.36,1966.71, like what i went through when i went through puberty and i was learning how to live into the role of more adult
1966.89,1969.95, and i mean it's awkward all round
1970.19,1974.03, i see that it would be terrorised mother to
1974.81,1977.18, i
1977.63,1983.72, i idolater i don't have the time to improve it is more
1985.4,1992.96, because in general i don't want to be a revelation based on my arab i mean journalism it would
1993.14,1995.18, perhaps later than
1995.72,2001.99, you know learning got to be a woman is problematical and it indelicate
2002.11,2011.5, you know immediately
2011.59,2018.16, when in identical because you learned generation way is colored may be differently
2018.25,2020.5, reading differently may
2020.59,2023.05, this done paper
2023.08,2024.04, i mean
2026.86,2030.61, because the way that she's wearing tendresses a little bit and
2033.64,2037.57, and so in beastlinesses
2039.82,2045.58, you know she's trying to issue these monasteries benilo reading funny
2045.76,2048.34, that is like to man
2048.37,2053.8, really it's just like you know reading one of encountering
2055.75,2061.12, now with the amenities about the idol
2061.45,2068.11, article one kind of way behind watching
2068.26,2080.89, what sort of notion i some points on making her because there are other problems it levinstein model
