0.0,8.58, anna
11.91,19.17, to to to to day looking at titehugge twice this is the plug in
19.35,23.46, a full point five four final cut crow
23.55,31.71, i would probably recommend using to externate effects it a little bit easier to do keep framing than working with it
32.1,37.23, in final cut most of my students of being using twixt
37.53,46.83, in final cut in just going to hold a clerk is tutorial on how to get it to work in tiahuanaco
48.99,58.2, what we need to do is first we've got on with it here so when his connoisseur amenothes
58.26,60.99, if the tulisanes
62.37,65.01, esther
65.13,67.89, it took the effect
68.64,71.13, i was shown a continent
72.03,80.79, and it was still a frame of second so what we need to do is being and first we want to change the original fated
80.97,84.9, wolfram to alterin of first
85.14,86.43, a
87.12,90.06, so it was low down the contempt
90.18,99.21, from france to your friends so let's go to on that line move into cinema all this is where we can do it so continued
101.31,106.56, the database so we can cancel so we can go far open cliff
107.79,112.14, the isolated one by one here that i belie
114.6,124.23, we're going to conform this from fifteen nine fort twenty four i mean i is in plenty for me to cause thirtyseven twenty five except on decision for
124.98,126.78, as
127.5,133.98, it conform now before you hit them for i would recommend the back of your original sosie
133.98,139.11, the older i already done this mine is over here we can see the three father
139.8,145.56, come and then we go that mountain from fifty nine point nine four
148.11,151.62, more from the muse this cliff but let's conform anyway
153.21,156.51, and the next one said final and is the back
156.72,162.9, so in less conform and control and here we go as a treeless now conformed
167.04,176.37, the frames will is not a notoriety for solidity and allopathists six seconds we can see her the duration of six seconds
176.91,179.88, the duration of the cliff here
179.94,180.87, i
181.02,187.56, concentration formed it is slightly more than double
188.04,190.77, duration solicitors
190.98,195.12, and we entertained
195.33,196.77, this
197.46,200.28, they want their import upon
200.37,202.56, open
202.77,209.16, the panic is fine saineanu
209.19,216.63, i want to find the actual we're going to work with proclamations go from about her
216.63,219.96, in this case i'm going to make a point in my time in
220.02,221.82, but 
222.12,228.42, and that's got to bother using the and peter so this is my kind of
228.45,230.64, extreme simmerton point
230.7,231.99, i work with
233.52,235.8, i need to do in final kids
235.8,238.11, i complicated one thing that
238.8,241.23, little bit different to how you can do nought
242.49,245.67, take a copy of this to command a
245.91,249.45, to my brows and at command and
249.66,253.86, in slow motion 
253.86,254.82, ah
255.72,264.21, at present bring new sequence was imminent now war is really important is because we're going to make a kind of nest
265.74,267.51, we need to match
267.84,271.5, two sequences so there's all original sequence
271.86,280.08, is a man rochecliffe sir go slow motion supine and the easiest way to initiation in
281.07,282.63, same colt
282.99,284.82, the sequence
285.75,290.28, should now that you can delineate
290.31,292.5, so then now matching
292.77,295.5, it is we're going to taste
295.59,304.29, be content that i esoterical sequence into artemion nest sequence
304.41,306.48, this is probably enough
307.5,311.25, a second is a you know doesn't have to do any more
312.45,314.07, then the
314.61,316.5, original sequence
316.74,321.69, original sequence so we can believe this section as we want to get rid of his
323.22,328.08, and i take a messerschmitt is this is acquant
328.59,331.08, in serious
331.5,340.68, wataitee one's going to say render the audio let's just render that very quickly is it positions are grand
340.89,342.48, put down
342.57,345.51, the look about five seconds
347.25,348.75, like that
348.96,354.78, and only we will need to them a mental
354.9,357.54, i actually on the pelican
361.14,363.93, this is a slow motion
364.29,369.45, needless so now we can go ahead and select this
370.05,373.89, to fix and videttes
374.4,379.35, raimundo for point five tossing in of
379.65,387.27, the boy and he comes up as rendering we need to render that laurentine anything now if i doubled like
387.57,388.59, let
388.68,389.82, sequence
389.85,392.58, to take me back to my secret
393.3,400.59, the easiest way and on that the way would i work with the filter is just that return he on the keen
401.28,403.26, into our view
403.35,405.96, we can see to
406.71,409.02, affection
409.56,414.12, there's a silesian going to touch it to
414.96,417.36, of these there
417.57,426.45, actors best without really worry about this we could put that on if we want that i don't bother mosenstein is fine
426.69,428.49, speed is fine
429.09,435.3, no work with a come back to her a frame interpretation now because we've got some notion
435.57,436.95, in this
437.04,438.36, we can see that
438.51,440.7, then the temoins
440.85,446.46, emotion was of lemonade and we incline smart blow
446.67,448.53, it works with
448.77,451.89, sections of the feet and the chair
452.97,455.88, lend them nicely together
456.36,458.58, lemonade
459.78,463.23, see depends on what speedometer
463.26,467.73, to select and i'm going to work from twenty five
470.04,471.63, i am
472.02,473.82, i need to render
474.0,478.62, render this and then we will come back once we are rendered
479.94,482.55, so we have rendered out
483.0,489.39, i moved a few things around after i finished the render and i actually i extended this
489.93,496.41, it cause it was about here i think originated it out a little bit so i a bit more when effect
497.07,500.34, next thing is erotion the end there's a ending
500.7,503.1, it is take a quick look at that
503.31,509.1, to see a lotion in fact looked pearly do very nice there we go
509.16,512.28, five percent this is working at
512.76,515.88, it was originally the hundred percent of his saw
516.75,520.65, being from this is now gone on
520.77,523.71, per cent of twenty four francs
525.39,528.96, and so i think this is quite nice
529.41,538.41, gaetano motion has no blowing in the pretty good i am very happy with
538.5,540.69, it looks a nice
542.22,545.46, being only an arm
546.3,552.27, areas around the feet or the movement of the chair which sometimes you can get with 
552.54,554.88, too much motion down
555.09,561.81, i think i liked radice and ledges that we go so we basically look at
561.84,564.51, sing to extend final cut
564.57,572.13, i would recommend trying to use an offer affects keep framing is a little bit easier than having to nest in
573.09,576.75, the elements that you have to do a final cut to get
578.79,585.36, if you have got information of this is how you can put it together and it works it nicely
585.63,590.01, again this was shot on the cannon seventy sixty frames
590.28,594.6, we conformed in cinema all down twenty four follerin
594.66,598.71, made a little added and then added a quick
598.86,605.34, and they go so if you're only questions please till freedom ratify want any other sort susarion then
605.37,607.14, she
607.62,610.08, i will come back at some other time with
610.38,613.77, coloring to trill be next
614.25,616.29, maybe even to or something like that
617.61,620.04, into this one and next
620.28,629.58, the captain
