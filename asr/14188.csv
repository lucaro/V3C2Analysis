0.06,72.93, my name is coercion on campus faster and i got to spend entire summer in san diego with those crazy and so the weirdness of the story is as you watch that video now closing their minds on the beach and parathyroids i don't know if that's like seriousness and it's good to be back in oversophisticated
73.08,77.82, this is a little weird but on my favorite places the counter just get away
78.03,131.49, slow down take a deep breath and just reflect is actually loved going to the pomander and sounds like it a little bit morbid but here's why there's no one out there and so is like the one quiet place in penter's some actually really encouraging and there's some intricate in the midst of a bunch of kindliness
132.06,198.09, i just never want that to be said of my life that at the age of becoming apathetic become a disinfecting it on cruise control to get a job and just kind of work then on the five and just kind of like costume just waiting to be put into the grave at everything i mean to astonishment and there's a lot of things that are written on the tombstones and a lot of the were faultless not the day they were born they can control that none control that and it's not the day that you die at no one can control that the most important part of the tombstone is the dash in the middle
198.48,201.54, life that was lived 
201.78,218.97, i think about like would it what is it that i want to be written i'm on my tenant to get really i know a very introspective and migrating a very vulnerable places in my life and i pologize going really deeply quick but i'm going somewhere to discreetest men keep growing me
220.41,230.19, i think about what it is that i want to be written about me and i know that hopefully you thought about this as well what is it that you want to be written about you
230.19,240.09, and i want it i would love for to say something about being in a very loving husband and i love my wife very well and i one day like i'm going to love my kids and be great father
240.96,244.23, this morning i began to think bigger than that
244.77,277.44, those are great things and pray for those things that hope for all of that for all of us but i think there's a bigger threshing that littered qualify that should he die chuchu three things that men would pay that for us as resonators that would mark us and when i say resonate church i want to be really careful because what i don't mean as i don't just mean the organization the big church
278.46,285.0, i'm praying that these things would mark each and every one of us in this room
285.72,289.2, his followers of jesus we are the church
289.26,301.38, so these are the things that i have been as i've been looking at the text and dreaming and praying and going god what is it that you just kind of place on my heart to i want us to look at some scripture just a moment
301.71,331.32, i see there are three things that i think should define each and every one of us as the church each and every one of us if we confess that jesus christ is our lord the three things that should it so define all of us is alone a prey for really quick as i think this could get really crazy really quick and i and i don't want to be up here on my own i need the spirit to speak for me and open a heart so cambray for us and i will dive into the text
332.76,333.96, he
333.99,336.63, to night
338.94,344.16, i think it very easy for me to step on the stage and
344.61,355.17, just try to be witty and just having fun or clever or to be a really good teacher is an lay it like scale it all on the core but father 
356.22,357.81, that's not what we need
359.25,368.34, we have shown in this room we have gathered here not to hear from drew but to hear from you
369.0,375.24, o jesus we and i mean i mean need you right now to just kind of and speak on behalf of me
375.81,383.16, anything is about to come out of my mouth that doesn't line up with your heart and got out prattleton
383.19,384.48, the moments
385.29,405.6, pray for each person as to myself included would you would you open our hearts would you give us an eyes to see and ears to hear what it is that you have force to night father as it would come in this room and we just sang some songs and we just were entertained by a sermon but we we don't meet with you then father we
405.87,407.13, missed it
408.51,411.48, you would you speak
411.72,415.11, listening and in your name i pray
415.23,526.98, if you have a bible my love free to grab it and now with the good turn with me to act chapter four wait upon the screen a hackett the new testament and you've got a matthew mark blue john the four gospels since the diaries written about the life of this man named jesus and it switches and it goes into the book of acts is here will be to night which is just an the story of the early church and so up to this point the four gospels we see that man jesus shows up on the scene does some crazy stuff man is as his healing people is bringing dead people to life and they crucify that he willingly lay down his life on a cross to take all of our sin our punishment into the rattlers jesus on our behalf a sacrifice on our behalf and he is placed into a tomb three days later raises from the grave walk some planters from the forty days hanging out with his close by and the beginning of a clandestine and that power is going to propel you on mission and so you're going to be my witness as you're going to carry the story to your neighborhood to the surrounding neighbourhood to the people you don't like and then ultimately to the ends of the earth and that's in chapter one and chapter two we see that the church gathers together the holy spirit shows up shows off some crazy stuff happens and then all of a sudden meant people get targeting added to the family i mean massive numbers of thousands of people are being membrane family of god
527.4,556.41, and ourselves in the story peter and john these two disciples two guys that it walked with cheeses really close and knew him really really well on their way to the temple to worship and on their way to the temple they come up to this beggar that at the tenuitatem at a good place if you are a beggar and your lame and you need some money kind of tug on the religious heart strings of people go into worshipfully bad if he don't give you money before they pray and so that's a good that's a good place to be and so he's begging for money
556.41,564.33, he's lame he's been these but forty years old he seeing on the side and peter and john always sudden hear him they stopped they turned to him
564.33,566.58, and they look a guy listen
567.06,568.8, we got it
569.7,616.29, we do have we give freely and the name of jesus christ get up and walk and this man it's never been walk all of a sudden and the muscles in his legs begin to just kind of a line at the hall a sudden the bones and of matrons and he gets to stand up and always he standing up he goes on dancing and screaming and singing and making a really big commotion in the temple the scow was well known people would have seen him outside begging for money and so this big rocks is happening in all the sudden men theaters the saints
616.5,629.52, so all they can think of is to take peter and john and throw him in prison could i kind of like the day and they go well just handle this to morrow and that's where we find ourselves in the story the beginning of a chapter four
629.73,631.5, chapter 
631.56,632.94, first one
633.3,634.62, says this
636.54,639.96, as they were speaking to the people talking about peter and john
640.35,645.09, priests and the captain of the temple and the sad to see came upon some big wigs
645.63,663.06, to greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming and jesus the red direction from the dead to side not sadducees did not believe in the resurrection thought it was blossoming more than likely these men were standing in the trial watching jesus be put on trial
663.18,680.01, so that not a big fan of the resurrection verdure so they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day for was already evening but many of those who had heard the word believed and the number of men came to about five thousand crazy the big church fashous
680.34,694.26, on the next day the rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in jerusalem with annie the high priests and caiaphas and john alexander and all who were of the high priestly family for seven
694.59,701.64, when they had set them in the midst they inquired by what power about what name did you do this
701.91,703.26, i love this
703.5,704.79, peter
704.82,707.88, filled with the holy spirit said to them
708.12,755.01, of the people and elders if we are being examined to day concerning a good deed done to a crippled man by what means this man has been healed then let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom the biting words whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead by him this man is standing before you well this jesus is the one that was rejected by you the builders which is become the cornerstone and an inverse twelve is his key and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved
756.12,757.38, first thing
757.71,759.42, that i believe
759.54,767.28, you and i as followers of jesus the one thing that should identify us one thing it should just bismark us is this
767.79,791.1, that a message should be clear we see an attack it for peter and john the message was clear and i pray for you and i that our message is clear that when peter and john get pressed and they said he listen i how are you able to do this by what power you put a heitman temper full of the holy spirit and does not shy away
791.88,803.82, i merely begins to go into the gospel and the essentially he shares the entire story to ianthe truth of the gospel or message as a church our message as a believer is in this
804.45,810.81, the god created the entire world that he spoke it into existence
811.29,827.34, he took it and he formed man briefly and to man so that we would have this opportunity to have a deep and summit relationship with the god of the viewers walk with him now him be known by him we may get three chapters into the book before we totally screw it all up
827.97,835.89, and that moment when we spit in the face of god go listen got i think i've got a better plan than you do i can do this on my own
836.49,841.26, in that moment and enters the world and fractures it as we know it
841.26,852.75, and each and every one of us and we feel the effects of that even in the twenty first century the note watch the news very long before you realise he listened we live in a pretty mess up world
852.9,878.1, you don't have to hang out with two year olds very long before you realize the broken sinful evil creatures okay it's just truth okay from the parents in the room got a man okar's a deal like no one teaches a two year old to be evil or to be sent forward be selfish or to steal or to say mind or to bite those things are in us but in us
878.76,891.6, the reason is this from the moment that senate world in frasilah sent plagues us it is an it's a cancer that is passed down from father to son mother to daughter in his in each and every one of us
891.99,895.26, separated us from a holy god
895.38,898.14, have nothing to do with that treason
898.38,900.45, nothing to do with that sin
900.63,933.96, and all the old testament although it's a bunch of really cool small stories when some very interesting it's really just one giant promise and the promise is this that one day that i see the world as it is i see it that it's broken but one day i'm going to send a hero to fix this one mameena hero to a fix all that is broken and so we moved from the old testament into the new testament matthew mark luganese this that the god of the universe himself leaves his throne room
934.56,936.12, comes to earth
936.24,938.85, wrap himself in human flesh
939.42,941.4, call him cheeses
942.0,946.77, even a man well meaning god is with us
947.58,958.59, he lived on this earth perfectly for thirty three years of teaching us what it means to be fully human then you willingly lay his life down on the cross to pay for that sent
959.49,961.68, paid for arm stakes
961.8,963.21, a perfect
963.39,965.07, he didn't deserve that
966.33,970.86, to realize that the only way to fix this was translators
971.88,997.02, into a tomb through days later rose from the grave proving that he has the power over sin and death and for any one that would push and i listen jesus and that would confess with their mouth that jesus warble in the heart that he is who he says he is and you and i can be completely forgiven and be become a new creation with scripture that we would go from being enemies of god
997.92,1031.22, be now adopted sons and daughters of jesus christ of women of the god of the universe that crazy talk and that's what peter and john just said and so everyone around us begins to go either one or two things that we want to kill these guys or he had it be part of that i'll join the family and so it was very divisive but that was their message very very clear i remember going up in the south like i'm from east texas and you're going to hear some accents going to pop out i apologize 
1031.76,1057.17, but in the south we have what i believe to be the greatest vigorous fast food chain i don't know this is that for debate i just got say is the great and the place is called chickamauga first time life changing okay but here's the tea for those of you that are
1057.17,1091.7, raise the northwest and you don't quite know what i'm talking about the whole thing is like hay we didn't like invention just the chicken sandwich and let me out it is incredible okay now they've had a bunch of other incredible things they've got like the awful festubert much prefatory okay there's i mean they've got these like dream comes that are incredible takes arbela have got like different sauces and all of them are some okay and here the deal
1092.27,1115.67, somehow as a marketing boy they have hired these two renegade tales that seemed to find their way on billboards across the south kind of analyzing them and for covent
1115.73,1125.63, where you find yourself and about how you feel about chickless for any one that's been around that company is very very clear
1125.63,1134.36, it's just three simple words that these cows promote like crazy and the cibots eat more
1134.36,1135.26, chicken
1135.56,1141.56, that's it that's their message to willie awesome the
1141.65,1149.3, one incredible sweet tea but the quest but the message
1149.48,1151.19, eat more chicken
1151.64,1153.38, unbelievably clear
1153.89,1155.54, unbelievably clear
1156.5,1158.33, for you and i
1159.59,1162.56, find ourselves in a world
1162.83,1165.47, is begging for answers
1167.0,1170.18, tom where you and i find ourselves stuttering
1171.23,1176.9, not really sure i don't really know what the message is what it is that we believe and we found ourselves stuttering
1177.89,1181.88, for us his followers are message needs to be really clear
1183.8,1189.11, all of the religions say that you've got to march away up the mountain to get as close as you can to god
1189.95,1208.49, john says this is an there's not the salvation no other name because you can't make your way up to the top of the mountain the difference between christianity and all of the world religions that says this in a matter how hard you try you fail every single time you will never get to the top of the mountain
1208.49,1213.26, but praise be to god that he left that peak
1213.32,1215.9, came down to us to rescue us
1217.19,1221.57, christianity is not that a god came to make bad people good people
1221.84,1223.43, we get that
1224.42,1225.8, gospel
1225.98,1228.98, that jesus came to make dead people
1231.26,1232.49, the gospel
1233.36,1235.76, a message be really clear
1237.2,1238.46, and me to
1238.64,1246.23, some one message clear number two quality that hope that for us as a church for every one of us is a believer
1246.83,1250.67, be marked by christ the message is clear
1251.6,1254.33, they would be marked by cries first thirteen
1254.39,1258.74, now and they saw the boldness of peter and john
1258.92,1293.36, and perceived that they were uneducated common men so he's got me fishermen like they did were educated they weren't far seas they weren't really super religious guys that knew all of the scripture the just uneducated guy if you if any of the guys are dynasty and you've got uncle side he says there's two types of people there's educated and there's uneducated okay peter john uneducated okay to say listen we saw the boldness of peter and john perceived they were uneducated common men and they were astonished and they recognized that they had been with jesus
1293.72,1301.07, seeing the man who was healed standing beside them they had nothing to say in opposition
1301.1,1303.77, when they commanded them to leave the council
1304.19,1317.03, i conferred with one another saying what shall we do with these men for that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of jerusalem and we can not
1317.12,1318.14, it
1320.45,1321.74, john
1322.82,1323.93, and i
1324.62,1326.57, should be marked by christ
1327.41,1333.41, look at these men and go there is absolutely nothing special about these guys
1334.1,1342.59, nothing sparkle there's nothing really cool about these guys that are like in the latest fashion and it now what was going on
1343.79,1345.8, one thing we do know man
1346.31,1348.59, guys have been hanging out with jesus
1349.19,1350.24, clear
1350.72,1382.16, not not to even mention the intact the evidence that a god adanson crazy and then while while there on trial while while their standing them there's a guy who was once lame that could not walk that is his dancing behind them like a cheer leader okay and so they're going hazletine in the resurrection ever a hard time with this and we don't believe anything that you're saying but it is really hard to deny the evidence of that guy that we know man he was his lame and
1382.46,1388.94, he's now dancing but like those guys know and amideo he's dancing
1389.03,1397.7, and it's hard and that we see that these guys are uneducated man it is obvious that they've been walking with cheeses
1403.22,1404.06, think
1405.53,1408.56, in any of these qualities
1409.7,1411.56, for myself
1413.45,1415.76, pray i had daily
1416.18,1418.04, that this would be true of me
1419.0,1431.78, i walk on campus for the base of the university of idaho when i come in contact with students as i interact with my wife as interact with my staff may always be said that man is
1431.9,1434.84, like dew hung out with jesus this morning
1436.85,1444.98, i don't know i don't know if i can believe everything that he says and i mean he believed some crazy stuff about that jesus like he really believes that
1445.61,1450.41, but regardless it's obvious that he spent time with him he walked with him
1451.04,1456.59, you and happens when you spend time with some one you start talking like them
1456.65,1462.17, if you was any of the people at spent this summer in santiago they all have the same jokes
1462.44,1535.58, they they all have these same little phrases that they all say they're all inside and they're not funny anybody else but they all know it and they all kind of walk the same that kind of the same language i spent a year after graduating college men a year of muster and a half living in a car with our worship leader josh martin okay josh and i kind of friends before we started okay now to this day and he is is one of my closest friends and if you hang out with us okay would very different personality but we have some aloof the same stories we have a lot of the same jokes we think a lot the same even to the point the josh tell some really brilliant jokes and gets all the credit for it but has been really honest it was my joke to begin with but he just tells it more often as though people think it is so kayasthas attentive ear and so but it is true and the reason is because we spent that much i mean literally for over a year every waking and asleep moment sad by side
1536.15,1537.74, jokes of the same
1537.89,1541.49, at this same some same mannerisms why
1542.57,1544.4, i walked out by side
1546.11,1549.14, may it be said for you and i
1550.04,1554.09, the more time that we spent with jesus walking with him
1554.57,1558.5, more time we spent with the father the more we look like the sun
1559.88,1562.37, we've been marked by christ
1563.48,1572.75, be obvious that each one of us go hey listen and you don't maybe have a lot going on you've changed your major thirty times and you're on your seventh round of school 
1573.83,1575.6, it's obvious
1576.59,1578.27, was
1579.56,1581.9, even walking the cheeses
1582.98,1584.45, last and final thing
1585.62,1587.21, message be clear
1587.84,1589.94, marked by the cross
1591.44,1592.67, the
1593.42,1597.62, motivated by a cross mark my christ marlotte by the cross
1601.64,1603.29, i 
1606.26,1610.13, in order that it may spread no further among the people
1610.82,1612.5, warn them
1613.01,1617.36, speak no more to any one in the same talking about jesus first eighteen
1617.96,1635.66, so they called them and charged them not to speak or tall in the name of jesus vesinet love it but peter and john answer them whether it is right in the sight of god to listen to you rather than to god you must judge
1635.75,1650.69, we cannot but speak of what we have seen in her the adamantine first eaten but peter and john answered to them whether it is right in the sight of god to listen to you rather than to god you must judge
1651.2,1676.73, we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard the peter and john motivated by the cross of a listen you can you can throw some prison you can be as you can do whatever you can charge us not to do it but all to me that's going to be between you and god because listen here's the deal we can not can not help but speak of the things that we've seen and heard it is changed our lives
1676.97,1695.84, and we've left everything and a chase after jesus on into going back there in a moment would you is teaching to the crowds and every one goes mad this brother is teaching some hard stuff no thanks i'm now and they walk out left with these twelve guys he looks at him and goes he are you going to leave to
1696.77,1701.3, peter says this he goes he listened jesus we've left everything to follow you

1706.49,1707.84, we go
1708.77,1713.81, but everything to chase after you have the words of eternal life when not going anywhere
1715.22,1716.36, and now
1717.71,1725.45, standing before the engine man had denied jesus whose promachos nihilist amen
1727.19,1730.61, i saw a man placed on a cross i watched him die

1743.72,1745.4, what i have to do
1745.55,1754.85, it's like the same languages gear my twenty first night dear miss as this is a bit of i say i will not mention his word or speak any more in his name
1755.06,1765.35, his word is in my heart like a fire a fire shut up in my bones and i am weary of holding it in indeed i cannot say language
1766.61,1772.19, inferences this this christ love that compels us

1959.78,1966.44, fearful that will leave this place and disco carlos's try harder had before motivated
1968.81,1970.67, i don't know if that works
1971.48,1973.85, i think the answer is more will power
1974.6,1980.63, so far as our message being clear the only way it gets clear as by us articulating in practicing the message
1981.32,1993.38, that's what people that don't know jesus and we continue to tell our story until the story was whether with our friends were containing ourselves a story though the way we get better and language as we practise it
1993.47,1997.37, better a telling stories as we practiced telling the stories
2000.22,2003.85, we get marked by the cross like a share with you
2005.95,2010.27, and as contributes its sounds its suspending time which ceases
2012.37,2015.34, how do we get motivated than by the cross
2017.05,2019.63, for me it's simply remembering
2021.16,2053.89, reminding myself of the cross and what happened is i can romans twelve and therefore in light of everything that god has done may continue to be motivated by the cross may continue to offer my life so living sacrifice here twelve the saitic our eyes on the author and the protector of our faith jesus christ fixer eyes on him we remember what he did as he was very motivated by the cars very motivated by the cross he fixed his eyes on the cross and for the joy set before him he endured the cross and the shame and the pain that was wrapped up in that
2055.15,2056.77, we were a member
2057.13,2060.01, so that we don't grow tired and weary
2060.46,2062.56, not finish the race
2063.76,2064.78, remember
2069.64,2070.63, i was in
2070.72,2078.97, i just started following jesus and i remember there was a faint old him i got remade and so i kind of
2079.03,2084.37, so called minerva the wondrous cross began
2084.43,2118.09, said watson able josh repapering whatsisname from the notes and he wrote it and satanstoe hundred hymns including the very popular joy to the world and in this one and that he wrote and talked about fixing his eyes on the cross i surmised to it by popular worship leader but essentially this was the
2118.78,2120.94, the radio
2123.25,2125.26, the wonderful cross
2126.31,2128.11, bid me come
2130.18,2132.52, find that i may truly live
2133.03,2146.65, he says this were the whole realm of nature mine manetho was all mine own ness entire worldness was going to be my offering my gift to the lord he says were the whole realm of nature mine
2147.19,2150.19, a present far too small
2150.46,2154.33, love so amazing so divine a love this
2154.87,2157.21, demands my soul
2157.42,2158.74, my life
2165.22,2167.59, and light of all that god has done
2169.9,2172.87, he deserves nothing less than our all
2175.12,2178.03, if you hear anything from me please here this night
2180.37,2183.58, ask for us to lay it all down
2184.36,2187.33, under every piece of us to him
2187.63,2196.33, just our sunday nights not just our village nights not just a bible study in the morning he asked for every single piece of us
2196.99,2203.2, the cross bids us come die but it's in that moment that we find that we truly live
2206.5,2208.0, hear me say this
2210.1,2212.47, jesus is unbelievably worse than
2214.78,2223.42, and everything that you place at his feet everything that you surrender everything that you give to him he's unbelievably worth it
2225.55,2227.05, so were it
2229.0,2230.44, so worth it
2232.03,2238.18, business came and lay all down at its feet and everything that we tenderer thing that we give him is worth it
2240.13,2241.84, see the story in closing
2244.57,2257.29, first starting a ministry and in traveling at kanero a little bit i remember being at a camp and i was sitting next to the speaker we were in the back and like second third rode on the back and there was a guy kind of in front of us to the ride and
2257.41,2266.08, like it is mid thirties and remember i saw really would paying attentions malign front of us and during the worship time
2266.5,2280.51, even at this day i don't think of ever seeing some one worship with such abandonment a man just man it is arms high and just moving to like me losing his mind and these songs
2281.29,2293.83, and the guy there was with the gun imhotep towards the end worship he sits down and kind of tap me on the shoulder and erasing christendome overhearing this and just said he he said i got to ask
2294.1,2299.05, is it how how are you able to worship like this
2299.29,2311.41, a coward you able to just kind of dislike and not worry about people right metellus your mind in front of jesus i completely render everything in this moment how do you do that and the gods respond with
2311.8,2313.75, what you talking about
2314.77,2319.0, and so the homes is you realize that smouldered
2319.45,2322.51, no one else is worshipping like you are
2323.77,2329.86, a response is the moment i think it kind of click for both of us and so what do you mean i'm to only one where shipping like this
2330.52,2337.39, a moment and a light kind of click on and see that gaze over his eyes realizing that he was blind
2338.62,2341.53, walk into this moment
2342.55,2373.54, meet with the king of the universe and with reckless abandon is going to worship this god is it couldn't help to speak of these things that were inside of it was burning and sadat get loose and he had no idea that this wasn't the reaction of every follower of jesus he is assumption was that every fought you want dead and now you're alive motivated by the cross or mars by christ like maitresse clear it gets its obvious you can lose your mind for jesus because he's done so much for you and i
2375.16,2377.5, his response haunts me today
2378.4,2380.08, he may want
2384.37,2386.32, not be said of us
2388.36,2391.78, we leave this place my our message be really clear
2393.22,2396.79, marked by crises obvious we've been with him
2398.17,2401.41, be motivated and propelled by the cross
2405.25,2411.52, and the band up and we're going to continue in some time at a time of worship and
2413.5,2459.43, it is your first time here it resonated frontier a time of communion and oussoor left unto you right i will testation bread and juice and a man on the night that jesus portrayed he gathers as close as voice together in a room and he has his one last meal and he he spurs us on to to remember remember what he's done less we forget or so and were so easily forget but we forget the cross to forget what christ did for us which i do this thing on our own and he said he take command every time you do this remember what i did for you that my blood was shed for you and said the juice it represents christ blood that was shed on a cross to redeem us to pay the debt that we owe
2460.09,2464.56, we break the bread remembering the christ body was broken for us
2466.42,2467.74, and we remember
2470.08,2472.51, we just really prone to forget
2473.92,2481.69, it's inanities of worship you have an opportunity to discount of head that direction to break the bread to dip it in the juice
2481.9,2482.83, remember
2485.08,2486.13, the worship
2486.55,2487.78, it
2493.78,2495.28, not forget

2499.48,2506.89, they are message to world of your death burial and resurrection be so clear
2508.18,2516.28, time with you mark us to where we began to look less similar old cells and more and more like you jesus because that's our hope
2518.83,2521.98, in the days that are really hard and the days that we forget
2523.03,2524.71, we look to the cross
2526.06,2527.62, we had that direction
