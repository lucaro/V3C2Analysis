0.15,8.88, i caroline
15.9,26.88, welcome to another to trial this is new from life picture we're going to be looking at
27.42,34.2, basically how to sell your projects work in the venturesome
35.13,46.17, a kind of being through this a little bit in previous to trial which was a bit longer was quite long and but this one's going to look here the life this project manager
46.47,48.6, and projects settings
48.87,50.4, so
50.61,55.32, look at how we can work with dice
56.07,57.45, prime
57.48,59.43, prime
59.43,64.17, so was really important and very useful in the natal
64.29,69.78, with the finest setting gainsaying to rise you know you've got a problem
69.93,76.14, the future so obviously we know we can see the time basis twenty ten eight
76.23,79.68, the frame is the sizes and all that as all good
80.85,82.68, frame
82.68,84.93, the source fire is also
85.08,89.16, on that we can see that this frame race
89.49,95.73, go down a little bit we can see is by tens we know the sequence is matching
95.88,98.64, everything that assails also
99.12,104.43, yes i ever thing is matching this is our perfection perfect afar
104.85,107.94, we can go into the fire and explore
108.48,110.94, and protect somehow
111.09,117.78, to this as to just because he has run uproar as to
118.05,127.95, and say doesn't take very long to do examiner will come up to usually because of some issues micure
128.52,133.8, filled his staff a tactile aethere when your
134.13,140.31, it came between prime and unconsoled jump back into
140.91,147.99, project manager so project manager has default sayings always homoeopathist
148.26,166.14, create a project the august nineteen twenty by twenty four so we can see the twenty four frame is come up this is the teasing soon that we know that they are not making so offering it on matching from or what we're going to use in our souls for an forego
166.71,168.36, incorrect
168.93,170.64, we can do with that
170.88,173.49, have a look a project setting
173.55,178.41, project settings and the most important one in our party setting in our conformations
178.83,180.27, i
180.66,182.67, work between
183.06,192.18, masailand evince sogers make sure that this one is matching and stick on the outrooting
192.48,199.86, the source in the source citations find you can also from the source cliffmore you wanted to
201.48,203.46, i change these
203.64,206.43, just so then i know
206.73,210.54, stingaree matching in everything so we go with her
210.54,213.27, family change
213.45,219.03, well happy with all of this were happy with forty two because we know its progress
219.69,223.98, go in to her and tantalise
224.16,230.16, conform is a good will he apply we can also look at our capture and play back
230.22,238.59, and this just because i like to have conformity across like everything i know it's all the same to to to
238.59,243.3, for with you why 
243.42,248.25, a fine because we are using progression for two to his alcove
250.2,254.55, so we hear apply again so now we should
255.0,261.72, when we go to look at sorpiala's quickly and have a look at our sort for
264.18,269.37, make sure you import all of those sources that you already edited
269.4,279.09, that you haven't edited the loins the whereabout it so now here's a clear nineteen ten eight pro resort to so the whitefoot is magic
282.45,288.84, saying my conform sayings on my saying here tauane
289.29,290.64, i 
290.91,296.76, now when i implore this into my media pool nothing happened
296.97,301.62, that blazing nothing's happened because we matched all the sayings across the board
302.58,305.97, very cool if the same to match
306.18,307.23, and
307.38,311.46, you would have to do is it would come up with a kind of small little box
311.64,315.48, about her somewhere here and they were basically say
316.11,321.18, projects do not you know your project saying does not match your cliff saying
321.75,323.19, do you want to hang
323.28,326.64, of you want to change it though that all you want to
326.76,331.86, and it manuelito before you actually start implying your media
331.98,333.12, i suggest
333.33,334.98, set up
335.7,339.06, and then you'd have to worry about it you know itself and it's good to go
339.6,349.47, so that is basically the media that i've got im premier these are little afoot in my time line stasis what i'm working with
349.68,352.38, so when i'm in here i've got these six
352.5,355.95, well i'm in here i've got a seidlitz
357.42,359.22, and
359.28,363.12, and this is where i would just go in and i would import my amount

365.88,369.0, he has my amount just to exham
369.09,370.41, that
370.47,377.46, this is also going to then tell us our information sequence one was the name of the time line
377.88,379.59, there employing
379.59,384.45, in ante and these araminty nine point nine seven
384.48,390.15, using this obviously this is coming from pinacate export in the
390.42,394.77, from primus it doesn't make any real difference so he 
395.04,402.81, obviously i've got for of twenty two clips were not yet found now if i look
404.22,406.98, a lot of stuff i got
407.28,408.63, in my
409.98,419.49, project folders i've galatians are not worried so i think really care and also the text
419.64,427.65, there is probably not recognizing these one two three four pieces of tax because i have an important those pieces attack
428.1,436.77, i don't want to tecolote no i don't want to search for it there all derelicts failed to impart
436.77,437.79, five
438.15,439.59, because it's a
440.04,445.02, and then we go so implored my exam is now matches
