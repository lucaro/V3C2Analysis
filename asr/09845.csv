0.63,12.33, i'm so glad all you come to day because
13.2,15.63, relief
15.99,18.96, actually a little bit nervous
19.44,27.63, the doutelle body out there because i'm just going to look right here because you guys make me feel really good and you all came to share with us to day
31.02,38.79, actually is really the way it is and actually when henry was talking earlier
39.0,44.61, talking about what kin do what we can learn from kids that first thing i noticed when i stuck out of the room
44.61,46.65, like how spread out we are
46.86,51.45, even though were fewer people today were still spread out all the way to the corners
51.6,59.16, how many times i've gone in to speak with it and his tolerant like they all collect on top each other right in front
59.55,70.8, learn about that why they're doing that i think i'm like so thither it's been such a great conference so far i hope i can add to that
70.83,76.98, so many great talks and so many great presentations and honestly
77.49,98.25, completely messed up my mind i have we were in this thing probably ten times since i've been here it's not easy to come toward the end because all this stuff is happening all these fantastic talks and people talking about things and i'm in a quandary of what i could add to all that that might bring meaning to all of you
98.82,115.08, on the other side were personally it's been great to be here because it's given me time out it's given me an a couple of my team members here time to sit back and reflect on what we started five years ago and really where we've come and i think
115.17,144.21, we manage to bring you know really design on you know as an equal part of the whole business not to be leading not to be on top but as an equal partnership through the whole business and so i thought you know that's what i'll just share with you all to day some of the very simple things i think when i show you that she would wintaire simple and basic yea and i think that's actually why it helped us to whoredom basic simple things that all share
145.02,167.73, of last year at the synthesis may be i can lick right yeah i can lick she'll last year we were merely honored to receive and in idea or his silver ware that's craig he's here he could tell you all about it and that changed our arrest was important for us
167.82,174.09, the companies are rallied around that and kind of understood because there were so many people behind that project
174.36,183.12, and so now this year were on stage here and so i'll tell a little bit about that journey how the companies changed and how we got to where we are
183.24,184.44, first
184.65,197.82, importantly i think this is saturday morning right say morning gasometer saturday morning right okay so samarin so said back we lag in another bull captain crunch
198.36,204.51, the captain and next time and and i miss going to start with a little story here to set the stage okay
205.08,211.05, so this is what a kindergarten class looked like in nineteen seventy
211.17,213.87, anybody from kindergarten here
214.35,215.94, a garden
215.97,221.7, against they looked a little funny don't they like loose weird clothes
221.73,226.02, this was my kindergarten class in california back in 
228.09,247.65, she looks nice but that once she was really touch he used to grab our ears and this when george george was very appropriate and i named because he was a little bit like curious george he was always trying new things he was adventurous he also tended to get in trouble
248.46,255.72, this was myself here i'm not sure i don't think my dad knew how to use a bowl i'm not sure what with the hair cut
255.81,259.14, anyway there we were and we were good buddies
259.65,276.36, and in the kindergarten we spent most of our time whenever we could outdoors it was santa barbara so you could be out doors almost all the time and there was sort of a little house as all are where we can run around but the best thing was is it one up on a hill and these hills were covered by bushes
276.36,279.06, and beyond the bushes was a chain link fence
279.6,294.48, and the bushes were great because you can make all kinds of past the bushes you know when we broke off all the branches and we had little burros and little high ways and little forts and there and we felt like we were miles away
294.57,300.39, everybody but of course missus swanson there could always just by nellie's back in a minute
300.51,302.4, one day out there
303.12,309.18, i heard george call out call out and help o some kind o how i'm stuck or something like that
309.66,311.4, when i came to george
311.82,317.19, i found that he had a hand full of these big juicy berries blackberries
318.93,323.49, problem was his hand was on the other side of the chain league fence
324.45,330.87, put his hand through a chain legend to grab his berries and now that he had them
330.99,335.58, certainly didn't want to let him go but he didn't want his hand to be on the other side of the fence
336.15,341.49, so i don't really recall how we got there you know this was quite a long time ago
341.49,343.89, a few years and
344.34,355.95, but somehow together we figured out that what we would do if he would drop the berries as close to the fence as he could and then we could sort of finger them through many unstick and kind
356.01,358.41, through there so
358.65,364.29, wasn't completely open to this because after all he did have the very in his head
364.77,374.16, he did and they were a little bit dusty and catamites must but we got some of the berries to the other side
376.2,409.26, so really there's nothing remark about you george nothing will actually to his but there's nothing remarkable about me there's nothing remark about this story is what happens on the playground all the time like i'm sure all you have made me get your hands stuck in a fence or something like that i'm sure all knew out there can remember times were when you were allowed to play play freely when you are allowed to follow your own narrative and just go ward took you without sort of the interference and hovering a parent in his god into all kinds of adventures like this
410.04,413.37, and for me personally i think back at this
413.52,423.69, this little story here quite often because when i look at it it contains sort of for i don't at all factors or elements or or experiences
424.05,428.1, that i think i still live on every day
428.58,432.69, so i'm just going to take a minute to walk through how i saw that picture
432.75,437.16, so the first thing i was empathy
437.55,445.71, also we were a lot about empty at this conference and i've been really
446.1,463.56, you know very happy to hear people talk about it and not just talking about it and the four insertions for our tea made and within for other people round the board table who look at things different to have different backgrounds to this and i'm just going to take a minute because like that worrell really important
463.8,472.05, this like the greatest thing you guys all do it's the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing
473.31,482.82, in their frame of reference right getting outside ourselves and seeing and that's what we all do right and that's how this story started
483.0,492.27, nothing special on me empathy for george's situation like oh man he wants the berries his hand is over there you know and then came what
493.38,509.25, some critical thinking i'll be probably very primitive critical thinking but you know we went to this process like hey hand and berries are going to have to separate in order that work this way out unless we just want like jam or something pulled through the fence
509.55,526.26, so you know and then a little great problem solving we probably could have solved it a lot a lot of other ways may be if we were taller we could like slowly lifting them up over maybe take him one berry through at a time i don't know but you know we got the job done well enough and the reason for our success
526.8,529.83, was really due to collaboration
529.92,534.21, and i could imagine that there was probably not a whole lot of communication
534.84,537.09, there was a whole lot of trust
537.9,545.7, elaboration a good amount of or enough communication but a whole lot of trust i think that's actually the proportions of that
546.3,555.21, anyway so i tell the story obviously because that's what we did as kids naturally every day on the playground that's what we still do to day
555.51,563.73, what we need today when we make a product as we do when we build a team is also what we do we sit around a tent figure out how to lead the company
566.82,574.41, for getting back to the company about five seven years ago this is what the company looked like
574.41,577.71, good solid
578.73,581.91, and equipment from the north american market
583.08,591.69, i go as far as to say it was traditional bit same same in the market didn't really identify itself so differently from what the other
591.78,593.67, manufacturers were making
593.88,595.8, it was a family on business
596.28,597.9, been built up
598.62,606.54, the industry the industry went through a way of safety and lots of playgrounds out to be taken out and new ones had to be put into the whole industry went up
606.69,607.56, this
607.83,627.9, company also went up with that but it wasn't really built on you know a kind of design background in fact i think some of the people that were there before me would say you know the father and the son in the family would come down and say designers he draws up a bunch of great pretty pictures and lilith one we like and that's what we'll do
627.9,629.58, it was probably something like that
630.0,638.61, and there was no plan but no process there was no procedure marked steady or things like that to really get products out
638.67,653.79, in the field so i was very fortunate five years ago to move from denmark back to night states and joined the team because there was a great team of designers and there was a team of engineers who had been there later and knew all about this industry
653.91,661.26, there was a lot to build and there was a great lean manufacturing so we had everything from you know sails marketing manufacturing
661.5,664.77, engineering they had all the way through from start to finish
664.95,667.47, so
667.8,671.58, the first thing we did is decided you know we're just going to start at the beginning
671.91,683.82, i start and you don't even have to look at that i mean what is going to start with a simple milestone process right we knew all the things we had to go on we knew we couldn't jump on over it in the steps
684.09,691.26, we know even though we throw tons of money at some of these steps we couldn't make some of them go any faster
692.25,709.47, we also knew if we kept interrupting ourselves as we had been doing we were never going to make it then if we let sails suddenly come run in one day ago oh i just lost a project i now need something that does this because the competition has it we would never get done when we are actually playing in a hidden
709.98,721.41, principle is kind i always talked about like look here on a wreath which trying to get to chicago if we keep making me to our sides and life were never going to get there that's really where we want to go
721.92,730.5, we got this milestone process going we got to sea on board he was actually very favorable to this understood the need for it
730.98,738.33, the director marketing director sails and so on and we made this plan and we are all said
739.14,747.33, i run about two weeks later in the so called head of engineering and said in like to work you guys to work on some different products
747.96,754.14, or like the whole plan was starting to rode into solo lots of push back
754.14,781.14, stay firm and i think for a couple of years there my main job which is to repeat and repeat and protect that plan protect what we had going for us and one of the things that helped was that this kind of thing was so easy to draw right i mean so it wasn't just a philosophy or in some some filing cabinet or up on the wall one place in the building pretty because this was so easy we began drawing it all the time
781.14,798.27, i can start drawing it engineer is central so in every meeting any time we can refer back and we did it again and again and again through the years we even got tattoo made a heated like remember the mile to process
799.08,803.28, so having something that was also very simple to communicate with her important
803.49,805.59, the next thing we did
805.59,809.64, we changed our space a little bit
809.67,823.89, change the interior not with a big decoration but just opened it up we started putting more things on the wall we started inviting other parts parts of you know department to come down and see what we were doing and we change this base so this is our outdoor little area
824.01,828.0, i'm upon the balcony at a three story balcony looking down
828.06,840.54, this was just sort of a grass many times muddy area right outside our little design space so we got permission to put in concrete and and we started building things out there
840.63,842.52, everybody can see them
842.64,845.76, and we started having plates
845.79,855.87, my gosh like we never had plates at this company before i imagine since the seventies they never really had like kids in a testing before they went out in any kind of
856.02,868.32, significant or real way so this is a play testing kids these are our from some local after school programs the man what most important about this picture because i know you guys all do this kind of stuff
869.01,874.38, most important are these two right here so this is robin and barbara
874.65,890.61, there in the marketing department it was like the first time we started bringing departments together so early in the process but they wanted they saw what we were doing and they wanted to come down and be part of it and held so that they can build it into their story and make it there as is well
891.84,899.88, that kind of developed in other places and here again is romantical see which is a huge smile on a face it also changed her work
900.03,903.66, and brought her more into what was ringing on in the company
905.07,912.57, because we invited everybody and told her body this was going on we started to get other people
912.81,923.19, round on the balconies people coming out of like you no can people finance people or whoever we invited their children to be part of the plates
923.43,926.52, the huge thing someone i think it was 
926.82,936.42, it is fantastic ten points the other day you know he was lionised some things don't show it down their throats but just like noisome things and find out what sticks
938.34,950.19, nothing we started doing and we know we insure playing full but but we started talking about tea we start talking about tea allot and at first for maybe two years there were
950.43,966.06, pirouetting about tea and i like look we're going to have a whole teams and working holtei all you designers are you engineers are unburthen the word teams i call come together to work in the project and you come together
966.33,973.26, and i never knew you know that's actually men there in the blue pants and there sing i never knew i can draw so much for my own personal background
973.26,994.05, i like all of us like hey what else do we do in our lives that like so applicable to what we do now because in this situation you got a move as one in a very small space you've got a sound as one you got to stay the same rhythm in the same beat and you've got to play it all the way through to the end of the can't stop in the middle you can't divert to something else
994.53,996.63, on your keeping the rhythm
997.56,1003.62, and you got to practice and practice and practice i mean it's always that we got to keep practice and we've got to keep doing the drills
1004.4,1027.26, at about ten and again you can do this very easily anybody can draw this hey were ten were all connected like this were from different apartments in fact when we start drawing us we realize we are missing the project carthaginian actually we don't have a protector maybe that's why things are you know always going so well so we got ourselves a protector so we can do this
1027.86,1029.48, we read a book
1029.84,1037.76, i don't know if any of you read this book but within roderigh a book about theory or design theory or process of pressure lean
1037.82,1043.16, we all read those things that just a normal book but it talks about importance of being 
1043.19,1048.14, really having the right people rolling in the direction we together
1049.55,1055.22, about the house these guys are hoarded in not so much the what but the house
1055.22,1069.62, i mean by that we are all designers were all makers of things but gets when there are a lot of makers of things and their other makers of things making other products in other companies yeah we do that but how do we know it how do we know it as a team how do we play
1069.65,1080.12, what are the rules we set you guys play soccer or with the kind that trip people on the way the kind of disobediently the game this way this is our code
1080.3,1088.82, really important so far as to say that the team this is when you're going to be evaluated on at the enemy now what you do
1088.91,1097.61, doing great design i'm going to tell you what you want how you're doing it how you're doing together clambering in your team but all with other departments
1099.05,1104.93, simply i don't even know what you call the thing innovation cur or something like that this is not my specialty
1105.38,1120.65, we have something like this some marketing thought we were going there and sail thought we were going there and product a we are going there until we started drawing this and communicating and even the cows started drawing this we didn't know like this is where we're trying to head with this project
1120.95,1127.25, a really simple basic chancing things that we just started sharing again and again and again
1128.36,1137.09, another one this is second last we recently we required we went from one playground brand to five
1137.3,1142.07, a trial this how do we design for distinguished
1142.37,1151.04, many five different brands so again a very simple model that we started sharing with sails we start saying look you guys
1151.13,1156.92, everything can be exclusive to your brand west we're going to have to share some things
1157.25,1165.41, we had to start having those tugs about what are we going to share across the different brands across different reposes regroup
1165.8,1177.26, you know one some things that are in the middle there like things that you can think of that and the same chase that had the same sort of under structure but looked different looked like the brand and actually this was then adopted by the sales
1177.29,1183.17, and the border directors i mean they made it in rectangle sieges they like rectangles better but
1183.56,1186.77, at one year that's simeon to me right now
1186.8,1198.38, is that so my own innovation as vice president innovation it's like so important for me and always has been to have this kind of balance
1198.92,1200.75, and a lineman
1201.11,1208.67, and sales and i found that if one of those legs is too short or one of those is overpowering the others
1208.94,1211.01, not that whole process
1211.73,1228.95, a model which raged all the time gimme the tripod we have to be united we have to be a line we have to be supporting each other and equal and i find that when they're equal there's a natural tension and that tension brings more dialogue if one stronger is just like
1229.79,1231.17, do it this way
1231.98,1233.81, all right
1234.2,1247.43, what we were we were so gracefully awarded on a war for last year and i think you know all those things i just showed did make a difference to our company it brought us to a new place
1247.79,1257.72, and it increased our effectiveness increased our efficiency or timeliness or or a respect for each other or tamperin
1258.11,1262.28, really helped us to get to our most important goal
1263.0,1277.19, which was twenty billion lass we got him we reached it and i can tell you how many billions in smiles we got but these are a few of the things we've done the last few and i'm just going to go through the berry
1278.0,1284.0, it's got a sculpture and can see its years all different ways but all different age groups
1284.21,1302.66, twas one of the earlier ones just about taking that classic play done that everybody knew all adults knew all kids knew it just wasn't really that easy to build war most kids are trying leroy know just changing out redesign that simple changes but with a
1302.93,1306.68, here's another project we didn't last couple o years
1307.07,1315.44, just letting it all out transparent not a lot of walls and barriers you can just get there you can choose your own route to the play
1315.8,1317.72, one for the smaller kids
1318.02,1330.59, again another functional test we make these things bring him in to all these little blocks and you can build and bring a vous you can't do yourself but i mean ourselves people can can arrange these in all different sizes and shapes
1332.81,1362.15, project we did with the architect which a dane who did some of the fantastic place bases and sexual part back in the seventies we revived this project with him his great collaboration and i have to do it a pitch for the design museum foundation if you don't know it there a wonderful foundation to work with they formed an incredible show like all new have kids or ever worked like anybody here has ever been a kid i should go check this out it's been traveling from boston
1362.48,1371.0, and san francisco chicago and we love to bring in here to atlanta and body else you know one to bring that about its lethaliter of play and design
1371.0,1384.29, where that's been through the years so great great group to work with lastly this is a new one infinite skin combining some of the traditional things with some new things in the first instance francisco still going on
1386.36,1392.3, all that was a lot to say so what about the business part well
1392.9,1399.08, i started just as a little architect making some things and i as a designer in this now i'm
1399.35,1405.8, in this global innovation thing i really ask for that but i find like i'm doing the same thing
1405.8,1412.49, the same thing as i did with george back on the playground you know i'm trying to be empathetic
1412.55,1418.94, a twenty years my skill with you know critical thinking and creative problem solving in collaboration
1419.66,1424.37, now one of the things i noticed around we can all remember this i noticed around the table
1424.52,1428.78, executive table is a lot of those educations that i have
1429.05,1430.43, problem solving
1430.7,1432.14, at
1432.44,1443.39, that's something we have to be empathetic about were using all this language and we have all these expectations sometimes like how can they can't just an go through this process we have to understand that that's our rule
1445.01,1452.81, i look back at that voluble i was the center that was my role i wasn't the middle blocker i know a there identity
1453.17,1455.18, we need each other around the table
1456.59,1464.24, so our role as you know understanding or dipping into apathy and these other processes and collaboration
1464.72,1466.82, i support
1467.24,1496.79, collaboration as that a pony one could like sometimes seriously and the executive meantime i have to say give doubt don you remember don't you remember building with blocks don't you member when you started with his blocks and then your friend added some more and you build something new and then you said that's good aforehand we can do this or you said an what if we tried this
1496.85,1511.94, to drop the berries liberation i am having to support and encourage all the time in that group is as if they forgotten like lessons on the play growling and line were not pushing at the top of the slide or like digging a hole together to china
1516.02,1518.93, that's been my rule to remind
1519.08,1521.0, but it
1522.17,1525.26, sometimes they'll have to say
1525.41,1532.04, really wonder how business functions at all like this whole business things new to me in how does it function at all
1532.43,1533.9, a designer
1533.93,1535.19, the executive
1536.93,1541.85, actually the days i mainsel how does government function at all
1542.12,1543.26, with that
1543.26,1547.79, and not to get political but thomas jefferson architect
1547.79,1550.4, franklin incredible inventor
1550.43,1554.48, overall range of things where are those kinds of people today
1555.17,1557.12, that level
1557.81,1566.69, so i would encourage any new i guess that's my last message any of you who had the chance or of the dream or the wish to get a little bit
1568.07,1582.02, in that table in that kind of work you know even if it means leaving your pencil and paper behind it and if you still use a pencil an paper issue en if it means leaving that behind you don't take that jump because you know what
1582.29,1591.47, ernestine what we do not because we know something special now because i do something special to save the
1591.47,1596.96, this company but because we're important team member 
1597.59,1610.34, thank you very much
