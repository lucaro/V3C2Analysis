39.87,43.71, one word i would labourer the fact is redemption
43.77,46.71, in miami who took advantage
46.8,79.5, later in the season and then we got back at syracuse on the game that we deserve the wind in miami will in that pretty commencing convincingly sixty seven to fifty eight we we got up we got a kind of big than they came back before minutes and were like economising pretty pretty good seaworthy four points are bound up does lateranus rossitur out probably one of his biggest game of the year in that game with twenty two points and he was favorable
79.65,91.11, i was like if we lost that game this season would have been so bad like everybody would have been really down drawing matter seascale pretty much meat no insentient whatsoever and then
91.83,126.18, came i think that whole thing was just like a boy don't like kind of deal like we were in redemption for what happened to us at syracusan it was really good one you say bottleholder well in the first half i mean it was ridiculous if we were shooting seventy per cent they were shoneen and wenaston a cat was killing it and we came out cold outshining
126.3,153.45, a huge huge austere forestelle one thing i know the sarcumstance is lost i will get on to the regimental it but and i patout man amber head temporising one man burgers more than a point i feel like the wolf pack to really good because it means he's getting into it as long as tecetl scorn his point two points a game i feel like a vandenberg can put on a good show going into the rest of this this year
153.87,192.15, tonnerre stepped about for me like where's title and what is as i think they really fallen off especially though often so sidenote were very strong team i think i think that's lolloping made the whole year but kaliston away from being aggressive on the office asininities in the securities of sankum shot i feel like a year i've been a hester year i said he's not favorite god and he's got a jump ship at an they see tereus like wind drives off the back of the rout contortionist
193.14,219.54, we see it sunday night when in testation out that they were going to be in the incitement the reaction be priceless james aisopion of itand there so many good parts about this videoconference i think the best part is robes the strength and condition of the old gentleman he esteemed and he's gone idsleigh tackling family members in the background the like
219.84,267.93, hold him bag somebody get him under control and then i think the best part is embryos that bed and minauderie best bread and be days going to break lennard and half like his holding him so hard but most part of it that is as you see misionarios the first one up when the name popped up like he watched and sometimes are alike and not already knew who was going to be in ermeland then be as on his arm and their jumping up and down and then there's some skinny as i do say muskingon's kind of a like who is it but he's just hold on the bed for dear life just ring and like a like a bull or something it was cold warious and then if you see in the back corner i mean cats back there like you cast this cool in it cat is always just the cool cat he's the bitten
268.26,291.03, on the turn and then a beethoven patriotism to say that last collapsing times they say he said it like four five more times or is going crazy and then i want to say i love the part beyond lenormant the background hug and dancing when my fair part
292.5,354.45, in a like like seriously as like all they need is like some music in the barsom white in the background is like a halo and like all like that or something just because he is like so happy is priceless it business like shell shocked by this he's never seen baptists dramatic and then also got tideward who was like i had to watch the video like five times in the tientietnikov the corner like in the first reaction i've seen em like you are to any costantina second reaction you see him hugging rossitur and he like issuing saying like told you were going to tollitt's what i get out of it but that's only time i saw in the video as he and the earlier fidei think so then like barrancos to noon everybody on what to do so
355.68,411.03, look at how many state baseball it seemed maybe into the turnament by some miracle i had as already out of here out of the ardent the unit i don't know how he did it but lilienthal no i really i mean i know what we've done the worn acushla the year i feel like that was our greatest accomplishment i mean we did galoret thanks for how young we were how many people we lost but coming out the sericane losing the clumps in and then going into the carolina game i think we'd be virginia agatha but they go into the carolinian once we lost a caliginous we went all these games and when they streathmere's no way but we did and i think it is a theatre
411.03,421.62, i was floored by this i was sitting on a couch and one person we did talk about and the reaction video is chase can in and he is like he's looked like he's about to cry because
421.74,451.17, with him i had no idea that we can even possibly make it into his torment i have tableau i mean they were talking about some who had a fantastic season they only lost nine games it is here and i know the strength of schedules a little bit lanyere like that but i didn't think i mean i thought we were going to be the first untameable and then even people were outraged in infinite
451.17,516.06, north dakota a few saw lowered his head for that i guess well we had gone for was the fact that though we be my amelie syracusan syracuse and i don't really i don't really completely understander stand it all so great where what they exalt but it makes you look at it besides all the virginia and the duke gave the roses no one like we had a lot of great game we just couldn't finish and end the syracusan should have been we should be in the first time we got seventeen o two we just i don't know what happened i gave him the telltale second half but apparently our art are out of conference schedules early strong and we we dominate our conference charentonneau i mean if you're from in power conference a little bit different from being in football but if your green bay or somewhere and that it was like the bubbles
516.06,521.16, i can't i can't think that team over the assets a day
522.03,604.29, on tuesday night and see that started the inca turn me against number twelve scene xavier they won the game seventy four to fifty nine pretty impress a match when you say adansonia it was fantastic from intestate perspective was a little bit worried because i've seen him before where we're at point a point on the second half and then and then they make a run and the word right back in it but tallushatchee mean he had more assistant threadbare had a hundred to enter and was feeling awful and he knew he couldn't go out of the game because cat was a very productive so he did went off i mean him and banbury had it gone like they did in the president was not point last night any time he scores a point and he says come to good looking forward in the rest of this incitement looking forward to thursday night against saint louis and then if they can win that game and keep going all loveliness
604.44,647.79, simkins stent basilicon sister yet the simeonite rossitur was seventeen points against ever he started to score some consistent point we need that tear at a very slow start on tuesday night he don't think he scored before the first commercial time out and you you asked where was clashing he wasn't really i don't know if you ever showed up to day secure but he showed up last night i think he intuitions but all six of those points were in the first ten points the game he kept us in that game while t j was a goot hour to thus early on tuesday night sorry and he just was a sworn something seemed like something was wrong in any way most her as ankle pretty bad at least a list
647.82,658.53, not for the litvanian credit i mean ostentation tinged and criticized for not being the best cause really good recruiter
658.53,689.85, made it three three one three years in the least every single year a wind so i got free really easy fortune than for intimacy double and and he's really done a great job with his team that was expected to be like an basement of the literati or tent not an incident and he's doing great things one question when you hear him talk to the selling george bush you don't know his like some kind of car salesman something yamagutchi going on notting they've got bright is looking forward
690.45,779.43, the men's vassals was not the only time to make it to the incitement for basketball sake also the women made it an incubation by this mark twenty second logan hesitate woman's basketball team i'm excited i'm happy for i love the third they're going to be dancing along with the guys but i'm worried i mean going into the asturian shake interest marquisette yearningly martialing is coming back from incommodities blow that i think that's like that's almost as bad as as the mintmaster so many points for she sucaret like we talked about before they're the inside out inattention by nothing pleasanter
779.43,786.21, a little bit shaky because defensible thereto is any tenantable really i mean obviously
786.24,891.78, mandane and you come thataway fayaway both brace because they just run the table every single year you know it's going to come down to them but i think it's really good for us if they win one game to games by instead after that but this will be a very successful season for them and one to miles for west when it comes to acting a priori get to the third round they have i want to say so so they got a pretty tough schedule as they can win a couple of games one thing going back to coach was more is he was nasmith he's in the running for the macbeth college coat of the years one fineless going to be on itinerates you come in your first year and take a team like incitations baseball team and you haven't his rank as they got up to it i think i hear he did a fantastic job with the girls and i feel like i know the losing a couple of big girls like big players this year in my sister marquisates goodheartedness

954.0,956.73, i don't think that
956.76,962.16, chances of having a veteran line of next year are going to be very strong without

1145.07,1150.26, i am i'm accountable for the game so far other we played
1151.94,1183.17, and eight or something like that and up the winding what i got to do to help his team win to be honest without me the team wouldn't we all spoke earlier this year about us winning two or three twenty three games are we young to be over or under i think without me distant going anywhere near twenty three winds but i believe we can do it with mehitable
1183.23,1224.45, opposed to baseball pitching on her hand as we do in soft ball is a more than natural motion so the arm on sustain it a lot longer i know this because i'm a self allotted me i could throw two hundred and fifty pitches in one feel anything so i fell like we're going to we're going to go out there i want to help us win tenterground things as sure when they see that's all i owe have to roll lay to day and what a toreador big finish

1272.9,1275.9, i can if i were one i got to say
1276.02,1286.49, as said i'm not worried about this like it not a big view of because we've already made the insentient omaha and really
1286.49,1340.67, the only name is really matters about the team i mean treherne was the other big name and he's only hidden three sixteen right now so me me james is very critical of the team right now because it is not the seabird and find as long as they still out you and you and see and climbing as i celimene in the conference now long as they have these big names on the schedule i'm still worried about the baseball team but not worry for carlos is you are you saying that is canadien from basketball were with seelencult years he had assomption to the draft he would have probably had a higher stock and said he stays another year is to drops because i didn't have a great year back apostate decides to stay you don't think that is saaeme effect in baseball no not really because
1341.0,1391.61, we've already seen what we're doing can do and it is nasty leetel you no henchmen he is on and when he gets into the big leontion they will treat him a little bit and they will malamberti and i think he's just going to have a fancied you think he's informed because i meant you said he's on hitable but at this point he pietrasanta seven hits so he's obviously given up almost almost hidden in a man he still dominating forty two strike out till eleven walkover walk i would take that any day but are you so you're not worried are you worried for the sake of the wolf pack lastraeas onely callisto get there this season without getting hurt and then he's on to it the rose i mean the attack but i think he's wonderful and i idoine
1392.87,1403.19, to the most serious and most important topic of the day we got to be serious straparola were talking at barbara's hair to day
1403.25,1413.21, he absolutely i think this is a very important topic and measures man i i have thought about those long i thought about this hard at the unemotional
1413.78,1471.86, no workman has thing with the lanisterre and and his inward in the puritan but he cannot wear the bradnor and he can't i don't think you can play with the angry three thousand refroidissement be meatless got two rails come off the side of his head well annotation hero in an iron and that's just what i believe what he's got to do he beat on iron scorn record as high school he just said he i'm better now i am so my own book and in this is what i've been thinking about there's so many possibilities out there i was thinking about good looking her teleray and another and one direction has very now fair i know her style it he did the hairy styles that my look good did that would withstand the savage the van on hawk would be a nice book for him to test how
1471.86,1491.12, also to louis kind of locally for her going everywhere and to loiter on his habit he can also go with the meat and how a little bit of proof antoinette option if they make the championship i think him resistent little cooperating that legree i think it would be fantastic but
1491.15,1537.5, no in that and the reaction video don't know within his college a half politely let a proof out of the back end he looked like some kind of pokanoket the pocketing of offense i like that i mean not cookooburrah topic i like what he had in that reaction video i don't like these the brains but other thing is twitter page he is like an affording is awesome like atli the obstinate coal with that bacon he would look so intimate that resisted the israelites good have you ever seen roninhohonti
1537.92,1571.46, he was doing it everyone talking about it it's time for backlog james stars offered a night where we we have known brakeman malbourne season obviously have my little that right here some pretty and dubois but what will accords doing pool among everybody are department and honestly i'm just had hung from a roommate greg field as long as i can beat him at all matters and shaken his head behind the camera now but i conventionalised whatever
1571.46,1617.39, and like i know what it is i want to be in this unyambogi what i'm doing and then and we should also mention that we're not just only doing the store also doing men's in nineteen women's nineteen women into the bay and by within ten also tournament of stuff which is really cool the gasometer in slithering categories there's no musters food verses monumentalized then also sports figure and i was personally offended when we almerias a sixteen set esperance in the world right now and is a sixteen when his basilicae
1617.51,1623.84, about each man and you know number one deservedly mardan
1623.87,1646.82, the sea i mean i mean he was the best in bayreuth i was just i was just care about masses i mean michael jordan he can be at once set free on so i think i think a very intriguing and i now produce the given pievakin who was i to see in the food category to take it to the house is got in their fine
1646.85,1668.06, and i think very undervalued in the in the category is like breaking bad and watanabe to my favorite series the walking dead it even in the tournaments whittemore all of the mountain could walk they antemeridiana they were forefather in the night turn amidst
1668.15,1698.87, now we're going into the big finish all right young you're ready is there wrestling has noble members going to install tournament was the big deal that would excite me is woman's wear women's basketball and now we got rustling in the sea were doing big things of settler men's basketball turning i got the ashes over the ages and the fourth or centerport sorry five to thirteen gamesome upset i have the pall over due in the second round of the woman
