39.15,54.54, the problem you face if we look at the wild population going back to when humans appear for much containers ago population wasn't very big by the tommy reached around three the entire world population was a little bigger and five times out of birmingham
54.6,58.38, he of the black desk we'd got the houran population
58.41,61.59, much the same size as three londons
63.39,83.94, it was the first time the well population broken billion and it took well over a hundred years to stick another billion on having said that it took a little lesson forty years to stick another pennon and then only fourteen years and as you can see were walking through at an increment ray this is a staggering rate of population growth
85.92,104.37, people use stuff and you can mature stuff they use as dead which is the amount of money in this case per capita which the average global citizen has available to and passes to the anschar and you'll see that number has gone up colossally per capita
104.52,108.0, remember of course the population is going normously to
108.0,120.03, so laconic promise hundred billion in eighteen hundred modern day dollars four thousand billion nineteen fifty and ellwell over thirty six trillion even by nineteen fifty
121.59,124.68, those dollars is on the pine by things 
124.71,140.55, resources that are being used by the be gold or ten or mercury or lead or trees or air or water that's what's on the penning this massive growth and the impact therefore are enormous this is the class in seafood species
140.82,152.13, around the world you'll see they are plummeting the lantern trend of it follows that it is they won't be any edible sea from species left in the planet by the time you people a late middleaged
153.57,155.13, not just fish
155.16,164.28, to see those people with grain on the side of the left hand side of a wild grain production and consumption maiming creases it's got me
164.64,173.28, first lines and that means outside shed loftily i made all of which at these derived from fossil fuel by large
174.84,193.98, humans agreed we don't just like to gravelotte meat so if you look at world population in the orange bars which is what you see before you sit world meat consumption is rising much quicker the wild population is because as population grows and people get more affluent those people want to start eating meat
195.09,196.62, no small cattle
197.7,209.4, give water to the cattle and towards the crops needs a lot of water it takes around a thousand meters of war to the general by the time water the crops fed them to account the cows being drinking

279.18,290.34, at amorous mount of an economic industrial base seventy thousand new chemicals existence by the time your ten you've got thirty five thousand chemicals in your body that never ever existed on the planet naturally
290.55,300.18, new chemicals are created the worlds never seen before every year or producing all over four trillion tongues achings of topic was a year
301.44,308.94, destroyed in our ecosystem well using three species and hour of no index theses that was in the year two thousand
309.09,314.49, just for seconds let you read this malvicini two thousand and eight
322.98,330.57, the fastest mass extinction panic ever seen on the fort record probably than a ten thousand fold in your in the middle of it right now
330.93,336.06, this is not over millions of years this is over half my lifetime because i'm fifty
337.65,339.87, extinction before
341.97,348.84, happens there is when an easter is on the pressure you you got a tacit and its task collapsing so even the nineteen nineteen
348.87,352.89, historians were saying this is a massive mass extinction
353.01,356.1, ready and before other things are started to happen
356.4,360.96, the big pole which will cause a massive collapse will be climate change
361.11,377.37, it changes because the earth's abthanes from moralistic more spherical arsenical and there's a forty one thousand year tilt in access cycle for that there's twenty six thousand years cycles procession of the access which is like where top is
377.43,396.6, getting to come rest in stars spinning like this and you've got some spot cycles which some eight men we got to iges to all parts underhanded thousand years but if he starts taking greenhouse gases in like canarsie what they do as they let her away radiant in through and they trap long way region which is heat
396.84,399.84, more on the world will get hotter
399.96,403.32, it's because we're burning a lot of fossil fuel
403.65,410.79, feels laid down in the million year period right and you can be cold as positively
410.85,425.91, a gas i'll just nothing more than carbon stored and with burning and quickly if we go back to my great grandfather's time first oil well was drilled first mystic light barber hundred and four years ago no electric circuits to purity but a waste of time
426.57,439.08, more in road and little rounded years ago in america first meal jaicket love fifty years ago first home penitent three harwich tom i was already a tanager
439.29,449.55, last year that's what we were consuming more mental amount of energy goes into producing these things a monumental amount of energy goes into running these things
449.76,451.2, results of that
451.77,453.69, in this at the moment
453.96,457.77, second and that man is going of increasingly quickly
459.36,472.98, we burned since and billions of tons of sea to the blue area is the total amount of serratures a fifth of that will still be noospaper three thousand years time it doesn't go away once you get it out
473.31,477.81, down rain forests of explain which we form any be sequestering carbon
477.9,482.4, result around three point two billion tons of stones a year
482.55,493.98, the next three years popping down rain forest william calm dockside as every single aeroplane ticket ever sold since this the right brothers up to the acetous and twenty five this is a catastrophe
494.7,509.1, as going into an atmosphere which if you roll it up at standerton pressure would be that size from petworth your atmosphere is very small indeed and if you put a lot of stuff in to a small austere the concentration screams upwards i tramped
509.1,516.09, you can detect that even measure at a temperature from satellites you can also see what's happening for instance to ice caps
516.09,520.59, they start melting in this case between nineteen eighty and two thousand and three
521.55,524.34, to concentrations are rising fast
524.94,532.92, politicians and it means generally grown ups are doing absolutely nothing meaningful about this at all mister bache cato practical
533.49,536.76, he popped the mass things make a federate and since then

546.51,550.86, produce disease plague pestilence famine
550.86,554.04, or if we look at extreme weather events
554.7,562.2, united nations take resources you'll see they're going up because blooming produced extreme weather events tornadoes
562.2,564.09, and so forth
564.21,567.96, then just as the forest fires that we had last year
571.47,579.15, of course that was following on the same time from the front and pakistan and these figures they go belief that these are enormous impacts
579.24,582.96, fifth the pakistan and are under water from flooding
584.64,590.07, of that is that you can't grow the props upon which that big population depends
590.34,611.25, prices go up to prices go up poor people can't afford to buy grain they start starving when they start starving they stop fighting wars and that's really what the trick of the arab spring was this year was food prices and even the pentagon in two thousand and three were warning of the fact that there against be significant laws in your life time in your own back yard

638.58,639.69, a fact
639.69,653.79, no issue world wading dessault on control there's nothing about greenholm is what we're growing how we grow it where we grow it there's nothing at all at meat there is no world policy at all on greenhouse gas emissions
653.85,684.81, no action being taken on these things at all so the questions that i think you should come up with or so might think about or is it down to as individuals do residenters switch in my box out were jumping the winter and try to go vegetarian is the issue national should you be kicking the rear and at an your government and you'll meet some of the government advises the soft noon i hope shall be international should you will be getting together to say to us the will will not take this any more and you will do something in which case what's the answer is it political or is it economic

698.28,700.62, ventnor going to come up 
701.19,706.53, go to coasting that has that sort of scale of impact and that's just on the greenhouse gases
707.52,722.55, might be scientific could be that your not communicate it could be the usual pressing for nuclear power for wind barates for so a winter by an iron centrated soaper there's no national or intentional agreement about what should be done
722.91,728.85, might say keep burning fossil fuels are we going to store it estates is comin captain storage
729.03,730.26, the option
730.44,737.49, some people still go engineering spray particles into reflect more some light away from and on the gamins
738.75,756.21, you need to come up with smart as to all of those problems and each of those problems does not act on its own they're all integrated and just retreat adults or not implementing any situations to this and you guys and girls are going to be a dreadful trouble if you don't put some solutions on the table
