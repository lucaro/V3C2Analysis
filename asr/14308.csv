0.03,45.87, all right is it going on i'm great i you address good man ought to i'll do the inserting a perfect this christian art i'm here an electric forest i'm sitting here with iron from head found that order had coordination non partisan non profit that is the power of music to get folks involved with our democracy are biggest action which were doing ethereal
46.95,62.94, but i antinous based out again i'm sore beset of new york city but we have teams and we a volunteer team leaders and about cities across the country so are offices are new york but we have a foothold in pretty much every major american city
63.48,67.71, it all right so all right you came out from new york then it spread
67.8,72.9, has it been going so far at this year's electric forest from the perspective
73.11,155.55, it's awesome so it's a weird time if you're entering voters there aren't any major elections happening this year in terms on the national scale so there are a couple states new jersey and virginia both have governors raises a lot of cities have mayoralties not necessarily know that people might not be overestimated hundred people aristotle i will send you a londoner you go out and vote
156.06,161.58, be a tecmessa all that you can choose your mail so you can elect
161.61,212.91, as i read mails but missing i don't miss that aside i guess that might get me in trouble right now if i have responded certain people taxes that are laureate other big thing is we have artists take photos so we have artists take photos all the records and it says registered a vow on the clouding day in september national voter registration day we have all our art we have all our artist partners hareton social media to get well to register and we have unique in reach artists we can track which are teasing the most votes or which which fan bases registering the most antoinette
213.03,229.23, twenty thousand people is that so that across the country to crosscountry across the country i guess this is my third year at forest i had a probably he registered plates
229.41,240.45, so you mean over the theatre as you become your three years of yestereen is my first in time in the forest o
240.51,250.68, so it's i think it's i think it's a powerful thing to have movement in those ideas and the opportunity for somebody to there to take that first small step of
250.92,257.37, a actually registering you guys offering that here at music festivals specifically why is it that
257.73,304.23, that had come makes that extremes like this so the way i look at it is on the way you get people to vote the way you get people to do something they're not already doing is my framing in an entirely different way so we're nonpartisan we're not asking to register and then vote for somebody we just want you to vote for whoever you want to vote for so it's really antoinette there and people astigmatism good failing you get when you're frolicking through the forest and seeing your favorite man and then the first of the first robbery i remember it was it had a lot of
304.83,323.82, behind it there were breakout sessions with a like lectures and talks and stuff and it was one of the i remember i remember i think was one of the first feasible that really tried to split up even honorary going cyclist
323.88,325.53, this is a good place for that
325.68,460.35, beginning oh yeah i mean since were getting rather electric cars madison house which puts on electric forests are very big supporters of count so this like sometimes you show up to a festival and it's like you're not rapture not making any money you're not paying any theatre they gave it to enter they could make a lot of money they are leaving money on the table left and right to curate and create the experience that so much more than just music and it's you look at the voting work at the electric college group is doing to green the festival to settlement the music insanitation and will go beyond just dancing and just doing that and antenatal that registering it otherwise he is now you'll be able to tell your parents about at least one thing you did this weekend and it justnowland when i was a musical but i left i said i went to a lecture about feminism in the music world and i read seventeenth community there are a lot of fertile
462.42,467.61, awesome so it's kind of wood on the ground sort of thing it's
467.76,550.86, to people and asking where is it having got set up in turn walpole in so essentially if people are sitting if our volunteers are sitting at the bothersome thing that's going on were he a big sign a huge sky banner that says register a vote and that does bring people in but my goal when i'm in feasting person at that estrangement and these somebody they have no connection but the meeting one good reason why you don't want to register a vote i have not five hundred good reasons why you should register to vote i like a good reason would be i'm a violent anarchists actively working again not every good reason not neapolitan states and inconsistent
550.92,612.27, i mean there are so many things that people don't realize that this is something that gets voted on and i mean like i hate to like planetary about a festival but a lot of people don't realize that the states that it legalized cannabis for recreational use uniformly devoted electioneering from petition thing so it starts with a petition to get something on the ball and now michaelson the ballot the way you signed the petition as he had to be reservation out but not just to get it on the alternate
612.39,732.42, still speaking you don't own property you don't have kids in the school you're not dealing with your local government the way and established adult with so it's finding the string that you to what our government does and what our rules are and if you look around the country erecting for president actually is better spent doing anything else but from a spiritual levitation in jail and the judge you might give your friend a warning or might be and that if renown a government that dry or ties that priorities the arts versus a government that decides maybe we don't eat the program for children maybe we don't need this art camp may be leontes in the classroom and i mean i'm a music festival i wonder to be as much music in his many classrooms as possible like there's a awondering getting up there just crushing it and like people sometimes you just pick up a guitar but more often than hatchetman like i'm not going to like push any and specific political agenda but from a personal standpoint there was were reading a connected to a lot of issues that we don't necessarily think our politics because it loneliness to get have to talk about something that resulted will let me go notorieties write the laws that govern society
734.16,743.13, so have you ever lost that argument or how have you ever on that argument in the difficult way so if somebody says no
743.34,750.45, and doesn't want to i mean the first thing that all say often seems like how do
750.45,906.48, so i mean the real way that you switch is it's you know make it an argument you have to flip the script you don't say because if you go ahead to head it you've been on facetious people are on sasebo ever like oh you're right sorry so it's you flip the tripolitan to them and you hear why there beside and why they feel disenfranchised and separated from the system and then i try andalusian while like you can be connected whitening do matter in your life and my whole is these are things that they've never had i somebody might never have heard before they might not realize that you can literally vote on mariannakookas in a meeting and said this roadside thiers a forty five like if you like driving fast maybe you might want to run on that platform and solution an argument because it wholeheartedness be able to feel that strong belief in be headstrong and what they believe in in other ways and they might not register with me but the wheels are turning in their head there thinking about their government the king buttermere the view the world and i hope that that person without even realizing it concomitant change that i want them to make and it's because it's the easiest thing to do if somebody sees the banner shows up and says oh i'd been meaning to do this or my parents have been talking to do this that's really easy that feels creations not himportant angle from a different prismatical
906.51,960.75, they're all these things well we all agree on like so many issues so it's were focusing on this tiny sliver of things that we disagree on but at the end of the day i mean like there are still marks in this world and it's you look at what to people who would say in a classical liberal sensible living democracy is hotherwise that we should have the decision about how ostentation ilithuia we were governed our laws remain are day to day lives were controlled by the strongest most violent most though it individuals like the people who essentially would be able to put their foot on your neck and say this right now
960.78,977.91, perfect now but we're governed not by the most violent and the most fugitive the slices and the people who are most willing to waiontha far from perfect that's barbarous a whole a whole lot of stepmothers
978.75,983.04, democracy is better than the alternative because definitely man
984.27,993.48, you have a very thorough perspective of all this i really appreciate that it's great to hear what goes on behind
993.66,998.31, that everybody seen and really how the wheels of that all work how did you get into this
998.34,1000.17, so
1000.35,1090.98, i studied politics in college i was very much into amelie my whole life i've been patchin about politics at something that i don't know where it happened i think i was in my love of sports probably came slightly before and then i realized the graphic in the political section the ingrams and the newspaper looked slightly similar to the ones in sports and then from there i guess i just kind of jumped in and my parents are very intolerable every night about the son the worldliness good and clean there were aspects were you getting people to vote for candidates when you're when you want to be able for him they and there's nothing wrong with campaigning but it's your really pushing people and the canonisation you would call people until in bemoaning the are voting for talking about your candidate and that was like a really businesslike up an addition of politicians and many surrounding
1091.13,1147.59, countries in fish and somebody said there's this organization and there's this guy who runs it or founder here or confounders really both huge fish vans and huge political people and they were like talk to him he might know about a job somewhere and i'd seen had counted festivals i'd registered to vote with that town before i'd even volunteered on involved so i go in i have a meeting with one of the furniture to the music world we are in a set of new york not washington d c for a reason that he the music world is not where the political world is so i came in with my background hottentot 
1147.65,1154.49, master is a lot of overlap there between those those two worlds to you mentioned so i think that's a really cool fit
1155.78,1158.42, or had come
1159.38,1167.45, anything about had outmost people might not know about are there any other missions besides just like the boots on the ground kind of thing just people registered
1168.05,1295.46, the biggest public facing aspect and the people think the activation people know us for his vote registration but vote reiteration ties into our overall goal to be the organizing arm of the live music community to amplify and elevate other people's voices so vote induration is the simplest way to amplifie elevate another person's voice but we have this incredible experience going to fandangoes in a bunch of cords around the country where we take the knowledge and experience literature to a clear activation so it's not just learning about fenestration somebody can take at your both at a festival and then we and sent imisee to take that action when we do it at the festivals by having garashanin denominations all the members of the band with custom on this is something that we also auction to raise money for the other groups we table with two the action carwell probably go for upwards of fifty thousand dollars but somebody can get it for free just by taking the actions and i been to a lot of falstaff foods that don't necessarily have much activity that don't have people stopping by 
1295.49,1305.36, ripton remodel means that people want to stop in their excited to learn about what you do and let's say they're in groups and only need three camps on your card can flout three cards
1307.01,1312.29, an it seems like it's going well as the voting i mean i suppose
1314.81,1317.45, as the amount of voters gone up
1317.54,1328.73, the last few years what i what's different about this time now the soissons in the bill up to the election and we registered
1328.88,1442.16, meriton of people and because so many of the people who had turned before or did not vote democratically generation they were active but they were naturally voters i think a lot of it had to do with the two lovers brandy says or some people say there are two sides of the same coin but for people say that so we have seen that there is more people monotheistic young people were really excited to vote for bamangwato severely higher than generation and contentment by rumors when they were turning nineteen together on a likenesses were and how we can do things in a way obviously not identical to their being a draft to go to war but in a way where we had we are forced to be more aware when it comes to the issues that young people care about obviously like to say millennial and describe them analytically silly
1442.19,1510.23, issues that people care about that young people care about that i don't hear older people talk about are the environment obviously there are older people talk about the army but the environment is really close to home for young folks and college londonderry people want to hear politicians talk about their issues olderman every election i love her but i don't necessarily know if i want every aspect my life decided by my grandmother harpooneers an american association of young persons there is an american ingenuities of robbers going out there and going out but there isn't anything in the 
1510.29,1517.37, i said before young people don't own homes they don't have kids in school we have different connections or community than older people do
1518.81,1532.67, how do we get over those someone blocks and how we get people to vote that is make people think voting fun but like notting unlike what you're doing it's a change of perspective 
1532.7,1535.01, in different type of context
1535.31,1544.07, and holding away or finding a way to unlock any boundaries that usually go up when it comes to type of political conversation
1544.28,1546.59, entirely and like 
1546.68,1589.22, the most the most relieving feel like well they're two really relieving feelings i got to the second one a minute one of them is when somebody says who do you want me to vote for and i give the privilege of saying whoever you want to vote for and then of enumeration twenty states you can vote of outline
1589.22,1714.47, and there's this idea that felons can't vote and at music festivals i don't know if we live our daily eisenach people at felonies all the time but you just don't know but it is a etiologist think they're not able to vote when they really are and just like the able to restore some of the oriental franchessini sign of the election artlessness for years to come were hoping to do a very large activation next year honoring some more stuff to this festival this festival is so incredible the way that the interactive us and intractable other groups electrology i mentioned a cantonment on them it's just whitetail it isn't me it is in any of anyone in office we all could leave and had twould be fine causelessness of it had contracted
1714.8,1757.85, to what that great man a lot and i appreciate that i really preciate what you're doing i think it's i think it's a powerful thing is an important thing thank you so much you guys are going about in a great way had countered rapids office opening soon better where it were italian alcippe this week end about getting a getting a team at grandison you guys have some great music venus here some that you help help undefiled to volunteer
