0.99,17.16, well first of all thank you severe thank you mark and alfred i don't like to do this okay here we go ever the story begins in greece as and so is this one day and a curse were father and son and acres decided that he wanted to fly over to
17.16,50.25, his dad built him a series of wings as you see them represented in our history for a long period unfortunately he burnt off his wings because he flew too close to the sun the socapa project was something that we undertook as a group of the college of architecture international competition to build a solar powered house entirely solar powered twenty universities participated those were the competitions that we had to actually begin to compete with which my callisto a little bit about this could not have been built without an incredible amount of people here how many inches are 
50.43,71.79, and of course not beaming but we basically had to bring together people from ida mechanical engineering electrical engineering a building construction and of course a college of architecture at the very beginning or design process included a number of models and representant how what we were going to build her you can begin to see some of the wings on the solar skins
71.79,121.68, wings are both modeled in terms of small scale models and marsile models and obviously on terms of digital models the wings was an idea about how to use a fordable take to actually construct the architectural principle of the house and the skin had a lot to do with the ability to sort of understand the relationship of solar son and the sort of sensitivities of that which goes back to the story of creso course acres did crash his father knew that he was going to crash and that was because you can get too close to the sun and you don't want to get to close to the sun the students had to produce an incredible number of drawing to actually get this building built theoclymenus the wings and here they are in prototype mode and to understand the various qualities of skin like was an absolute generator for the whole project without the idea of life being a designed principle we would have never been able to get so far
121.68,143.97, and samples were built from very very sort of small scale to very large scale and of course the time come the time did come to actually start building and that all freaked isot right and here we were deliberately chastise had to be transported to washington and so of course we had to get it on wheels we have to get the wheels off we actually had to build the chassis is which actually pulled for eight thousand pounds of building this little thing right here
144.18,196.86, we had to insulate we had to actually get the structure built every single one of these pieces was welded and actually built by the students it is an unbelievable toward the force actually have erected the structure at that they did but for bold and a screw for screw once the structure was erected there is a melian the audience in nearer she is once a structure was erected actually had to begin to think about questions of envelope and the envelope is too to part one is structurally insulated panel which is a polysynthetic round dark and the other the other factor was this sort of sensitive skin which was a polychromatic that was infiltrating material that we then came to us in the roof skin that you see here here we have all of our actors wonderful sort of acrostics
196.89,209.58, in the audience the basically hung off that roof for days on end to get these panels and sir to which are again are sort of a plastic compound filled the arago and this was a sort of basic principle behind the kind of sensitivity of icarus
209.67,221.16, here we have an interior design again and built with a policarpio panels a constructed at the a p which is the advance with products we at the college of architecture in georgia tech it he having made that very clear already
221.22,230.73, and the interiors were sent machine and a design by this should do and loring and built by a whole number of students a milligan included
230.85,263.61, project would never have been possible without a whole series of buildings systems related information and data which my college which you care will be showing you in a minute and whether it was hot water whether it was the actual inverter whether it was the orbits or the heating and ventilating of the house the systems were essential we get to washington in october i think it was the end of september early october and we had to haul the house up there actually get it kind of finalized curious the roof we had never actually built the wings of the roof until he got to washington we don't like to do things you know
263.64,285.42, short notice anything like that we only had five square feet we had really really being a small amount of space to actually build everything i saw you some of the sort of final slides of the actual house when it was set up on the mall with some of the ideas about the skins again reappearing in all of these images it's a pretty nice sight to actually be out there on the washington bade
285.66,345.9, and so both the exterior and the interior finely seem by all of us for the first time we were actually building up until the opening day on saturday we had never seen these interiors which are absolutely spectacular and again in all of this was based on the idea of light and light as a generator whether it was the interior of the bathroom or the bedroom the furniture was all donated by herman miller and partly the kitchen by butterplate final figures but some elaborate forestalled of course even present caprice of our competitors and friends a university of texas austin called the winners tarentella other categories and we'll see some scores
345.93,347.25, in a minute
347.31,355.11, all of this really could have not have been possible without the ability for many of the students actually built skills while they're actually having a good time and freaking out at the same time
355.11,370.62, whether it's questions of well being or woodwork or actually literally building the steel you know and making sure that i actually allows for the structure to actually operate but even something assertions trying to load huge amounts of it you put trailers to get your materials up there
370.71,404.25, the same time you can't build anything like this which probably had about people in terms of just student work and maybe dozens of faculty members without actually building teens you build the building but you also have to build a team because otherwise we couldn't nathanael complete this i invite all of you to come and take a look at the house it is on campus and protocol age of architecture there it is in the process of being re configured and also to visit our sight at solar detected to thank you very much
