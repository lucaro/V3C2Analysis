0.06,6.9, through this side were gostering out key points with a slide and a treaty to move it along 
7.29,12.81, so we're going to start by talking about some tea
13.14,18.87, you see terminology and stuff like that but before we get into it
18.87,36.72, caution warning these terms are you need to take them with a grand salt they have people fight about what they mean they mean different things to different people on really need to read that in mind and ultimately it's going to be important to figure out what these terms mean to the actual individual people
36.72,44.85, whetting and so we're just going to walk through a little bit of terminology which is sort of a rough and ready
45.03,48.42, i intended to give you a hat on a habitant to be used but
48.45,51.51, but not to give you a sort of absolute definition of them
53.1,59.43, so when i talk about the chance under umbrella and one of the ways in which the word changed is used as a
59.43,61.5, a group together
61.56,64.2, groups of individuals
64.38,88.62, as far as commercial services perspective i don't think this is very useful but it's so much a part of sort of the procula that we thought we'd throw it in here and covered a little bit we just want folks to be aware that many people who are commonly referred to as being untethering ender umbrella may not identify that way at all and may not see themselves as part of any sort of transcend phenomena
88.65,89.64, all
90.99,96.21, a right to transact probably many people are familiar with that word it has its roots
96.45,101.04, in medical language it's often used to refer to individuals who
101.16,106.62, access medical technologies a various different sorts to transform their bodies in ways
106.68,109.08, or with their own gender identity
109.98,115.2, and also refer to individuals who self by deify as the gender affects
115.35,120.69, different from the one that they were signed at birth and who don't avail themselves of medical technologies
121.8,126.99, people who live for time in the role 
127.11,135.42, different from the one side of the marionettes transact very often what we see these days are folks identifying as
135.6,140.55, a chance manner than women are as transcendent woe women
142.29,148.77, the next category intersects individuals intersect generally first individuals who are born with
149.67,151.95, to put a crudely
152.07,157.35, a mixture of different sex characteristics that are that both male or female or
157.41,165.9, is that are somewhere in between whether not intersect individuals ought to be included under the transcendental
165.93,173.34, sort of an important issue because it's independent how the actual individual themselves identifies
173.34,184.86, if you think about the simple have you know actually separate the eye from the tea so desperate as the issue i keep saying a lot of this really depends on the person self identification
185.55,212.67, requenes and kings generally prefers to people who in the context of performance and might not be as relevant with regard to a providing services decline to things like that queens were pulling out a little bit because in some cultures in some communities queen is used by people who marinated in some communities queen is used
213.18,218.64, as a lure and some people take it as a slur so really
218.64,227.25, for the language that the person with whom your speaking is using and and find out what they mean by that news that language but in general 
227.31,230.07, queen might be a word that's contested
231.12,234.93, so gentler gender queer of an extension of
235.08,245.91, the word queer and so it has a combat of a resistant character to it were individuals who identify this way may be saying we don't want to get into any category one to resist
246.12,248.94, the attempt to sort of normalize us
249.03,256.17, and so i mean the lot of like you know attempts to mess with peoples traditional sense of have denderah to be
256.74,263.4, the next the next one if i forecast we do the side out i say some some with individuals because some
263.4,265.59, people don't identify as women
265.59,274.05, and many buts individuals don't identify as transport some do and so the war we're talking about here are individuals
274.11,279.48, siebert now identify as butch
279.54,283.17, very different reasons and often missus concha
283.26,287.1, behavior that some individuals we call masculine 
287.25,304.2, we might we also want to put out that whether or not i but first my identify his trends they may or may not use malaspina and may or may not use masculine pronouns and the mayor may not maydenis trans in the may or may not actuality is both
304.38,306.66, it's a very sort of
307.35,308.97, category
309.75,315.84, in surprise i guess great crudely replaces the word tonatiuh
315.87,327.42, he is not considered derogatory word cross canters gently we thinking of an individual fatima who present at these sometimes as women
327.57,383.07, it's important to a couple of misconceptions often it assumed the protesters are all heterosexual but there are by sexual prostrates and are also gay cross dresses also i think that self identification can be very important in the case of progressing so cross as from identified having to solve both a masculine in anathema senile and in this one were looking at sort of l b and t and disturbances been and trams some issues which might come up oh but before we even got started with that we wanted just hop for a second about sexual orientation and generality desolator this part to its traditional people sort of like you know many people who were a little bit familiar with transitory know this but is worth underlying before regan point to its complexity when we delaguerra with issues of sexual affection orientation
383.1,385.05, talk about chance issues
385.05,394.62, we generally dealing with tender identification issues and tender expression issues so this is separation between sexual affectional orientation in gender identity and tender expression
395.13,410.34, so the two things that we want to put this ledge really high light as things that might come up as issues around centers or grogram incorporating trans is that
410.37,412.86, some trans guise some chance
412.86,418.32, may identify as straight as heterosexual
418.53,446.28, they may continue to hang out and was being community that make continue to date eleben community and they may not under maybe issues around that there may be issues around being included or excluded from was being community and that some some tensions may arise in those two communities coming together and so that another point is that there are cases in which you may have a chance of any hint transitions later on in life what this means is that
446.43,473.73, prior to a transition she may be in a relationship that was you know viewed as a result relationship and then after a transition in this relationship becomes over the formosan relationship the maybe issues around access to a connection to and support from lesbian communities in culture because this relationship these books method from that and how they identify with regard to his relationship 
473.73,476.37, identity as may be
476.94,481.29, maybe negotiated it is incredibly by the couple
482.07,492.18, next line we got a look at gay and transcend i think the main things that we want to point out on this one is that
493.83,495.81, some day men
496.32,513.84, may identified trans women as drainesville manned or some people negation in particular sort of like the the assimilation is sort of garment like capital g capital a community
513.93,517.98, see trans women is giving the movement a bad public image ready like
518.25,527.01, as opposed to like they were just like you sort of movement verses like those crazy trainer you know wearing nothing when they go and get bridle
527.4,529.71, maybe those sort of issues as well
530.85,533.1, and so
533.67,550.71, you may have this going to be tension in the other direction i think that you know there's a lot of you know tranchee very cautious about being in gay malevolent particularly worried about being taken for you know being really really mantinean
550.71,557.16, so to resist that chance for the representation may really be interested avoiding that kind of environment
559.47,570.18, and this just has to do with by sexual and transcend and we didn't have a whole lot that we wanted to say about this except to consider this
571.56,587.31, you're doing in particular health related work if you were your staff are looking at sexual interactions between trans women and their non transmit partners to be gay as an resume
587.49,603.18, sexual behavior ally by sexual anything like that that may go against that woman's a devil so densely entity then you may not be able to to actually provide conserves to that woman or to her partner and a something really consider
603.72,611.07, when working with this population especially if you get to health stuff next wide
611.85,617.55, quickly to points on this and sort of sort of reiterate even now we separate
617.79,624.36, as referring to sexual affection indentations and tantrims involving
624.42,626.31, identity and expression
626.4,634.98, important to obviously bear in mind the chance to have sexual affectional rotations and what are sexual affectional mentation
635.1,638.52, come in all the different variations that you would find
638.52,640.08, not a people
640.26,644.1, alcibiades
644.1,655.62, titian gender expressions and you know it you can find artesian all albolene genders in ways that follow provence sociorum
656.49,659.19, and so the next slide
659.19,668.34, trask don't live their lives alone so what we want to say to that is that you know in the context of again was the improving
668.43,681.36, we have our client you know we have the people were targeting and their social milieu they had their lovers their friends their partners who also oftentimes identify also escalating for transpose
681.42,700.53, that may not be the case transpire have friends families and lovers just like a chance with those people may not identify his trans as lesbian gate or by canal and the may be real tensions there dematerialising at whether
700.53,712.02, chief together that something that that may have to be considered and the converse you know gib non trans people may not want to see
712.5,727.32, sexual people at their game and saying and so there may be tensions that develop when we're trying to serve not whole person at a whole community if this could be called one community lobes we'll go to the next life
728.1,730.89, a couple of quick points about health programming
731.01,734.1, one of the things that happens of course is that
734.31,737.85, chance woman often disappeared into the category
737.94,741.66, manxmen because a sort of
741.75,745.17, chance all the representations of chance women
748.05,761.88, i do helgramite because i think most of us who work with the trans population are founded in that way so when i made a couple of points one transcendere who have sex with man transformed
762.09,776.64, there's never any information directed toward that category with regard to like have prevention is to deeper vention you know anything like that also tension to women who have sex with trains and non chance women
777.78,782.91, also overlooked or sort of some into the larger and miseries
783.45,788.88, i hope everybody is baconian of sex if men manumitted women
788.94,793.86, so we just want to point out you know what about the partners of trans people
794.55,796.38, do we actually include
796.5,805.02, actual liberalities of chance folk in their partners in health program which leads us to next question on the next line
805.23,809.34, the being and are answer to that is may be
809.85,815.67, and then we're going to sort of look at some of the ways in which they could be really good alliance
820.38,829.2, one of the things that you can do when having some tea with you is make sure that you bring on transport not just as thine thine for higher
829.23,836.34, chance vote can do lots of different things and if if you're just giving chance folk the task of
836.43,838.92, chance pacific programming
840.66,843.48, something i think that agnolo at
843.57,848.7, yes so we were if we're saying gabet were ontitarac
848.88,855.6, make sure that there's some tea there make sure that you have chantepleurs in your
856.08,861.24, literature in your flutters and brothers in your staffing
861.36,862.92, now stuff like that
863.28,864.96, next 
865.47,868.44, here's some ways in which you can actually do that
869.55,878.58, the thing that we want to point out the most on this one is all levels of training if you're going to make sure that folks are culturally competent
878.7,897.36, to make sure every one is called to competent by your agency that included security for genial folk reception because you can do you can do sort of like you know the tetrachordon for the service provided themselves but if the chances on comes in and their treated poorly by you know
897.36,910.14, at the front desk you know pressing the phone you know security or something like that who you know gets the proneness monopoly that's going to be the person is going to leave
910.29,917.73, and all of the efforts to you know really i put on a good good chance program and to train the topic
917.88,919.11, been in vain
919.8,925.98, and there is such a need for transference services that if your agency is
926.28,928.68, truly so defend issues
928.98,933.9, will come they will cause the ninevites
936.21,947.76, this is my favorite slide because i think that it sort of underlies it of cities of political issue that if your wondering how we can include them
949.41,954.21, there are a lot of issues need to be thought about namely 
955.5,958.65, the goal is to sort of bring them in
959.61,970.2, so long as so long as they remained them they don't become we things aren't going to change the needs to be sort of a whole by reformation of what's going on
971.64,974.04, we then become in
974.19,979.95, when i had a little bit about how that kind of transformation might look in a couple of sides from now
983.61,988.95, so what we want to say on this slide had include the tea is that
989.07,1007.22, and i wanted just prefaces misbecome from a angeles perspective was angeles has a vocal trans community and also become from the social services perspective so rightness so agencies
1007.22,1013.1, just to nod with transitions and they make no effort to what happens is that may be you know
1013.22,1022.25, transporting comes and gets turned away or as treated poorly won't get around in the community and people stop trying to access he rises at that program
1022.28,1049.67, providers who didn't want to make an effort to begin with and then fall back on sort of like won't no chance people ever try to come near so we don't have to do anything and we want to say that that's not okay if chapel aren't access in your services the reason isn't that they don't need them there's been enough need to sentences the country to realize that any social services that are available chance people need just like nonsense need them and his chameleon coming to
1049.79,1056.33, particular agency chances or because that agency is not welcoming our acceptance
1056.57,1058.25, word has gotten around
1059.96,1061.22, next let
1065.45,1071.57, so i let antisocial a bit about this but i think that this is a classic example of
1071.81,1074.57, how you move away from the wet the model
1074.72,1076.4, i think that sort of
1077.09,1082.16, put it in the sort of funny way it's not about bringing them into the weed but it's often about the we
1082.49,1084.29, joining down
1085.34,1091.04, i think it's really important way before we decide to start
1091.19,1105.41, programming or to apply for a grant to help trans people anything like that that we that we become involved with the community as allies in his advocates even if we have no transition our staff
1105.62,1110.57, these are things that we still need to do whether we go out and get ourselves trained
1110.6,1114.47, we go out and participate in it community then
1114.47,1119.33, even if there are no community transfer community events in your area
1119.36,1129.35, for them in that case you know really be out there as a really visible and of voice on behalf of the trip and with the trans community
1129.74,1131.51, on the next line
1131.75,1143.48, just a side if the only person at your agency in all translates hands and if you only transporter and their only job is translated this is token is
1143.51,1145.01, and
1145.07,1146.6, not going to help
1146.87,1150.08, the one person who needed the job
1151.52,1153.8, those
1154.94,1158.72, of the thing we want to say about this is that you can
1159.17,1163.13, you're not true you can speak out on behalf of trans people
1163.13,1173.9, what you want to make sure that you're doing is to speak with the community and make sure that your lot appropriating the community voice and make sure that you're not monopolizing the megaphone right
1173.99,1176.39, we will use
1176.45,1177.74, privilege
1177.92,1191.9, to make space so that people who don't necessarily have access to media or to other people's ears that we as not translate can get them there so they can speak for themselves right that's a way that we can be in solidarity with folks
1192.2,1206.99, the last point really quick is even if you have no transalpine programs you can be a community ally you can be ready strong ally but think about why you have no transact or programs and the monmouth next lad
1208.52,1211.37, this is about agency issues
1211.61,1213.41, the basis
1213.5,1218.12, if i an agency is requiring transome to use
1218.21,1224.21, bathroom and transmits the woman's pains obviously a problem that should not be happening
1225.47,1233.78, hannibal entrancement reduce the men's room but i will also say that because a canoe 
1233.93,1249.56, sometimes you know being read by society in different ways and you know sometimes our presentations are in between you know ideally a gender neutral single so bathroom would be great if it could also be available
1249.95,1251.51, take care of these cases
1252.2,1274.94, but that said if you if there is if the multiple choices for someone in a chance in your person is being forced to use a separate bathroom that out temoignages that it is not appropriate and if you can see the lies the little lagoon the bottom people in search of safe restroom go to that website because it gives a wisdom gender mutual bathrooms
1275.09,1278.3, but the country so it's interesting
1279.44,1281.18, the next slide
1281.57,1283.91, this was to do more with
1284.15,1289.19, once you have a client who would to a wood of the person who is a client
1291.23,1294.14, so it's important to balance
1294.29,1302.78, safety guess the point were on bring up here though is that being uncomfortable with a transfusion
1302.78,1308.9, count the safety as she and so i stop replanting uncomfortable with the presence of the transfers
1308.93,1314.45, that's not that that's not a problem or falter responsibility of the chance person
1315.02,1325.91, and likewise if if clients are staffer unfamiliar we transitions that also not the responsibility of the transference king services to educate them
1328.73,1332.84, death said sam
1333.83,1345.59, so tis like i just want to start this with the story as a story that happened a couple of years ago to me an tellin of never got no for it so obduracy is it
1345.98,1360.59, it leads into this very nicely so we were asked to speak at a human sexuality class at a university in southern california and chillicothe feel about which is going to tell you about
1360.74,1370.58, how inappropriate is to ask about people's genitalia either you artistically or in any other kind of way and its sexual abuse babyland to talk
1370.82,1380.9, we asked for questions and among the audience raised a hand in front of hundreds of people and asked if i would please describe my vagina comparative alias
1382.34,1385.85, the whole room got completely silent i didn't know what to say
1386.3,1393.14, still i can't even explain the feeling that i get when i think about it because it was so like shocked
1393.35,1396.41, mortified and angry all at once
1396.41,1399.53, and it made me realize that you know
1400.07,1403.19, every time i probably ask a trans person
1403.25,1412.16, manisty if they've had the surgery that's the way they feel and i was able to really sort of put myself into somebody else's shoes and in
1412.19,1414.2, i think is a really real way
1414.47,1416.93, and so i asked the 
1417.68,1422.72, to do that especially for this cause sometimes for non transport these questions seem like nothing
1422.84,1424.88, i don't think they necessarily are
1425.24,1430.55, is this a lot i mean you see people you know asking tradesfolk
1430.79,1432.68, having had the surgery
1432.77,1442.94, or are you you know on a hamamama oh are you really a manner are you really a woman and these are very often used as coded ways of asking about
1443.84,1445.67, between the persons 
1445.73,1449.72, the fact is for some reason there is this kind of curtiosity
1449.72,1452.54, about the genitalia chance
1452.57,1486.17, the point is it's certainly not professional is certainly not going to be helpful and to terms of providing services and in my view it's actually abusive sachsen regardless of how you ask it i mean certainly if you ask someone you know sort of folly you know deepens remaineth wouldn't do that under normal messieurs is train which he apparently is acceptable but people often asked as to the coat in ways like how do you have the surrender
1486.29,1493.22, nathan and it's just wrong and i think that it is important also to bear in mind that this is
1493.28,1502.97, continuum of transpolar i mean at its most extreme you have in fact chance people being subject to force jeliagin
1503.03,1508.22, this i happened to manpower who are ultimately killed
1508.37,1514.25, this happened a generator example and bandanna where they were they were
1514.67,1518.93, they were forced to expose the genitals
1520.76,1522.47, this is not acceptable
1524.6,1533.51, on this we pull these out into separate bulletins because we just want to make sure that though they build on each other then not all the same thing
1533.84,1537.11, you have a quiet in front of you or person in front of you
1537.2,1547.94, regardless of what's on the right identification card asked them what name they go by and the name that they tell you is the name that you and everybody at your agency uses
1548.0,1550.73, all times when you're talking to the client
1550.88,1554.51, talking about the client with the clans there were not
1554.75,1561.2, may not name to use you also find out what pronounced they prefer and you ask the person
1561.35,1573.35, and i'm sorry and you ensure that everybody at the agency uses those pronounce at all times whether talking to the person or whether it's a talking about that person whether that person is there or not
1573.44,1583.13, so and so you know their name and what proofer that doesn't go too far in many cases with asking them to self identify their gender
1583.34,1586.37, this has to be an open ended question because
1586.49,1613.34, many trains people and i think for many people in general there's way more than just two answers to that question a oorouwela through the important point as you know i've seen it where a social service provides will be you know the therese the self identification of a chance person to their face so they'll try their best at the corners right but behind the back of the trans person they'll be using different pronouns or different names
1614.45,1623.51, and why you might ask is that problematic well is symptomatic of sort of a deeper deepole i think that it's important for service providers
1623.54,1628.22, eternalize how deeply important it is to respect the chance persons
1628.28,1635.06, identity happened eternalized that then just as are this is going to show up in the kind of services you providing
1635.09,1643.94, sonia three answers and this is given you included there's been some sort of transition going on but one does that transition actually mean
1644.87,1648.59, people think that transition concerns
1648.65,1649.76, series
1649.82,1653.75, and this last of different kinds of surgery the deserter
1655.25,1664.1, more relevant questions if we're going to talk about yet first of all transition may not include any medical intervention you may have a person who considers whose
1664.19,1673.34, himself to be a different gender than the one under whose had no interest or desire and surgery who has no interest or desire in hormones
1673.43,1678.59, for some other reason just as access in those interventions right now there are other
1678.71,1690.17, questions related to transition that can be a lot more useful and fruitful in providing conserves which are listed on the slide and move on to 
1690.17,1691.88, the next is
1694.16,1705.59, letitia so on we are so as you know when the appropriate when it comes up we are to ask people to self identify their sexual or affectional orientation
1705.92,1711.02, most importantly when ye to find out if a client as a gay
1711.08,1713.51, quinces and heterosexual
1713.57,1718.73, soerine questions discussion in other words find out
1719.27,1725.09, those words mean the same thing to them as they mean to you are you guys talking about the same thing
1727.07,1733.46, then make sure that you do want up talking about the same thing listen closely to what the client is saying in the language that they're using
1734.0,1740.84, location when you don't understand or you need clarification and use the language of the clan is using
1740.99,1747.29, they will make it much easier to me to continue this discussion
1748.7,1802.16, to the point what one of the points i want to make here is that the general thought that you know helping a person come out in terms of the sexual affection orientation is a good thing i think that this the mistake is to treat coming out of transatlantica thing as coming out in terms of repeal affection orientation and the different unexampled this is that the different kinds of coming out for transformed the is the first coming out were maybe you'll come out and you'll let people know that you're going to transition or you haven't transition yet in the process of transition and the missioning out where you are you already transitioned or your transitional you let people know that your chance and their different man and we want to say that no stop person has the right to insist that a clime comet any one this has to do with respecting a person self identification for example
1804.62,1815.75, i mean i was satiated they coming out as if a person whom you identify as being trans doesn't identify his trans
1815.78,1817.22, maybe
1817.22,1827.72, said jenny is or just a genial the they don't necessarily feel there's a need to come out if they transition many years ago as another example
1827.72,1839.39, maybe at one time they saw themselves during transition as being trams and now of motion that i don't feel that thence that's relevant information you may have political
1840.41,1853.31, reasons for wanting them to regeneration and may be good reason whatever but it's really up to the client to determine and the last thing to say about coming out as transit that some tons is it's impossible
1853.82,1858.41, it just can't be done sometimes a trans woman may say
1858.56,1860.24, and woman
1860.69,1868.13, no matter how she says or how many times she says if the person to whom she is speaking here oh he's really a man
1868.52,1871.76, the situation like that she can't come out
1872.06,1875.42, she can't she can never be understood in which case
1875.48,1882.98, even the attempt is putting her is subjecting her to sort of transport violence and
1883.16,1884.54, violence
1885.11,1888.05, okay 
1889.13,1894.23, so we just wanted to bring out some transpacific issues the serbo sometimes
1894.38,1916.76, think about if the non chance quick points one if you're a chance person and you know you've lived in a world that is invalidated your gendrin and may be the case that you of take gender behaves to kind of prove that you are you know really a woman or really a man and sometimes and sometimes these behaviors interferes
1916.82,1918.05, be harmful
1918.23,1925.43, so for example you know you might be a chance to lay you might end up saying in an abusive relationship with the man because you think
1925.49,1928.22, by doing so you really prove your womanhood
1929.84,1933.65, also it's important to recognize that
1934.07,1940.73, you know that people are read by other people in different ways in different situations and often how were read
1940.73,1952.25, changes so you can you know depending upon your presentation you can go through the day and be read you know one way in one place on my way another place or you can find that a person
1952.49,1963.71, read you one way and then as he went rock with him the red you another and it sort of created the situation in which you may see it till very vulnerable and vigilant on a kind of daily basis
1964.97,1970.49, we can come back to smoking i think to with discussion
1973.61,1993.86, so the one thing more will say about smoking is with regard to smoking cessation and the big smoking cessation program that i have seen hearing in los angeles is the last rag and the monuments to that is although it's it's a great play of words is very funny and you know the advertising is very sick and everything
1993.92,1997.25, might not resonate what chance people because
1997.67,2002.53, the idea of dread may sort of
2002.62,2021.73, so that's our joint may it may be me antiently with the use of the term the word drag so considering the last rag to be annette a cessation program may be a widower with
2021.82,2023.8, okay so
2026.41,2039.46, that's a man i am that remained thing that we want to say right now with regard to that oh if you'd come this far and you've done all this stuff then you regency probably is
2039.94,2048.88, friendly if you follow our simple steps are advice to you is to accept criticism and suggestions from the community
2048.91,2054.64, gratitude and that defensiveness as it says on the slide if people are criticizing your program
2054.88,2068.83, people haven't just walked away that means there's some community body in their soonest men in the program be successful and to that end we would really say you know what i can take the take what they're saying because it's going to improve your program
2069.01,2071.44, so
2071.8,2084.82, we have a couple of things on the next line wages resource suggestions things you might want to consider in treatment planning with documents people need a winestead in name of gender change on the identification
2084.94,2094.51, to think about some medical issues that may be really fraught for trans people especially with regard to lie prostrate
2094.6,2109.33, very cancer screening and just general medical care because for many trans people it is very it's very overwhelming and scary not to mention difficult to find a transcription
2109.6,2128.35, a final slide before we open for discussion is just our contact information and if if anybody is interested i would let to people who are doing a lot of work if any one's interested in working on the learning transport with us please let us know because we would love to get many more voices
