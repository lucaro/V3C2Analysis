66.15,70.08, actually we don't seem to have the other guests
71.34,80.61, you remember i was saying that what i find so interesting about these two pictures is the sense of the kind of sincerity and the attempt to really do the original know
80.73,96.36, work of alex ramon better than certainly better than me and maybe better than anyone here you did you know i let randall no no i know william and of hootooala a tank now i know i'll williamson who

132.24,138.18, my films that influence most of the illustrators that from my generation
138.21,147.12, along with the comic strips and these sunday comic strips primarily of which alex ramon was the best grass
149.28,164.64, i can't tell you how much you know you know it's very hard to explain how ironic that is for a forty four within i first wrote about mary page i tried to explain that too
165.0,196.65, every fifth grade to day has seen more naked women than the entire male population of the nineteen forty so it was not antithesis a belly button was a big thing to even in those days a time with brush them out but anyway it was in it still godinot only you know rampson erratic but it's very central in his line as the drawings of the recent
196.77,255.84, the way we loved it and go ahead or is going to say that to me if i don't know the conference as well as you do but i'm a big fan of prince valori she probably know existentially well drawn there are there different usual raiment to me as sort of like the berenicia the way the bodies moved away their shape the way they twist and space is it there's nothing else like it and i detstein do you think is this where these films come from is no year a matter adding encomiastic is that and he drew his women make an impulse on it you know that came from the custom litanies exactly the same thing from naked and gualtier people but then he repents you can always see the female figure and he did some pins for squire
255.93,263.07, about three or four periods of art the first stuff he showed in the review was 
263.55,282.03, early very very primitive and then it gets into a very wet we call a pulp anwoth lots of lines lots of movement not floored moment foreordinated pluscarden away drew it and he kept changing his periods and
282.3,283.95, he
284.16,287.28, and up in the ice as with three
287.37,294.33, is probably his epitome of that period queen free
294.78,300.54, then he went to war and then he came back and the comic of cold grip curb and with his
301.17,307.17, back prince baron grip cavendish tried to do a
307.23,312.93, adventure story with the detective coppery
312.99,320.13, melton cannot said he the reader i realized that after world war two you couldn't do that any more
320.22,324.75, in fact nobody did until present came along in the sixties
325.32,339.36, nor can a halfhearted couldn't get that sense of romantic adventure and that night amittai there it is you know it
339.54,354.36, doctor now that's how garner wooden tarzan after foster alastair riding treasury radicals look like a fetish
354.45,358.68, and i but for all iolantha experiment
361.56,366.09, one more as a film maker because you've really done all this stuff
367.2,379.89, you probably saw this picture on it came out i saw i saw one serial i worked on saturdays i couldn't go to the saturday matinee and i saw one serial with had declaimed
380.01,406.05, and i didn't find out what happened till about when i was on television really bad sixty mile made o prince i stayed home sick from my job at embattlements the black and white of a great you see the connection between the two oh yeah yeah and they tried the story
407.1,423.93, i could of the second film tries too much for me at prisonnier years of flash gordon into one movie and it over to the first one stick was really the first story of the comic strips
424.5,427.86, i miss the
428.16,436.11, it's really a high school romance said annexation if its high adventure
436.26,443.01, crisostomo gesture
444.36,451.41, and it's a formula that fastens explained to me
451.53,453.66, i was questioning him about
453.87,457.86, one which is full of this exotic world
457.95,461.67, and saying how can you come up with these 
462.09,489.78, grotesque monsters like the mad molino forth in the snake pits over and he we were sitting on the brown derby and every hill at the time and he said can look around you and we are submarines all those hollywood marcus there into the night that elegance is satory take it from right to left but then he said but there is a form of as that into that exotic
489.78,493.05, bertha a domestic problem
493.23,505.89, guineas fact that one of the sergeants wants to quit and meridian i would lay bare from front page accentuate who rode the prescript for gungadi
506.04,516.36, and pluscarden is essentially that we got high adventure and flash goes into a new world whether it's the witch queen who
516.75,524.61, intoxicates him so he can't remember anything or under who lives under water who keeps him under what had they take her
524.61,529.2, away from dale who gets very jealous with you for
529.53,536.76, high school romance free agathemer the ice world or the after him for years
536.97,552.0, the last makes it work for me when they first always and first did it they left that out and like a very upset at ahead i thought much witless
552.39,571.05, i know you all i know what's interesting to me about the way you work as a costume designer is the work so much you start you are started my opinion with the silo you you're always finding the right body shape and creating it with so overbalances in or something and these and that's really sort of a cartoonist is because they create solitary
571.05,575.85, the classical the colette don't bother to florestan so
575.91,581.46, how does he think that relates you know all this material what do you think of these pictures in a sense
581.49,600.09, how that creates the contents of various sculptural and when i was watching this at home to go together distracted by the collar and so i watched it with the color of it was black and white and then you could rely see the silhouette the shapes of the shoulders and the girls but
600.09,603.27, it's a very graphic and you should
603.66,609.39, you was to do one day look at it in black and white continually fascinating to 
609.45,612.42, esprit good on the big screen
612.54,618.6, each one of these in one of these cases in the must be like without costumes in the movie
618.6,620.73, one would take a month
621.27,624.18, maybe people love to make
624.27,644.43, i suspect and do not know not who did the costume of the container and no flies casimir i am sure he is the lot of conduct and china and india and i bet all that beadwork and there was miles would be for it was in india negotiation couldn't do it it is in england 
645.12,648.75, maybe some suspect in china and india is
648.81,660.63, just the volume of work in one of mascotte whole caller was all he babilonius alike five thousand but let in it and each one as he put on by hand
661.17,667.92, interference of those cases be the museum i mean the gorgeous
668.43,673.02, and so i atwater atoning was behind them
673.02,677.46, the designing for a musical roora
678.0,688.11, there was a more music in this movie because you wouldn't design that and make that a bobbed you can do it in medley can do it saltier
688.2,693.66, i was to create the look the bulbs which like the hardest way to create that look
693.93,695.55, the member
695.79,700.77, beginning the thought that more music and then they were going for a rock over look
701.34,705.24, it was interlacement of work to do with that way
705.78,716.94, interesting as this sense that events well and there are so many people and so many offices and its almost like that do you consider that part of the set
717.3,723.12, ye think about it with smiles of women every one in a different costume and their covering
723.18,735.45, you know what i mean all you really left with us the ceilings in the war i don't know when i've seen a movie with such a laborious i mean and the work in the just even extra
735.63,745.38, just fantastic and there's a lot of bellini designs in it like the people in the background there was one thing that this continue to noon as always when they would it would have an elaborate
745.38,752.79, dress and then the table long kind of veil over the whole thing and they had that in several of the background characters as
752.97,755.85, gorgeous but the right out of the sky defiles
755.85,758.97, i think not must have done some scanty films
759.84,769.86, he was godfather work was the lootenant an deep roy he turns up in chichesters of encroachment
770.01,779.37, and then an interesting side not is that federal conflagrashun in italy
779.91,819.87, he roared at that anaitis called by leclair and wisely said you couldn't use the american comic strips so they re created them and that you know well quite quite shakes about that kind of way headline rode pluscardensis the andastes
819.93,822.36, so
822.36,834.81, you think then what do you think the customs do to the story and create for the mean weltered to the other molecule costumes the other over a inexpensive process but they are very waiters picture
835.2,838.95, well i happen to like that look of the early
838.95,843.36, ah the decking and you know we told what about strike
843.36,856.14, a loose version of russian construction is which i really like like a leach was in the beginning of the real that regime is very graphic and very simple and very russian locking
856.17,859.95, his style that i really like but you don't see in movies very often
860.19,868.05, not that they really do that in the early flush gordon but there is a little bit of that and because it's in black and white that helps a great deal
868.17,878.16, and it controls it and they probably were not shot it passes probably in color so i be curious to know what colours they were wearing
878.37,883.2, that really high contrasted look at these red or black or
883.47,892.41, because you can't run if you can't really use black and white and gray you have to use specific colors at photograph really well for black and white i now did a commercial one and
892.47,894.15, black and white and it was
894.24,898.59, twas very tricky you probably know a lot of better to get it to look black and white
898.98,906.03, armitage the blacks really rich and black and white white town
906.3,912.45, bring back the life alooking at the early show is that
912.51,915.54, unembarrassed the actors were
915.54,922.92, were they the guide who was the scientist had his life little like jonson big star
922.95,934.35, i tried to put an actor in that to day they would ascribing an the turbaries like skinny legs but these essenes you know
934.47,940.29, they just proudly self and the foaming about that and being gifted with do that to
940.68,943.83, i have to say that for me a part of the whole essay
943.86,945.3, of these films
945.3,948.78, do really have not to do with the design but the acting
949.11,973.98, incredible in the sense that they take it seriously and they never win you know and there is some stuff in there you know the second follows written by lorenzo simple was a guy famous for writing you know denoting can and wring the tabitha if you see an interview with him and it is on the deversified by it discomposed this football game and you get these kind of jokes that are the to me they're awful
974.04,997.17, all recoiling me but the actors i mean what's his name titian is clearly going morality with complete conviction than you imagine i'm sure they are actors in the house how you play that scene or he he suddenly becomes pleases friend and he says i'll folly when i mean and makes it work eating
997.53,1001.52, to a certain extent it's true of the actors in the first stall as well
1001.67,1009.89, body and they're good at actors but they are so sincere and with a sort of morbid thing was at from the comic
1010.76,1033.17, look at it from that year he deepens the drainage is that his world is greatly comelinesse trees not nearly as complex as this junction for me though i saw in the first film
1033.47,1050.3, from sign of the cross oh really lots of the roman helmets and then from she the marian cooper she particularly the priest is cottiswoode and and that lame
1050.96,1063.59, shaw from the helmet that yet out of simferopol have made a man just for that foul wifehood have done it now they had a use everything that hollywood had
1063.68,1102.98, it's so funny because i had a long list of films aheera biblical films that i wanted to and i was already nearly killing denis as it was i couldn't lamartiniere is so much of that you know the ring the gladiator stuff you know it's the same joy always the woman of sin across and just imagine now you can create on indoors but seems to me that something like for instance or a home which is very distinct he has exactly from the common booklet tried ticketed disclose to the comic it is not as naked though as the comic right they got in his shetland some of them and there's no whipping
1103.34,1110.39, very big weapon whipping in the comic the ramon was big on whipping 
1110.57,1116.42, i did it and he did it in ten can which was the top panel over flashed
1116.54,1118.79, and in
1119.03,1121.49, creation
1121.64,1131.39, no secret again of a lot of action encantadas written by ashamed at the repeated
1131.48,1138.98, the first part he does it amember the names he he goes and blonde and another
1139.25,1158.96, the place in africa that he was big on whipping i was connected collared coat well that's a eluded a woman she soon because obviously that merica was very much kinder think there are so many of these things it floated into
1159.02,1169.97, but low budget in a kind of picture and the flashboard sort of seaside all the best o that stuff for me to emberance
1170.18,1171.5, taylor
1174.44,1187.04, i shall autocratically get along but as she was not helping out the costumes at all you
1187.31,1190.01, the 
1190.19,1202.46, my bible you know they should have been like you and shouldn't some so much polite and so much stuff on and they were not shining i'm sure did was like redtail him i think that such should have been blazing
1202.64,1211.64, was mandatory i catching but it really should have been blazing because i've never seen somebody sequents and
1211.7,1239.51, winston gold gold arrogating of them i mean things possessed like women's costumes to made men's wits denote better a woman in man's costume many costumes a better one or the other do you see any difference nilikanthe red thing with the huge and a good by as had come with me bebee
1239.57,1244.28, that was really wasn't that very close design to the first one eye
1244.73,1274.7, automatons for the man to work on this guy's flying with the wings and all that i mean that stuff is so hard to make you teasing to make it and would so beautifully done tentaculate think of neither tuileries on the wire in front of an enormous blue screen day after day after day trying to make the wings work i mean this must have been a huge namerican see how it really strained the
1274.91,1279.65, the strain the technique in those days so you see a lot of natives and a lot of loose cream
1279.74,1283.76, not that not that in her anything but it was
1283.85,1292.58, there's miles of work in every invitation now it's just the quality of the work is really beautiful and do not as really famous
1292.82,1296.6, the hole his movies equality of the workhouses
1296.87,1301.28, as well as the design but love was very present looking the girl that he 
1301.37,1303.26, you know the princess
1303.53,1306.08, right out of the book right
1307.13,1311.3, so politically that the adamante the director
1313.85,1317.75, it happened in a manservant the wind
1317.84,1319.49, we
1319.58,1324.89, since you were also a initiating about it
1326.21,1330.08, the clothes over powder the actors as of the actress
1330.62,1332.03, very strong
1333.05,1348.2, but in take the side of the castle hill one of the penal ithin you on your play at camp you're in danger you know a one drop more in alathea they started
1348.2,1350.57, no robinhood
1350.57,1358.37, i misdirecting and and and replace was a producer nicodeme he was playing a canonship
1358.55,1360.86, and that last
1361.46,1363.02, eaton
1363.11,1368.0, you said some of the actors are playing at stratton much funnier
1368.27,1372.53, and when they do that but that which is without the first time
1372.74,1378.86, in the second one on a way of threatenest laugh at itself from time to time that an i think it fails
1379.25,1381.62, i would like more control 
1382.52,1388.31, i read shoestore
1388.4,1396.44, well you know when you're also a screen writer which i mean you're the multi mean as do think of the screen writing and particularly in the second picture
1398.3,1411.5, you feel it the fillingford all that isolation because he gave some money producers and the ascertain kind of sexuality and at that they want a political
1411.71,1417.47, like the joke i wanted to get the drug and there's a lot of periods stuff that these trying
1417.74,1420.95, to it and so i just think they said 
1421.22,1442.82, no but it's amazing he got mad allotter handshake that and that's what they wanted were very selfish in that necessitated really but i am the founders alias he really take this possibility for those things hesperina about it and
1443.18,1447.74, as most people know once we get know that they're making a movie out of princess and mars
1448.19,1456.89, very curious about friend of mine designing it and he was going to be here but he thought a town and he says they are really trying to do the victorian romantic
1457.19,1459.47, weird
1459.53,1462.98, i venture as a ebutius
1462.98,1466.19, you know what this picture is being produced by 
1466.19,1471.32, topics our fellow directed by
1471.38,1474.44, one of the actors that canada
1474.44,1476.9, david now which was directing
1478.1,1480.23, understand he did
1481.34,1486.86, so during an enormous literature for dictation
1486.98,1489.74, you know i think we're trying to get to an you have a question sir
1489.74,1493.22, amelia
1497.93,1506.99, the question is was this picture of minette time i don't know how or materially i saw an old bias but her somebody knows
1507.68,1518.15, they were released everglades in a huge hat but that released very differently you know there were many more found semele
1518.48,1523.46, that the whole different system you can compare it to the way they released them to day
1523.67,1530.15, you know that i go out and fly six seven hundred pairs
1530.54,1532.64, didn't last very long
1533.33,1541.58, i move in that period i know what happens to secretaire
1544.79,1553.88, harvest the location see a man to 
1555.41,1560.96, when there is a case of what is people
1561.68,1566.84, agricola
1568.19,1574.88, i rarely
1578.03,1584.63, leverage said there
1584.75,1588.74, for amendment has gone yet
1588.77,1596.75, reversions world up there ye i always been a lot with all of the sort of there's a real wonderful quality to this
1598.64,1606.71, never if i talked to someone in lobber about this question of george lucas wine to do labordette about that
1606.74,1611.33, i was not an amazing because
1611.51,1620.15, has often said that he did star wars because he couldn't get the rights to flush portant if he'd been able to get the right leonore i can't think
1620.54,1621.65, no
1622.28,1623.42, star was
1623.42,1627.83, whatever you think of it for all its virtues i can't think of anything that's more different
1627.95,1640.22, that from labor in a star wars has none of the things that to me make licorne really interesting which is the sort of arch quality and the sensuality and really the craziness of all those things
1640.31,1658.22, even really feel stratagems to do storefront kind of thing to me it's close its close buried you greatness will it is he loves machinery that's another's more machinery but rogers he loved the
1659.33,1661.64, you know for that is back rogers
1661.64,1676.76, covers for famous fancy that's one of the images that bright presented is back and wilma in front with a great big red planet behind them and george
1677.0,1693.95, lucas went to preserve that was his name one of the images he wanted and he tried to get presented to become things for frank any into it at that time for but the head boy would love his as he did a lot of the
1693.95,1700.46, the guys presented tories williams and all in a bunch of red adrastus
1701.48,1711.5, they thought were public manner and had that great i'm glad you did it but you know i own himalaya him eventually that it was a
1712.04,1722.48, it was a good relationship and he loved that stuff why think i gordon said into sort of a canon of science of cousinot really science fiction you what where would you put it
1725.03,1731.09, a high adventure and eleatic world that you know anything exotic
1731.12,1750.26, my generation created jungle girls and i nothing where her anemone from operator is in africa hearing we had not seen since she nattiers ago but in the fifties
1750.38,1777.35, was seen a television show which fills me tenawas what a huge tall rented woman bucketing around the gentle terrably comic but coming home book delegation thirty of men before that pulsating stories and so forth but you no tarzanette ray and i got there all kind of downriver horne love that exotic world with 
1777.65,1805.01, some girl in trouble and this friend exotic world used to lose continues but sort of pain all i just idealities i writing a book on jungle girls inanely it comes to mind a bit stories of the overtasked paste it over jungle stuff for the egoist was
1805.31,1808.64, anything exotic you know 
1808.91,1813.59, the lila clear para
1814.25,1824.09, a hot stuff we just loved all the villains as from the old testament and the new testament that the existing enough
1824.15,1826.88, it was difficult
1827.81,1831.2, when i did the rascals in paradise which is
1832.91,1839.51, i trained under sandpaper and it's about pacinian i trying to put on a bleak
1839.69,1858.11, and a planet and the pony century where half the people go naked to hatteras but you kill anybody that's a that becomes a question when you do that is the ninevites you don't kill him body in the first film
1858.68,1866.09, he may have died but not throws me off in the second time when they catherine
1866.15,1873.05, and they had the similarity with star was his that he had to have sore pride
1873.71,1890.75, there's no real reason to have lights as in others no logic behind it if you've got a blaster but romanones plain george lucas love for so they put the dinner and make it work
1890.9,1896.72, it is a simplicity and a tremendous sincerity
1897.17,1902.09, now in the film and in the comics and it's very very hard to
1902.69,1905.03, to do it like the comic
1905.48,1933.35, in the movies they make from coming to day are not the way the comics were written they are very realistic in many senses all except for the superhuman powers but the eutychian problems he got grown up prominent thing and they kill people on the time that it was a big question for me when i did i do i kill somebody or do i have stunguns
1933.38,1953.12, i talked to that walketh on a talking about this whole sort of female ideal sort of thing in a jungle girls noumaria i referred to earlier as she did this michel i for catastrofe ultimate fetish
1953.24,1971.18, for he was as was that when was patented or ninety two why tell us how that thing evolved because the cattleman the comic was in quite that what he did he did some when in hoddenheim to isolated into that
1972.74,1973.67, well
1974.39,1977.33, i know i am wanted
1978.47,1987.35, he had like some sort of like cat like a calico cat is like a little cat that had stitches and i cut up and as like destitute her
1987.41,2000.91, is a real catlike a toy bisonette had hesketh he went to incorporate stretching into the costume she was falling apart and pulled back together and she had made it herself
2001.45,2006.67, and we were you know bob bring we and i designed it together we would just like
2007.09,2015.85, i can on late so but you know he's a direction and you have to do what he wants
2016.03,2018.76, we ended up sculpting the stitches
2018.97,2025.87, and rubber and cast no katschina them and then blowing them on a late suit
2026.08,2027.76, we had made you know we had
2028.51,2038.5, as a michele and then we made them on the bones of the wise you know i have like fittings forever so you could fit the body cast and then you know the boots and the clubs and the whole thing
2038.86,2041.92, but then blowing the stitches on
2042.43,2051.85, to the late and you know in person the thing i like the biggest messalinda these stitches glued on
2052.0,2073.78, and you know it really really like terrible with good we couldn't get the bluff and you couldn't really clinically so then we painted the whole thing you know michel and the costume in like a pretty heavy silicon which you could do because she didn't go near anybody nobody touched her and so you know so she isoline covered like into sulaco
2073.78,2076.06, then when we tested it
2076.33,2082.9, when bob and i saw the daily of her in her first ranovica in test
2083.11,2089.11, we thought there went up to my inkosisan effect coyotelike thank you really saved us
2089.29,2094.84, wearing about as i thought he had done a visual effect to it to make a lot so good
2095.26,2114.55, it was just the silicon catching the light on the late just made it look like a real and gave it like amazing quality so there was really cioccie that he looked as good as i and tourists certainly seen a lot of imitators
2114.7,2130.18, i've seen a lot of bright whiplash dark which helps when she was never in the broad sunlight would would not have looked the sunlight i ellesmere the deep in the hole came crew descend on her with like hands of dulling spray
2130.21,2147.64, it was really no way to ticonderoga madeline it because the two shaposnik the whole camonica it was so reflective or so they were just like albigensian see a face in it
2147.88,2152.53, and we're just a tiresome just have to make it work because i like it
2152.77,2157.3, norgate did
2157.72,2161.68, we did have to make a couple of dolls for visual facts because they thought
2161.95,2169.15, needlecase they were going to and the shine and later because it might be too hard to photograph with some of the effects of it so shiny
2169.15,2172.33, we did we made a few doses
2173.14,2185.05, my inheriting last i don't you know me i don't know that he had been used in visitation harder and visually at that time obeisant at that time it was harder to put the shinin
2185.05,2188.26, then to take our people's faces 
2189.1,2193.3, interesting evolution on the suits for men in black which
2193.36,2197.89, the model for that nothing gontaut how how that evil
2198.49,2199.84, well
2201.19,2210.79, originally they were supposed to be wearing like all of dirty by type suits like they had had the sense for ever and the stewards going to be in new york you know old
2210.88,2213.07, so the conflict
2213.4,2216.07, this is the director the idea
2216.22,2218.56, we are making these old you know
2218.95,2221.23, type suits
2221.62,2226.03, then you know when to the art department to say that the arras doing
2226.15,2236.29, well who i wore it on that man was designed this fabulous set with all these spiky things and you know very high tech and really beautiful
2236.38,2240.73, i was like you know how my creeses going to fit into this beautiful place
2241.48,2244.18, so like i have to read design them and
2245.26,2249.31, one of my favorite is of all time was the fifth
2249.73,2252.64, from north by northwest that
2252.97,2260.29, a war it was a grace supertonics beautifully cut it was a sixty sottises like cut from a movie star
2260.35,2263.47, well that's what they should look like but in black
2263.5,2267.25, and that's what we made and at the well the director doesn't like
2267.31,2275.83, we can always you know make them look junky less among later so that it was really they were designed to go with the set
2278.05,2282.1, and because you know it doesn't
2282.4,2291.07, this will work together because denominationalist i think will wisely work well in the set and the constrained the potatoes
2291.31,2293.23, as to work together
2293.98,2298.0, you get those two completely to similar guys to sort of fit together
2298.3,2299.77, the civil
