37.92,42.21, during the great storm of nineteen thirteen
42.66,48.72, a tragic tale she felt 
49.47,61.05, great storm was absolutely the most terrific storm that ever hit the great like the giant was thirty five foot high seventy eighty mile o wind
61.65,64.5, last seen
65.4,69.78, cause the demise of ship one of those was the hydra
71.25,86.1, the hydrogen the tremendous punishment coming across lake superior and probably would have been enough to sink a less of a ship and they thought if they had gone through what like separate they probably would be okay going through lake huron
87.06,93.84, remember they had no instruments the only thing they had was a barometer so to the best of their knowledge the storm had obeyed it
93.87,110.07, they decided to make a run for a dollar on and that's when they ran into the worst of it when the waves began to come over the stern the probably got their concern because they realized their lives hang on those engines running
110.16,113.91, anything happened to stop an engine running they were doomed
115.29,121.65, and eventually she loses power and she gets caught in the trough and she can't get out
123.09,126.81, painted now that these conditions were not last for hours
127.29,133.92, and during that period of time we find that somehow portions of crew examined escape in the life
136.74,145.77, i put in the day where absolute lasted they were probably the most ill suited vehicles ever used to save life
145.83,149.76, imagine doing it with some mile away
149.88,153.27, cording of ice on everything and forty foot boys
154.86,160.44, you know when they finally did find one of the lifeless from the hydra it was washed ashore on the canadian side

163.32,168.72, two of those people were colonel and leslie christy a green city
169.41,176.58, been devastating to the family to have two brothers roughly the same age die in the same ship right under the same circumstances
176.76,180.54, at that they were followed fronto that sitting upright in the boat is just
181.14,184.05, it's just an incredible story
184.71,192.78, the day that we discover the hider started out like hundreds of others
193.65,205.92, we take the size and so norandel it over the side and sent it out behind the boat five six hundred feet so that its able i send out sound pattern to come back an image on the ld screen
206.01,255.6, i teriieroterai 
255.63,260.91, we back out on the lagoon to die in the history for the first time on the high
262.5,263.88, along the way
264.03,273.99, the two hour trip doing everything from reading the planning their dies with the woodranger
276.09,308.79, i overhaste kairouan and check their hair with the pure fact in the time one two three entered many divers stood or torpor the break they only spent twenty minutes on the bottom
309.06,314.13, for having to slowly be compressed on the way back to the surface
320.22,321.96, they see history
322.86,329.94, and thought of them all four hundred and thirty six feet of the hides
336.75,343.02, and yet it's also an underwater grave for so
344.04,348.03, i can never get over the fact that they do what professional divers

387.96,397.95, i can understand the raw finding something that no one has ever seen before but why there's a long back and but weak after week after week
400.26,401.67, remarkable
404.43,410.58, the fact that they are gathered so much really good information is on it just be
410.61,414.27, that historians in the future are just going to value so much
414.54,420.3, and never do it testimonies
