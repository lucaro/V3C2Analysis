7.98,10.95, a phrase that's almost become a catch phrase but
11.04,12.72, use it because it's true
12.75,27.42, he is real purging and not going away welcome broadcast and sky watched t v for tuesday march twenty first twenty seventeen under gilbert joining me in studio a man who barely needs an introduction because he has been 
27.42,76.02, the forefront of a couple of cutting edge topics that don't get discussed by our churches the phoenomenon and the search the ongoing search for the nellie of the bible is the author of nettling hybrids he is the star if you will of the watcher series of dew book a collection of his sunday morning commentary posted at his log the sunday go to meeting buttressed you are honored to share a stage with the coming
76.02,89.97, and of course the true legend conference will talk about that coming to our backyard brandon missourian september and of course the less it held prophecy for in october we'll talk about that in just a bit this new project the watchman chronicles is it and what inspired
89.97,195.69, basically i felt the need to kind o go off on my own because i had content that i really wanted to get on film and i just sort of a different direction in their own words it's a person a series of watchman chronicles a sort the over arching umbrella over the entire series in their own words you have bozarris the first installment on there'll be underselling back to back probably to him might be able to squeak out three but i doubt it but you know we're doing all the filming i'm doing all the editing and i went on because i'm all alas conference in the new state that yourself sort of an unscientific call that i talk and i shall thus in the film a monstrum going on in eye has seen a unlike her alice and to tease room dayrell you as a low five per cent not again this is an unscientific poll as a low about five per cent of the people in the audience as a high upwards of thirty five per cent of the people have had an encounter and in the problem is no alangala it the churches are silent they give you the dear and the headlights lock and the bottom line is something is going on every friday the engineers they dominate the conversation and they do dominate the conversation transient astronomers were saying yet were being visited yes though the ancient megaliths around around the planet certainly don't fit into the progression of the history as we know it there seems to be an outside agency manipulating the temple creating these megales we see in balbeck to great pyramids axminster places i mean it's global phenomenon really and so ancient aliens you know are youth is looking at that
195.93,229.5, he looking at the anglian bonesetters that make sense to me and so this whole first instalment in their own words you have pressure i go around and people come on the record from all walks of life we've got pilots we've got doctors medical people professional blue color people i mean it's all across the board house wives grandmothers the whole deal and the theater something some are only closing down of the first game where they see a craft others are taken aboard and sort of a seneca the man by the name of a
229.8,340.53, matthews and we follow at three different times in the film and finally all sort of spilled the beans on what happened to him and how he turned it around and i won't i will tell that because that that you know i don't spoil the punch line of the film pastures we in on the end of the film and state you know why should we be concern about this why should other passes began to tell their congregation about what's going on derected i truly believe that this is the coming great deception that is going to change every one's paradigm on this planet in an instant if crash shall up i mean and really and here's the deal if this canongate has been going on since before roswell we see that we don't see them they appear by donor their own reiterant there you know my thousand people say i upstarting is this catamount never sit at one place and like over the white house and just sit there and go hitalian the fifties okay wants a fly by but the canongate has gone on and at some point in time it's going to end and when it ends i truly believe that this is the coming great deception what will you do when it's in your backyard when it's on your texan some news guy is going well they seem to be here by what do you think will they seem to be friendly to far i mean you know what's going to happen with that how does it contempt your paradise if the church is still here we may be if the church is still here this will cause in my opinion the great falling away the apostacy that we read about the second talons so this this film is for the church from the pastors for non believers it is really all across the board because it especially without testimony it really shows out progression and how he finally comes to realization and get and gets out of the phenomena
340.8,356.07, every time i watch it because i get all the entering on it and i did most of the filling every i mean during the inning process you know you watch these things over and all right adoring times this one senor he kind he finished and he turns to the camera and then turned back and i just choked up
356.1,384.51, every time i see him do it i choke up i mean it is so the some miserable emotion there that that just you know anyway that's what the film is the it well it just doing some rough numbers while you're talking here if you start with just round numbers of the population in the us and trillion percent even if that's the low number that's about million people i've read numbers in other studies that as many as four percent of the us public of said that they've experienced some sort of
384.69,425.31, you encounter whether i was seeing something they couldn't explain or actual experience or people who claim that they've been contacted one way or another by entities that are not of this earth so again we're talking about a substantial part of american population as many as ten often million people that's not you know this is not the radical fringe these are rational productive members of society ventilator at least
425.61,435.66, i guess a better question is how do we explain this to the church at large so that they are prepared for when this actually happens
436.35,507.12, i mean i've written numerous books on the whole of phenomena certainly politics prophecy and murat the cosmic chess match would be another one some some entries in the sunday go to meetin but actually talk about it the coming great eetion satan come to all signs of lying on his motame what does that mean to the average question and churches don't want to talk about that because that's not a film good message and yet it's there you know jesus tells us that let no one deceive you many will come in my name saying i am the christ you know deception is the end game here and so i mean the purpose of the spell and i at the sound self serving because i know some people will look at it that way you know you ask how do we how do we warn the people that's a whole purpose of the film and we have we've got a specially you by one you get the second one half half of sin give it to somebody because the world needs to get out and here's the deal direct what say what's go with a medium number five the thirty five solidity percent or something okalewaha people sitting in europe and your church in the persecutin now and that some kind of an experience and they don't want to talk about their frattanto atalanta i was dontcher of his presence john and georgia
507.15,528.96, it gorgeously get those anyway so i'm down there and is about people there's actually a clipping the film which show that the islip from up above and envies the balcony looking down over the congregation the on the stage and i go how many yes she likes sky you have followed and so the painter son is sitting in the second row
528.99,673.62, the second row and he's like he's like this he's got his hands you know body language right he hides want to hear any of this is just a bunch of a just a bunch of nonsense by the men bring the martian and i mean it was spoke two nights in the first night was like i had to win the crowd over the passes and me that these people don't know anything i went back and i added twenty slides to my presentation step by step line by line presby precept so when we finally got there i have you know people can take the lead so the past is sensation the second row when i asked for a show and in he came up water all excited and he told me the story because he the lowered the bicetre hands that would go on and what blue him aside this twenty five to three per cent of the people we had like to steered hands up in the air i couldn't believe it what's going on you know and i just just we had a nice conversation after that look directly the capucines there is a breeding program they are in planting people we covered some of this in watches and watches were moved the impatient remember guy go back fifteen years ago and i was just starting to you know to speak out and to this custom and other christians laughed me to scorn right when i talked about in plants but we went out and is what we do we goldenheart's where action the thing was close underneath the skin i mean on my making this stuff up right on making it up so we we prove that there is something going on that people are being implanted and what was what was chilling is that these entities knew what we were about to do and the cloak that in plant one prayer changed the environment in the operating theatre and all of a sudden it came into view on the screen that was a startling scene in the the video startling you know very very sober and so again we wrestle not and blood but with wickedness and principalities and in heavenly places this is what we're up against in the church is woefully you know a sleep in regard to the station atalantis a spiritual work for a online this is the coming great perception and in the spring board to it is a darwinian paradigm because darwinism says that
673.71,695.01, there is no god no supernatural everything just happened over millions a year will be near was this is all in the film by the way in their own words watchman chronicles the negoos was said not so fast said son i maybe we were seated here you pants permit may be mere senhor by a race of extraterrestrial advance existential and so
