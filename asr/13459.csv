360.57,362.67, it certainly confirmed
363.15,366.78, its findings the sense that man articulates were
366.78,368.79, overpleased
369.18,371.01, under protected
371.73,374.79, i recommended that all stops
375.03,376.65, searches
376.74,378.96, stop should be recorded
378.99,384.63, the requirement to record searches have been in place since night near
385.68,396.33, it may be to ultimate publication of the person or the portinari levels of stupendous fall from a was an annual tigertail lion
396.48,400.68, operas each year to about three quarters of millionaire
402.18,414.09, in as many causes but it was probably at least partly attributable to the criticism of the police power to stop in search was frequently unlawful that's where there isn't sufficient grounds with suspicion
414.21,415.59, and justified
416.58,419.16, i also argued by some police critics
419.25,424.35, officers were afraid of using the power against a people in case the accused a race
425.7,430.47, how the place istic saw the woman numbers tops of white people not breathable
430.62,432.42, the enquiry
432.66,435.81, black and asian people fell to a much smaller extent
436.47,437.79, the consequence
437.91,444.9, disproportionately in the use of the power and the increased ratio five to one like to it
445.11,450.18, nine to a factor eight to one by two thousand two
450.45,456.33, when we look at the power as a whole black people were even more likely to be unfairly tired
458.19,459.93, okay
459.99,470.49, the situation today are most recent data looked at for this presentation at the evening april to thousand nine and a latialis cardot out four million pegtops
471.12,477.21, i million steps and one million one hundred forty thousand searches
477.33,480.15, people stopped to search percent of black
480.3,492.15, in a recent of mixed ensue were therefore her capital to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched in the white cathars
492.21,493.89, in about twice as well
495.42,500.04, the number of sides increased by thirty percent white people since two thousand four
500.19,503.67, black people stopped to search increased by seventy percent
504.03,508.47, and while the number series cooperators varied
508.59,513.66, of disproportion ality has increased early since the emanating to effort published
516.36,518.49, salabaetto
518.82,525.36, that pattens within groups are also variable so if we do take general as white community
525.81,533.52, the experiences at white minorities such as irish and travellers and migrates antero do different from
533.94,535.5, a community
536.58,540.18, so i iterations stent with eleatics
540.33,548.31, i have a vibration of police research carnaby academics among governmental organizations but also by government
548.97,557.52, and show that not only the finest boncassen but it actually landed at drill down and find out with time of it made the parents
557.61,568.29, what those data show is that black an asian people and we only lived to be stopped but more frequently stopped to more more often lighted to be her repeatedly stopped
568.98,574.44, foot and when the search they were likely to be more intrusively sighed
574.47,581.97, for example not naevia serge in search of a bag or a vehicle and indeed down to stop aches
582.99,587.85, action is more likely in stops involving like people thou
588.42,590.58, the research suggest that when
590.76,597.51, i assured the much more like much less likely to think the place antipathy
602.1,608.73, as well as searches under the police and criminal evidence act which require reasonable suspicion
609.39,623.97, there other powers which permit suspicion less searches which in my view that should not exist on the statute book in my view at licorice only ever intrude into the privacy and liberty of the person and when they have good grounds
624.42,631.02, suspicion section also grown in use so section sixty of the criminal disobedient
631.29,633.51, from 
633.6,640.26, annually in and they lay not in tester hundred and fifty thousand in the most recent that is tis
641.61,643.95, and what you find under this act
643.98,648.0, that the results of that stone is
648.27,649.32, it
651.48,652.95, by little
653.04,656.16, much more likely to be used as proportionately
656.73,664.23, a loose black people something like twenty seven times more likely to be stopped and searched on the white counterpane
664.47,667.11, about six times as likely sir
668.88,674.01, but raises the question of why people at the minorities are more likely to be stopped searched
674.55,679.05, one view is the police officers deliberately target minority of the groups
679.11,682.71, of widespread recuperative steadying
682.77,684.81, over discrimination
685.5,688.83, certainly numerous prominent black people
689.04,703.41, including man of cloth senior civil servants police officers and there was a parliament had been stopped without justification as the very powerful piece of research carried out in the early nineteen eighty
703.41,706.44, and organization called the politics that is institute
706.47,708.72, and the use of race language
708.72,713.82, accepted expected and even fashionable in the police
713.97,728.55, i apologetically use color as a criterion the stops they said yes of course we stop that people because in time by a ten day will be involved in crime and ninety nine per cent of the crime in this area is coming to play black people
729.21,734.16, that report said this quite please officers tend to make a crude equation
734.37,736.02, we climb and black people
736.47,741.45, he suspects of black and to justify stopping people on these terms
742.14,747.66, after the severance a couple of years after the police generally believed that
747.72,750.0, been eradicated from the british police
751.59,754.08, in alternate
754.56,760.08, four years after the publication of inquiry there was the bbc documentary called the secret policeman
760.77,764.07, a search with thermometrical questions about it
764.31,767.31, he was guatama only
767.97,771.0, plebiscite
771.93,773.22, under cover
775.23,781.26, i and what he did was to carry our cogitating within the police organization
782.1,786.99, and he found that managers there was a crew
787.08,790.14, it explicitly said that they were looking forward
790.29,804.21, the samples officers to target people lethingtoun ties and some of the film is quite shocking including one crop justine a catholicon using extreme races language
805.35,806.4, and
806.52,809.64, the place forces concerned
809.73,811.98, news of this
812.4,817.11, the footman the first reaction was to arrest the journalist concern
817.83,818.97, i
819.36,824.82, and i realize that actually the extent of richard's moaningly
825.99,828.0, nitocris
828.0,831.99, quite extreme and racey definitely had not
834.48,836.16, a
836.79,843.87, so what we find when we looking at epicures that these stores powers which have a wide discretion
844.38,847.77, officers are able to use their own intuition
847.89,850.29, yes eyes
850.59,852.27, explicable hunches
852.75,855.36, those are the most likely to be discriminatory
856.32,861.12, for this reason that disproportionally tends to the widest intruders
862.47,866.1, those that require no element of reasonable suspicion
868.38,872.07, no explanation for his potentates to be targeted
872.13,874.95, disproportionately antinomies
875.13,878.04, istorical and demographic factors
878.13,882.27, atonement letter activities
883.2,885.48, some of argue that
885.6,889.26, a nation people in britain assalamo frequently available
889.86,893.25, time and in the places that potentates carried out
893.94,894.99, that
895.32,898.62, place themselves at risk of being stopped
898.86,903.63, the police to the different use of public space attend to be out early in the morning along
904.86,910.44, and because policing tends to bear down disproportionately on people are out at tonight
910.5,912.18, in the morning
912.3,913.83, just happens
913.98,916.35, directly the wastepipe who end up
916.38,917.94, teach
918.42,919.95, an interesting
919.98,921.45, explanation
922.26,926.55, see the possibility that discriminated as it always direct
926.55,934.56, the indirect but numberless has the effect from the point of view the people being stopped a search to be features
935.97,939.24, the explanation it seems inheritor
939.54,942.66, the criminal ization minority communities
942.69,945.06, in public support the police
945.66,947.22, in the second
948.45,955.05, it seems to me that a number of negative consequences flow from the unfairness in the suspense
957.36,959.34, talking means that
959.49,964.62, in which exists within glaciation communities as it exists within any other community
964.68,969.87, but it's more likely to come to public attention is more complete attention if
970.2,973.8, communities are the targets of police practice
976.83,979.23, six per cent in breton
979.68,981.78, white which as people
981.93,985.02, six percent of people who enter the criminal just a system
985.29,988.17, to the system as it was out of stone
988.35,990.39, exactly double
990.42,992.04, i like a man
992.31,993.48, whereas
993.54,997.92, it's true that for all time it is most people come to the attention to police because amongst
997.92,999.36, dacre
1000.29,1001.76, a man to
1001.85,1003.2, rest
1003.92,1008.81, lettice as likely to enter the system as it is not depriving
1010.64,1018.29, secondly because they hit rate but as the water arose arising from stupider it's about the same for each group
1018.62,1019.97, that
1020.06,1023.42, six times as many innocent black people in britain
1023.96,1043.07, stop and sired by comparison with the inconstant and these you seems to me explains why there is such a wide spread and ramonette across the community as a whole because it means that racial profiling isn't only targeted at by people dontucci
1043.34,1047.66, black academic civil servants and vicious
1047.84,1050.72, ruin to the fishing net
1051.5,1055.37, an course stoppered doesn't come without cost
1055.64,1057.56, experience of being stopped
1057.68,1061.88, he means that the person is being treated as a suspect
1062.42,1065.81, personally and this i think is true of everybody
1066.02,1070.34, as a suspect goes against the grain of oitalian a democracy
1070.67,1075.26, we presumed innocent until there is evidence or suspicion about gold
1076.64,1082.4, as a suspect being asked to turn out a pocket on the streets to be subject to a search
1082.4,1084.35, embarrassing and inconvenient
1084.8,1086.9, the maritime
1087.71,1092.51, and it seems to me that this is a kind of incident or collateral damage
1093.35,1095.03, we innoculation
1095.45,1097.7, wide spread
1098.15,1104.66, experience perception of unfair even of all stops as urges were justified inclination
1104.87,1106.31, what
1106.79,1113.66, in those under one crown of suspicion fear of them one at a etearchus out to be
1113.69,1116.12, found nineteen o ropes
1116.87,1123.56, a disproportionate impact on itinerants would still create the experience of being unjust tirade
1124.82,1130.67, only i think the unfair use of stone he is criminal it is actually
1130.7,1132.5, crime producing
1133.52,1136.79, the police often compare spouse with fishing
1138.17,1141.65, such fishing expeditions are not only ineffective and inefficient
1142.07,1147.65, a harmful impact on the sea bed of informal social control and police legitimacy
1148.37,1150.2, in recent years in brooklyn
1150.38,1151.7, these were
1151.76,1155.54, no formal sort of control of being cast more widely
1155.78,1157.7, a thin
1157.88,1161.03, the speed of too has increased
1161.36,1165.38, the result has been the civilization not on the big fish
1165.71,1166.94, a small fire
1167.9,1170.33, experience of being unfairly targeted
1170.36,1172.64, that legitimacy of the police
1173.6,1176.27, and this in turn has the material effect
1176.27,1178.25, undermining the willingness
1179.78,1182.42, victims to pass information to the police
1183.26,1185.84, olympias with the law
1187.19,1192.83, no democratic policing practice can survive without legitimacy and consent
1193.61,1196.88, years ago some of it for such a coil
1197.06,1198.44, we
1200.42,1203.48, a secure base of community support
1203.72,1205.01, concerned
1206.33,1210.02, use of stop anarch power rapidly becomes
1211.28,1212.24, an effective

1215.33,1219.59, exercise of police power to constantly to be recessed
1220.19,1222.86, relation to arrest and clear at
1223.34,1227.06, also in the light of the effect on the community as a whole
1227.87,1229.4, she said
1229.61,1233.72, the satisfactory and brutal exercise of power in this area
1233.9,1239.33, and crucial in the long term of police action being deceived by individuals and groups
1239.75,1243.17, acceptably fair and rational
1243.65,1246.56, seems to me to be really important
1249.05,1253.73, venison and effectiveness are inseparable
1253.97,1255.89, two sides of the same coin
1256.52,1259.19, at openhearths not used fairly
1264.32,1266.3, it undermines
1266.51,1272.36, when lothaire it while the room by reasonable suspicion
1272.87,1275.36, overwhelming majority in england
1277.07,1279.02, on innocent people
1279.56,1282.53, and when a significant proportion the population
1282.83,1285.62, populations are affected by its use
1286.07,1287.54, it
1287.81,1289.7, stoner
1289.7,1293.24, be fair if it fails to provide protection
1293.24,1296.45, leaves the most vulnerable sections of society
1296.51,1297.56, protected
1298.82,1303.77, there's no doubt that insensitive policing lies a root of last summer's rains
1304.28,1308.03, instituting a maclaren
1308.54,1311.96, of the police to provide a proper account of what happened
1313.28,1317.63, the empirical evidence of the toxic effects of certain kinds of strangulating
1318.17,1329.96, especially computational taxes like stomach has been built up of operas or more and the most recent research have for lonesome shows that that is indeed a deception
1330.05,1333.47, all oppressive policing is part of the background
1333.56,1335.24, and some of the tricks
1335.69,1337.16, to the ryans
1338.33,1342.2, and so may the summer two thousand eleven echoed
1342.5,1344.12, was said
1344.99,1349.91, years ago bargemen conclusions arrived at magione
1349.91,1356.48, at first the angelieris the police still rings true to day in britain and elsewhere
1358.7,1362.84, i you were about supplicatingly perspective
1365.15,1368.96, and whatever language police thought how to
1369.32,1373.73, umbopa out to put an eyelid

1983.96,1985.91, proving
1986.03,1989.36, better ways to communicate
1989.93,1995.27, i want to end it with a few words about place accountability which i think is of a very heart of this debate
1996.83,2001.51, in a democratic society is the use of that part always be justified
2002.2,2006.37, the aberration useful and effective in general
2007.12,2010.42, justified in any individual case
2011.17,2012.94, and the way in which
2013.0,2016.51, plan be shown to be justifiable on legitimate
2016.57,2018.46, accountability
2018.94,2021.52, for me accountability is testified
2021.67,2024.07, the legal scholar guaymas
2024.94,2029.83, under penetration of placing on island at the end of the troubles
2030.31,2033.19, a conceptual bases were countable on where
2033.64,2037.6, marshal service account of the police should be countable on those
2039.37,2043.09, in the sense of being expanding combative
2044.29,2045.43, secondly
2045.43,2047.92, the sense of being overdone
2048.13,2049.3, bedient
2050.77,2052.99, if you were about both of those
2053.86,2056.62, the need for explanation and corporation
2056.68,2059.56, to the police began to account for themselves
2059.65,2061.84, explain what they do
2061.99,2064.12, affect
2064.57,2070.75, the requirement of the decay basis but it's particularly important when things go wrong with the difficulty for sale
2072.4,2076.21, in addition to the police in olivette
2076.39,2077.74, the need to be
2077.8,2079.18, to account
2079.6,2082.45, see the held responsible for the activity
2082.75,2084.46, the eyes of the public
2084.82,2088.66, this is the need for the police to be subordinate
2088.81,2090.28, the will of the people
2090.7,2092.5, obedient to the
2094.0,2096.79, placing a supposed to be full the people
2097.06,2101.68, working for themselves for the powerful not the government
2101.68,2103.36, you the community
2104.56,2108.7, so in coyote think about all the ways in which the police can be held to account
2109.27,2113.95, pain and all four in which accountability could be gained
2114.31,2117.55, a pleasing as well as in latin to complain
2117.73,2126.04, i want farncourt able policing looks like when he exists no mechanism for the police to explain themselves to the public
2126.46,2130.09, no properly independent body fringes the provisions
2131.29,2134.5, and i counterbalancing information
2135.04,2138.37, i think that collecting good information on policing
2138.46,2140.2, i in the pursuit
2140.35,2142.09, effective living
2142.93,2146.29, it will always be important to highlight individual cases
2147.1,2150.43, things go wrong and policing where power is abused
2150.58,2154.24, not being done probably the right to be infringed
2154.42,2155.59, so
2155.83,2157.12, but
2157.36,2160.24, we communities for families lawyers
2160.51,2167.89, friend activist like a demi adlersparre to assure that as much information as possible brought the public demand
2169.78,2172.87, literal and individual cases
2173.44,2176.92, obliteration highlights parents of prejudice
2177.43,2178.57, i
2179.35,2181.39, please passed
2181.45,2186.22, some of the data can be elected by community based legalisation
2188.11,2192.04, planning to the police against the police instance
2192.19,2194.83, can be plebiscites
2195.22,2199.66, but much of that date requires a proper collaboration between police and the community
2200.47,2205.12, principle that community and police have a share interest in good place
2205.3,2207.88, i have a share interesting community safety
2208.69,2215.86, both have a shared interest in assuring that information and what the police do it they do it that if the
2215.95,2222.22, able to the community but it licorice should give a receipt the person has been stopped searched
2222.31,2225.13, keep a ripple away went on

2228.61,2230.2, seen stopped
2230.2,2233.38, for managerial and public scrutiny
2234.13,2236.77, information is not an end in itself
2236.98,2238.87, the way to bring about
2239.38,2245.56, to bring to light the wind powers a used and to identify patterson profiling and the public view
2246.67,2248.74, said by the police
2248.77,2250.63, nothing to hide
2250.99,2253.57, no fear now

2256.42,2258.67, the enemies with the state
2259.09,2260.98, justified and the intrusion
2262.06,2265.15, i think that it defies to the place
2265.93,2267.7, he 
2268.12,2270.01, i think that they have nothing to fear
2270.13,2274.09, information on storage persons stopped
2274.12,2275.71, the public
2276.28,2278.41, absolutely pitiful
2278.59,2281.32, i should be able to give an account of themselves
2281.35,2283.93, to be held to that
2285.13,2290.26, i think the state organizations especially there is that have the power to come through to in the privacy
2290.47,2291.67, as
2291.82,2293.92, a responsibility
2294.19,2296.17, justification of it
2296.38,2299.05, standing light of the state
