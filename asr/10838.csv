1.74,84.3, time is now to move beyond the shadows of the meadow and for evermore live onward et cetera when i was nineteen i had this recurrent dream and i would be be waking up makedama like in the desert or in a bed and at the end of the dream i would always find something with onward and carpenter was a piece of tree bark or a school desk or even like some one skin i tell it remittent onward drink another dream while onward and it was complimentary wanting to go back there i would mentally put myself back into a state of mind where i wanted to go back to the dreamlike up in the tree romance myself i knew where i wanted to go we have arrived then settling misopogon
85.08,137.7, that's what i decided just moving forward as an enough any more entire a song in a short my time like a week or two i grow anxious and i get cast a project in a sense i feel like the world in clapping him on my and then the minute that something happens to it like a like a fire panels upon
139.2,165.66, i have the feeling that i need to get something on paper and i'll sit down and pump out a song whether it's in two minutes or two days once it's done its complete release from anything that i've ever been worried about whether i don't know what insleep that night or i don't know why i'm going to end up in a week that that one song just look here at all
169.98,306.21, there's no other feeling that makes me happier than leaving some i love having people and places and things like that but the minute that i reached the city limits and there is nothing but open road and knowing that i'm going somewhere that i need to be that's the drug motorboat together to fall in love rendereth way that i do write i transpose to every one whether or not they experience the same thing that i felt while i was writing some the sadness or the happiness that i felt through writing it and the excitement the party that went on that i brought about that was like one of the best knights my life they can take in any way they want but it's there like i don't want to give it to ontario
