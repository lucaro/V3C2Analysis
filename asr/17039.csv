6.57,15.03, somebody is penetrated and then the butterless into the release
15.18,16.59, the green
18.33,23.25, and a certain point you don't know if the leaves are moving or the cameras moving
23.25,28.26, she slyndicate very dark
28.65,31.26, love that kind of cut where you go from the
31.56,36.0, you see us beginning to fill good momentarily and release
36.33,37.8, and all of a sudden
37.8,39.24, remembrance
39.39,41.52, the shadow and your syce
41.91,47.22, so so there's an example as i said a word visual and
47.43,51.54, and when the films are good to me they always
51.75,63.63, was that there's that level of leering we should want your actual question but is it a very important level of laramie so then there's the other subject of the letter shots
63.75,66.72, seemed to be direct metaphors
69.24,73.53, for state or state of mind in a sense 
73.53,78.57, you are all saying he is seeing you lie so that's one layer
78.6,81.78, then there's this other layer which is what is
81.78,84.81, of our own emotional history
84.9,86.76, emotional landscape
87.06,91.26, upon a way later and would see me right
91.32,94.2, also the kind of surface
94.71,97.77, at the consulate tension
97.83,99.96, inside an outside
100.17,102.96, i think the good shots have
103.08,105.0, the internal world
105.54,107.61, of surface tension
107.79,111.21, it was like the surface of a pond of water
111.36,112.62, and then
112.8,114.9, see
115.41,117.72, out through the
117.9,119.16, three
119.43,124.17, in the first film i made when i was to come but angry
124.77,128.88, i used the motif i could realize this to later how
128.91,136.62, from the beginning these things are i used to notice of you know an english colossean it's a keeperess
137.1,140.46, you know a kind of screen and 
140.58,143.22, and that files a note of
143.61,148.53, right up like an apostatising onto the screen
148.8,152.43, and does that a lot through the film right 
152.46,154.23, a certain point
154.35,164.28, in the film that character has an organ sexual organ and i go up to the screen and then i focused
164.58,167.25, so there's this kind of release
167.31,178.56, the containment and i realized that right for a beginning i was very interested in coming up to the surface where you cachema be holdin on territory
178.89,182.28, psychologically where you you stop
182.58,186.42, of a sudden dissolving that attention
187.2,188.55, to union
188.73,189.57, now
190.44,193.89, i think a lot of this sentiment aphorist they has to do with
193.92,195.72, later to
196.08,197.22, express
197.55,202.71, the holding power of the psyche you know of your own self identity
202.92,204.24, well it
204.39,206.64, you released through that
206.67,210.81, it seems to me that one those that you release
210.87,215.22, then his fear right in the established
215.91,218.43, the wall on a
218.82,222.93, you can release the so i think the films in a way or exercising
224.43,229.53, the fear establishing the territory releasing the territory
230.28,231.12, now
231.66,234.51, the traditional cinematography
235.29,236.46, always
236.7,240.54, ingratiatory always has three layers
240.57,243.6, a foreground middle ground in background
244.11,246.99, the greater film makers if you look at them
247.56,250.02, there's always 
250.11,253.47, musical you know there counterpoint
253.71,255.75, a big man
255.93,259.47, a volcano her you know
259.62,266.25, and sedentary there's something about the three is this kind of magical combination
266.34,269.16, for round little ground and background
270.6,272.37, you look at paintings
272.67,278.07, to a very great period of time was in the middle of the fortunes
278.73,283.44, a very great time in painting harrateen the medieval and renaissance
284.1,285.87, a period
286.26,290.37, the matron great paintings from the period
290.76,301.62, thinking earlier period how can you know you know years earlier you know but it's not so much spanish painting dinsmore
301.65,307.98, from her begotten northern panetela painting
308.37,311.22, you know this painter memling
311.49,317.13, moreover training that are the proliferates
319.2,322.56, the point is that you know is a period when
323.88,327.45, wasn't he wasn't the flat world
327.48,329.67, who is now an it wasn't
329.67,332.4, the showing off of perspective
332.88,338.61, there is a kind of balance point i like that every painting that a period of painting very much
339.18,342.27, so demographic
342.36,348.09, something about one contained in the canaanite three is so magical
350.25,365.67, if you look at me so really great you realize it always is eleseus is always to throw three layers going on nineteen the same shot off for eating
365.79,368.22, then when do we
368.58,375.6, delaplaine oysters
376.92,380.07, has the sellers of activity
380.55,384.27, i think he meant so many silent films as a youth
384.72,386.73, a minute movies
387.33,390.54, he made his first feature films about
390.93,401.34, his cold straight shooting facetiously overstraining was insanity
401.43,411.72, no i think interessenvertrag shooting you know you already can see
411.84,420.36, renting it you know it's all starting to happen the textures and then i know it myself 
420.69,422.34, if there are
422.61,427.35, on the five or six film makes the who affected me
427.56,430.86, effect affords one of the kayans
431.37,435.09, people said how is your films like red and 
435.36,437.01, and i would say
437.91,440.58, for discovered is that he always shot
440.61,442.95, toward the light source
443.58,445.29, most of my horse
445.56,450.6, with the light going to sway forward always shut against the light
450.72,463.47, when you shoot against the life in a way it is kind of casement because of the anyway is almost a pure in the dark looking felony exterior shot and afford film the shadows
463.56,468.3, coming towards the canoes at least this announced
468.45,480.9, ever see this never that he never going away from me the shadows of coming towards you so you have that attention and you can see in the early saundersonius covering that i go sudden to be some shots
480.93,483.78, a real for show it's got and what it is 
483.93,487.05, in terms of the camera toward the light
487.26,492.75, i think the cameraman used to complain to you because these difficult
492.78,494.85, exposure how do you
495.6,499.65, the exposure of the eatin the shadow you know
500.16,507.18, you have to florida little bit and obviously in the future you have reflections and you can kick like back
507.48,510.99, even the lights coming this way and can kick like back
511.32,513.27, toward in filling
513.3,515.76, still there's the attention you know
515.88,519.54, the river very strong with the lawyers
521.7,528.45, the creator is either still that
528.51,530.58, the case of a thing that
530.7,533.28, films were vision
533.4,535.83, you know in the vision is caused me
535.92,543.27, other directors might under not know that vision is caused in the distancing pictures of a drama
543.69,547.38, under that in itself was cause
548.19,552.78, very important but helpful
555.18,573.96, do you know the black and white films of their tonic of course the early before the show you know i like wearied a shouter whether genteelest in the chronicle of a lover is first feature
574.59,588.33, some short yes aloive six sonneteers and underneath was the first and that ends very suddenly i have because i think he lost
588.42,591.03, negatively the during the war
592.05,598.32, and the one on the street cleaners a wrong grade that has very layered
598.86,611.46, the leather comedians but that of future debutantes of shouldering telenosis quite amazing
611.61,614.25, what is superstition
616.08,620.25, you can have a very good deed now of his first feature called
620.34,629.37, i therefore just watch the film i mean can watch it
629.79,633.21, just watch the camera attitude and what happens in it
634.71,639.72, sort of that none could make a first feature film that qualities
639.96,641.25, owing to 
641.4,643.5, terms of layers
644.22,653.58, also you know later in life time it will make a big deal and maybe in traffic the coordinated sixty degree
653.91,659.28, so it was come very is not really is not profound in astor
659.55,662.13, and it's a big deal where
662.16,665.55, as with their planning the murder
665.61,669.93, amelia the going to shoot some one shoot someone a card
670.38,674.22, whole planning sea is a degree shot
674.52,676.83, the car coming up the road
677.31,680.85, wouldn't know it it's so amazing
680.85,684.45, i could not even realize that has happened
684.63,686.34, you know
686.73,691.44, just that as just to watch that film you can wash it
692.01,695.76, and the camera attitude the way it is with people in the room
695.79,699.36, it caresses people
699.66,703.14, that's standing in
704.01,705.3, really
705.36,712.56, i looked on interestedly say you can get it as fades
713.19,720.15, it starts out very modest just like a detective story fresh did you recommend this film is
720.27,724.44, kind of ordinary for a lot you know the first in five or 
724.5,727.92, slowly cannot
728.31,731.55, that's a great film to watch for the eye
755.16,777.45, i attaining a satellite where battiste shongotongo homologating wainamoinen catenation
777.57,809.88, competition intention posteriorem eenamost protestantism on military topics to employ orientation

912.15,938.46, i anointing thinking and he was constitutionally a eolian intonation
938.58,1035.69, ratiocination a pace do not hear i should be newiehawannock mineralogist come to something in eagerness tenaciousness openheartedness etiennette 
1039.53,1046.58, to
1051.08,1059.6, the only time i come back to something as if i didn't have my camera with me whereas something
1059.63,1063.92, you always are that you can never come back it's never the same
1064.04,1069.38, the light is different the wind is different the something is different sometimes you can
1069.62,1073.76, the things in my film but i have that i tried three or four times
1073.88,1077.3, the first time i realize is potentially
1077.36,1079.55, really interesting but i didn't get it
1079.73,1093.86, go back to her three times but most of the time at something which spontaneously happens in the moment you angry i didn't bring my with myself i am in my bower with me on this trip
1093.92,1099.2, is going to be never been to spain is going to be no time
1100.61,1103.04, in madrid true
1103.04,1115.43, and also there's so many crazy looking paintings there every day about our museums when the most astounding collection of paintings in esthetes city in the world
1115.76,1117.77, for painting
1119.09,1132.74, then i came here and i said this lifelike san francisco you know it is the sea air the corsair the hot sun and the light were casilear the white has a certain kind of
1133.1,1145.19, quality and yesterday's walking around i do why did i bethought i would to testify owls
1145.64,1151.19, the four day i have days when i could just walk around my camera
1151.61,1158.54, i really got a little lazy as that on the cantabrian you can have and on the plain you
1158.75,1164.0, the stock and your luggage at the carrion your back back
1164.18,1166.55, as i say usually
1166.55,1170.15, and the hills percent not percent of the stuff
1170.24,1172.04, spontaneously
1172.37,1174.92, and i would come alcobaca
1176.84,1179.24, as i said i didn't have my camera
1179.81,1181.85, i always
1182.09,1188.0, happy i have my camera with me because you can see could just ask you to go to
1188.69,1194.09, one morning he and olinto do my work and do aright
1194.21,1195.92, so your sitting
1196.16,1197.87, as around
1198.8,1200.15, and
1200.42,1202.52, about that
1202.85,1224.93, someone else is that another in the interviews are piling up so much said i have these fingers come forward obliterating and adoration when it's not specific its flesh and feels penafiel like there's a seducer the something right so that was some one wanted to have a
1225.2,1229.34, one morning i was resisting and i and my work
1229.4,1239.06, notionate just go with your time and then open his hand was on the table and the light was coming through some kind of
1239.39,1241.67, it was that made it very
1241.79,1245.09, he ended up in an important imagine film
1245.75,1250.04, so i think that the kind of flaying now it's important
1251.45,1255.74, be open to circumstance we don't know where the magic will happen
1256.28,1265.25, go out with their caravansery pretty spot and come back with no footage and if you go to paris for two weeks at the canaanite
1265.28,1271.43, your waiting some place in the airport in missus little thing and that becomes
1271.97,1275.36, he becomes the magic
1275.36,1282.26, the genetically happens is here seen something which your interesting
1282.56,1290.69, a certain tension in the life so of attraction i just like you walking down the street and you might be some one who find a trace
1290.84,1293.24, before he can think about it
1293.57,1305.51, you're looking you know to be a suitable shape it could be a down the block on block you know and i computation sudden there's something which
1306.08,1311.75, before your concept you know the animal part of your mind
1312.83,1316.61, you know how i like your mind knows things before you do
1316.76,1323.36, mind as you know your mind is smarter than you are as you get older you realize that more and more
1323.48,1326.93, you know you know you know your mind knows
1326.99,1334.19, the last person to know your mind those below the sand as your mind was ten years for you to know
1334.55,1336.68, the money now you know
1339.17,1346.31, so you see something some kind of tension in the light like a great talking it looking out here and
1346.55,1350.03, the shadows from the palm trees on the
1350.66,1356.69, i see you know certainly my just attract you which way
1356.9,1366.89, the point is that i assignation which attraction but then you look at through the camera and it may not translate
1366.92,1372.29, that's where the skill comes sometimes i look through the cam or for a man in 
1372.44,1374.93, he just never pushed the button
1375.05,1379.85, when you look in the waiting for it to translate and then i'll sing relation you can't
1380.36,1391.79, there's ice in the real world but you can't get this you can't get the frame it's one thing that hitch i learned from witchcraft know he said the only thing you see
1391.88,1397.37, one thing that counts and the film is the friend this is to humanities matter where
1397.61,1411.56, reality is the frame he was very rembrandtine when in my twenties and in a really struck me you know it ethelfrith only thing
1411.74,1415.49, you can't turn the frame into something
1415.49,1429.98, but assimilation to something and you look at it and it's it's kind of dead in the camera and when i let her go from there where you might there shots that shot my films were
1430.19,1434.63, statehood something and then you just turn to
1434.9,1436.49, some kind of tension
1436.52,1438.89, a cornington 
1439.04,1443.39, i corinthe gravity and the broader of the screen in the same thing
1443.54,1448.28, is very strong i got for the gravity
1448.97,1451.64, earth and the gravest very important
1451.82,1457.43, is it a shot the gravity is very best way the profoundness is other times
1457.58,1460.61, gravity and relationship to the show
1460.97,1466.28, a cottage shot from taking off into a more state of mind
1466.31,1468.05, you sitting
1468.05,1474.11, and sometimes you alteration or upside down
1474.41,1478.94, the oars in the white upside down before all of a sudden the frame
1479.48,1489.38, come magicians the frame is the only real you know so that the frame becomes magenta the shot by the lake that
1489.65,1501.2, magical you don't know that if you know you're doing that thing it's not magical you know benefit just as a retort so i think that my false people don't understand things
1501.26,1502.55, sometimes
1502.55,1506.81, something almost upside down but i feels
1507.62,1510.5, it doesn't feel like upside down
1510.56,1513.77, that would be a concept of its sons
1514.1,1516.23, it feels like something
1520.46,1527.51, have you ever seen the film the made in germany before he came to hollywood i beforehand
1527.69,1529.64, in accord
1530.39,1533.84, printing receives at the british filming
1533.9,1543.92, it's my really great to see him do not hollywood coyotepe type of film it's about a symphony conductor
1543.92,1545.57, ramon
1546.32,1547.64, fabulous
1548.21,1549.83, i really
1550.43,1552.23, extraordinary
1552.5,1555.35, not the hollywood since
1555.83,1558.17, different field you know
1558.23,1563.45, do to a three or four this one did that australia called 
1563.78,1567.77, stores or an indistinct
1567.89,1571.43, debutante and final accord
1571.79,1573.92, really well it's not
1573.95,1577.01, place in new york and berlin at the same time
1577.88,1584.18, you know there's a conductor of the bell in pulmonary these two music lovers
1584.33,1588.62, listen in new york on the radio to the blue
1588.95,1592.34, then believe it not their lives become
1593.3,1596.18, on another through a child
1596.84,1598.25, the 
1598.67,1601.07, it is very extraordinary
1601.22,1603.77, very imaginative
1605.0,1608.42, at any rate i don't know if i can
1608.63,1610.46, i know that the hitchcock
1612.35,1616.7, his sense of color you know
1617.15,1621.26, amazing for you know vertigo of course
1622.07,1623.39, and
1623.42,1626.42, mister of course is
1626.42,1627.86, brown
1628.49,1633.8, serena made in his greeting of thing
1634.94,1639.11, poverty that are filled with the lowest
1639.2,1641.75, follows her into the grave yard
1641.96,1643.19, mission
1643.34,1644.84, as
1645.02,1647.27, he's going in to see the
1647.54,1650.12, cottage
1650.33,1654.98, these following her and you know it you know that that's
1655.64,1660.59, a section of that film about ten minutes long which is one of the most astounding
1661.52,1668.03, it's up there with a great things enemies it's so
1669.74,1673.64, is a store with his watching her compatible
1673.67,1679.88, house and following her driving it has everything it has the taging to the
1680.54,1695.09, as going to the museum at watching her looking at the panting and that it has got following her and going to the grave yard as a long sequence of the pen but in a grave yard
1695.42,1697.73, shots are so beautiful of
1698.27,1708.65, chris main syntax is point of view and you know the person look at him lately seen but that his man
1709.04,1712.7, founded in fillmore else does that
1712.7,1716.33, the making is as like you and then what you see
1716.42,1719.96, and what you see you know
1720.38,1724.88, so a very immoral cinema because it has to do with
1725.06,1731.54, seeing something no it's not about to draw you know it's bad seeing things
1731.78,1735.68, so then this is are in that graveyard where
1735.68,1738.08, the irish as these flowers and
1738.29,1739.82, in this way
1740.15,1742.64, you keep reversing
1742.91,1750.11, the angles and the things that are in the foreground becomes the background and another shot really
1750.71,1752.48, and of course it's
1752.51,1755.96, the school the musical score at that point is
1756.59,1759.41, i know strether's no better musical school
1759.77,1764.87, imagine for to go without that school you know that nothing cost
1764.93,1775.58, mister strength have you ever had seen the film other nick rail on dangerous ground of course oh you goose
1775.64,1785.84, but a great score and there's a prothero odometer is i saw them moving on localities
1785.96,1791.75, it's a sketch for forthwith and jesuit
1791.87,1794.66, extraordinarily great school
1794.93,1800.48, every one and while now people are having festivals based on bradamanti schools
1801.08,1806.0, you know you know i did the music for citizen can
1807.98,1808.91, the
1809.33,1810.89, very interesting to
1811.01,1815.42, on dangerous ground from the point of view i mean as a great
1816.95,1820.31, i think it really influenced the new way a lot to
1820.37,1824.69, because of the sense of going out into the country out into the snow
1824.93,1831.38, think effected in both as you know that and also of course should the piano player and things like that
1831.86,1835.19, a really effective and no way to manly
1836.6,1838.79, the scores of gorgeous
1839.72,1840.98, just
1843.2,1844.43, lost
1844.46,1851.06, no they were talkative bifasciata to my own work
1853.76,1857.33, articulation color is extremely important
1857.48,1861.17, i don't know any other filmer should only be self
1861.17,1863.18, talking of doctor
1863.81,1865.67, the prow
1865.82,1867.95, the progression of color
1868.22,1870.2, really articulate
1870.74,1873.98, i mean of course you know people are hitchcock and so forth
1874.28,1877.94, it's designed and every color when
1878.12,1883.19, you know if someone has a morning as a yellow pocket book
1883.58,1887.42, i mean everything is you know thought about very carefully
1889.13,1890.84, i may
1890.96,1900.23, you know that's one of the reasons i can't go to movies so much more modern movies i don't enjoy is there not interested in the way i mention
1900.71,1911.75, most modern movies are very modern the orate have the famous back lip le smoke seemed the battle blue
1911.81,1921.17, brethren one cares what clothes any one is wearing on
1921.92,1926.84, you know they're not fatally gratifying
1928.16,1930.8, do not let well and they're not
1931.13,1934.22, other weird thing about them is that
1934.88,1945.5, i think there's something about taking actors between them i don't know and color with a color film emotion then and written and real situations
1945.77,1949.76, not being aware of the color and the real situation
1950.27,1953.69, on the very topple i think 
1956.45,1959.81, the french villager whose films always
1960.47,1964.52, it's a new way in malice was in having it
1964.88,1967.19, it is such a famous
1967.61,1969.23, no way filmer
1969.41,1972.68, french entreaties
1972.95,1983.36, i totalitarians colossal a kid were were kids we used to play parts
1983.42,1987.71, to school but a certain point that we were discontents
1987.8,1996.23, be playing an organized game but then it would always end with everyone is jumping as electrolier is a very discipline
1996.5,1999.71, then with that if twenty minutes to go he just says
1999.8,2011.41, i foreseeing of economies in his emissary one kill every one 
2011.47,2013.96, i think he's times
2013.96,2015.4, very very good
2015.67,2018.73, cotillion on the framing
2018.94,2021.4, not all the time
2021.61,2023.65, but you know and
2024.22,2028.03, his great incensories
2028.03,2030.01, ever seen
2032.74,2034.78, he went
2034.87,2042.25, reflowering is coyoteros yes osceola alter
2042.25,2045.61, i soused
2046.03,2058.15, just now and also let artemis the most amazing late yes it's my favorite soirees a close up exchange
2058.24,2060.46, yes sar
2060.76,2067.06, the two shots barbareous together you know there might be a woman in western clothes with them
2067.27,2071.32, when the play and the woman on the common with it
2071.32,2077.02, as is any person even his cousin to his
2077.11,2079.0, aware that the
2079.21,2081.91, a cut the counter shows
2081.94,2082.81, right
2083.05,2087.91, the colors are going to be really interesting on the counter she
2088.06,2090.46, i never went over the shoulder
2094.27,2098.32, because everything in the fun
2098.32,2102.31, it is related as a footfall so that
2102.52,2109.03, so that was the audience are receiving everything and she never wanted you to be outside
2109.6,2112.45, this point of view you are never outside
2112.87,2116.17, at other people talking to each other
2117.01,2128.23, eenamost a lot most soakers their willing to go outside the situation he never went outside it was always
2128.26,2130.45, things at the same time it was
2130.48,2134.56, the audience receiving the information directly
2134.59,2136.3, the drama working
2136.42,2143.29, at the same time you know and the devotional inimical about a sequence in
2143.65,2148.81, any song you know really go out and they look at the sky
2149.05,2151.15, both the drama
2151.3,2157.84, was the drama but the audience is receiving the same inapire information from the stream
2157.93,2162.64, characters looked up at the sky in the stream cuts of the sky
2162.64,2166.93, feel the presence of that space in heaven
2167.05,2172.39, it isn't like you he watching them have a little war experience
2172.66,2179.68, anticipating an april way visually with the same experiences of the characters
2180.37,2182.08, the same time
2183.4,2189.82, so as no one talks about him as being a great climate because there's only one
2190.72,2208.42, for a matter of a illiterate young oleaginous arithelli house in the theater with with the crowd
2208.84,2227.32, the ellersdeane and then appear some cry of crowninshields enters the allotments is unhappy that he corsican by the golf clubs
2228.34,2239.53, the atonement cheeseparing but the point is that like especially especially as i get older
2240.76,2243.31, which is the double line
2243.76,2249.67, this to the two marriages which have to happen right the mother
2250.0,2267.13, that no one was about him as being a great color film that are in man i don't know anyone who made him a greater colour articulated feature you know then then lay the one you know i mean it would be fun to aspetto the smallest series of a great
2267.34,2272.29, now i you know i guess you know you might even do
2272.59,2279.43, thank you was maybe like morning or something the mornings very beautiful as color
2279.73,2290.68, you know a vertigo i laid adumbrating when the anywhere the unwanted into me tell apart with color and white
2290.77,2292.57, he lost 
2292.96,2295.48, to me it makes the truth it 
2295.51,2311.5, for me this with which i easthampstead cover may be notified one other little short singing never got finished that some
2311.68,2313.18, person
2313.27,2317.05, so up the money for his wife was in it
2317.26,2328.63, an unfinished outsider forresti is never shows its great snow twenty minutes along to notion from the middle east and movie star
2329.05,2333.1, wants to get a job and get right
2333.16,2336.97, it's actually the two because it's the producers wife
2337.12,2339.4, he wants to have
2339.46,2343.21, you know we both happening at the same time
2343.57,2351.34, i was in one laterally complete retrospective the archives that really
2351.37,2352.78, we are
2352.9,2357.58, well you know we discussed before the progression
2358.33,2362.44, the colors with the reason the pinyon
2363.01,2367.48, and it's very very interesting you know about when the colors echo back
2368.05,2369.64, you know i
2370.09,2374.26, the things that may be a little obvious conversations learning but 
2374.5,2377.62, you see variations to night you'll see a 
2379.33,2382.18, as a feared something
2382.51,2385.12, a little child sleeping in 
2386.98,2391.33, celsianus someone handing out
2391.57,2395.47, on the street were people and paper out and it's ready
2395.89,2399.73, i was just learning that echo
2399.82,2403.93, i have a caller or away into one return to the color
2405.67,2408.85, there are people who
2409.18,2417.25, i have make a nice color film but there's not that many people actually articulate when the color where the shots and cots are using the color
2418.18,2422.08, another
2423.61,2430.93, i had one at first was making when i was first making films i went very elaborate no books
2431.17,2441.04, all the shops that are have read in the others are all ways to avoid actually making the move you know and so you thought
2441.25,2449.77, young we should have a log of every shot in the story out but now it is i i do zerring
2450.19,2453.34, all aculeata
2453.73,2461.17, i look at a roll of film i get back rolls of film a look at once immediately take out
2461.35,2466.0, shots i want to use and put the other way maybe or check it later
2466.72,2468.91, the forest
2469.18,2471.91, throw it in the door you know a check it later
2472.06,2477.91, at this point it's just very it's very actual i don't write anything down
2478.27,2480.94, first chartered right everything down
2481.45,2483.91, they have the confidence
2484.03,2494.26, it's like a translator in the show what is his ominous night he suddenly got the confidence
2494.56,2497.92, i have to write it down if you just listen and see
2498.01,2500.98, literacy
2500.98,2507.07, i like also you have the confidence you don't have to have
2507.1,2509.14, the extra wheels
2509.65,2513.07, they still have that that was everyone is
2513.4,2527.47, they have these extra wheels on have that any more to do when you're asafoetida like down on
2529.24,2533.8, some of rarities this one bush
2534.07,2535.72, a
2535.84,2544.81, storehouse in san francisco there an arbor retention of willow
2544.81,2548.8, plants from around the world right
2548.89,2550.09, and
2550.66,2553.81, it's a very nice place to go for the camera
2554.14,2556.33, there's this one
2559.06,2562.72, it's actually an english college but we
2564.58,2566.68, i was just in
2567.73,2571.87, i have have atherton were
2572.11,2576.16, a kind of flower that isn't it isn't congresses
2576.85,2578.92, you know it isn't 
2578.95,2580.99, it's actually this little
2581.35,2584.14, and because in canton
2584.5,2596.11, anyway there's a plan there is kind of hard to look at the plan is not so attractive but in photographs really well said isaac plant is
2596.53,2599.44, going to photograph you know because she just
2599.44,2601.3, it because it's a traffic
2601.57,2602.56, you know
2602.86,2604.09, so
2604.57,2609.19, if people are too good looking in a movie it can be distracting sometimes
2609.97,2611.44, you know
2612.19,2615.7, recantation
2616.0,2618.97, and so old noetic but
2619.45,2622.78, yes yes i think just like a painter
2625.12,2630.52, the things you return to you know and another you realize you better not
2630.85,2634.45, having these restrictive in rotterdam and the
2634.48,2638.53, and here and centesimal alive
2638.59,2640.54, a thing to say you know what i
2641.26,2645.58, he said you know i so look at all your films and you go oh i've got
2645.97,2647.77, move away from that
2650.74,2657.13, reverse a seething for geno one were in question it is a pain to it right
2657.19,2659.02, and you saw
2660.76,2665.29, tinyboy fricasseed
2665.35,2667.72, they had a good car
2668.02,2669.94, who are they 
2670.39,2676.36, you would do and accepted as was exploring again without language
2676.69,2678.01, in
2678.22,2681.52, so people i think are less tolerant
2681.85,2685.6, then of course the films aren't necessarily made to be seen
2687.4,2688.54, as
2688.75,2691.57, before our lines at last night
2691.96,2696.16, i find for me it's a very like set of four
2696.79,2701.2, modern art both in new york and they rode in the contract
2701.23,2705.19, only show them as these for in that one
2705.82,2709.84, the reply one of the palatinate
2711.13,2712.9, you know eventually
2713.26,2716.38, after all if one day
2716.98,2724.75, he continued to have been i have no idea i never know at what you're doing is has value beyond the moment you know
2725.11,2728.44, the seasoning like blow regarded or
2729.67,2736.75, i presented him then you can have the privilege you don't have to go to a fishline four of them with three of them
2736.75,2740.59, just look at me to a grating in reading the calm
2741.55,2744.58, would be wonderful but bruce connor
2745.0,2750.31, he sectional his art work and so francisco
2750.58,2753.31, satirist mostly
2753.58,2756.1, does the informers
2756.49,2762.37, he created three rooms were only one film played in each of those rooms
2762.64,2774.88, you know the fifteen so there's a man at the film five tenth of dreamland film had a movie in derbyshire you above that
2775.42,2777.04, really strong
2777.73,2781.69, you seen for ten to demand
2782.5,2792.16, any way so there's only one feminine room and it was very very interesting to be at some one show where you'd have his works on the wall
2793.42,2799.33, then you go into one room and there had been no heavy or blue about
2799.42,2801.19, in projection
2801.52,2803.89, just that one word there wasn't a 
2803.92,2807.91, interesting to see a film show that what i rather film
2807.91,2810.31, the context of a film show
2810.85,2814.57, in the context of that film is in that room
2815.11,2818.17, change the whole relation is very startling
2818.5,2820.9, able to go into a room in that
2821.11,2825.85, you know well interessantes in ten seconds
2826.45,2828.55, the time will come from
2828.82,2832.69, go in and just see the thing that's five minutes in ten seconds
2832.87,2834.13, an art work
2834.55,2835.78, come
2836.11,2841.93, it was very different then if you saw the films like sat in oratorio or three room
2844.21,2850.09, i think well on the formerly have to be shown altogether
2850.27,2852.73, the format now you
2854.08,2857.59, because if you buy there's a pollie
2857.86,2861.79, for palms necessary in one poem
2862.12,2864.28, you know that's fine
2864.4,2868.3, you can put it on atonement er poem
2868.87,2873.04, you know i said because the film show
