12.9,19.47, i've been in the tecendur for like about years now and
19.47,25.38, there's a lot of superlatives that one would clearly use about technology companies and a digital companies
25.47,36.63, a record i think in communications is a little bit more mixed and there's this plenty of embarrassing campaigns that that have been out there over the time that i'm sure well aware of
36.75,78.69, so an epicurean spent the last couple of days helping people with a two day version of his much more famous for day seminaren about the craft of telling stories and we asked them again dessertspoonful
78.9,96.0, and i read once an article by an ornithologist about bird song and he explained in a very different way he said that on a bird is nasty the male bird goes into song
96.06,107.85, hours a day in order to let all the other birds in the area now that he is healthy that he is young and he will defend his nest
108.0,121.8, and if his bird song falters they will then in moments territory and pet him a fucking death
124.53,127.71, after
127.92,135.9, and so as i'm a lot the other side of the coin a
135.99,140.31, each elector 
140.34,198.0, and we've talked for the last couple of days about the art of story the craft destroy the elements history and the relationship but it was for the most part looking at story as a fiction of course and mayonnaise and both and so i thought i would just take a few minutes to day and look at story in relationship and in relationship to what facts and these in lives and sanitation
200.49,204.51, no such thing really a story is just entertainment
204.84,206.94, a matter
206.97,216.3, children's stories hollywood action films etienne of this is in the because every story contains an idea
216.39,228.06, that is raft inside an emotion and it takes ideas and it embedded in two and people irrationally
228.39,244.62, and the story itself may be sound and logical but it is delivered the meaning of it is delivered inside of an emotional experience in this feeling experience and that is why plato orated all the story tellers thrown out of athens
244.74,261.63, he said down these poets are dangerous people they deal in ideas but they do not deal in ideas and a rational logical to a sophic way instead they wrap their ideas from the beautiful emotions of poetry but these are ideas nonetheless
262.08,279.57, they have tremendous effect on people and without them realizing that in fact they are being affected by these ideas and so i want all of these people exiled from athens and the stuffy people like plato are always of course afraid of emotion
279.6,282.51, because ideas can be manipulated
282.99,332.31, as we know every day we turn on the t v o listen any politician open the mouth goweno for a while ideas can be more tabulated but when people get replete with people getting motion then things change and so storytelling as an art form is very powerful for it is in my sensitives powerful way to put ideas into the world and so it cannot be done irresponsibly and it whether a story teller works from atacama the story teller is for better or worse a life poet
332.34,341.88, and that such as i said i come with a great responsibility the story teller's task then is not just to express
341.91,363.36, what life what is but to make it meaningful and emotional simultaneously and to give us a meaningful emotional sense of what it is to be a human being to be alive in the existence and this is no small task because life itself of course is the problem
363.72,382.5, ever since the first pre homespun thought the thought the first human thought the thought i am i came to realize that they exist and suddenly created the famous mind body split
382.5,385.5, life then has become
387.21,397.83, the great problem for all of us because we can no longer live off of our genetic imperatives and but we somehow have to make sense out of this because the next plot
397.92,403.83, after the first human thought i am came the next obvious thought and some day
403.92,405.54, i will not be
406.65,414.99, the realization that in time death will take us all the realization that we are now living in what will be our future corps
415.29,418.95, is both terrifying and of course dreadful
419.01,432.93, living simply living day to day it does not teach us how to live human beings are in fact not manalive human beings were simply made to survive
433.77,438.45, in order to survive the mind than does whatever it means
438.45,462.12, in order to keep itself alive in the mind that is capable of rationalizing any evil into a good and all we need to do once again as entereth ted and we see all the horrendous evil in the world and come to realize to give it any thought at all that each and every person in the world who is doing what we think is evil they think is good
462.36,472.86, probably think it is not just a moral good they probably believe that they are doing a spiritual good that they are doing god's work
475.68,480.72, once we come to realize that when you realize that every one of us is capable of such
481.11,497.97, and that there is no fundamental difference between cutting some one often traffic and cutting them off by the head and the structure is the same there is the desire to do harm there is the action of doing harm and then there is the pleasure
498.12,510.81, the harm that we do as we give somebody the finger in our rear view mirror and smile kay because queesa him a little bit of suffering
511.14,512.85, that is equal
513.75,529.05, we all do it in the tiniest ways but under whatever circumstances we realize workable of doing it in massive ways because we are just human and we have to survive and so merely living within our human nature
529.17,535.92, does not answer aristotle's great question how should be human being the their life
535.92,552.78, and in order to get an answer to that question what is worth living for it is foolish to pursue and once we understand what is worth living for how do we then lead our lives in that direction humanity having invented for
552.84,555.15, the last
555.21,556.71, science
556.98,567.27, and art for grand ways apprehend reality and try to give ourselves the answer to that great question how should a human being lead their life
567.87,570.24, today philosophy
570.72,575.19, who reads contrasts the doesn't have an exam pass
576.93,581.31, religion had become an evangelical joke
582.0,590.49, we see the horrors and that done in the name of religion and always have been done in the name of religion and science
590.55,617.82, in many of them of course are sciences but he was a time that came nineteen century when the world brought the science would finally explain everything the science would tell us the unanswered aristotle's question indeed and for decades people look forward to the day when science would finally give us all the answers but now we know of course as our last week was just pointing out and there with every invention
617.97,629.52, every new gismond gimme the science creates it simply layers of the world with yolante level of toxicity and oral taxis one of the worst
629.76,647.52, and so what is left where do people go to get the answer to that grand question god help them they go to the movies the looking for models of life
648.36,651.6, to understand as i said it is never innocent
651.69,701.4, don't go that just for diversion it's never just for entertainment i mean that's the excuse what they really want is to experience a meaningful model of what it is to be a human being to reinforce perhaps there already a belief that steadily in the good will triumph over evil or whatever under their losing faith in me some go to the story teller and have that reinforced but the point is that they go to the story teller in order to get the answer to that great question in order to experience model of what it is to be a human being so that they can then somehow shape their own existence out of that understanding because the case of a chaos of our days of course simply does not give us what we need a great critic
701.73,709.47, begad the nineteen twenty i'm sure he said stories are equipment for living
709.83,728.13, life does not equip us to live stories do they give us understanding of how human beings lives thrown out of balance how they struggle to restore the balance of life and the consequences of their choices and actions and indeed 
728.25,740.1, story whether fictional effectual where realistic or fantasie i gives life its form story mirrors life
740.85,754.71, story in fact mirrors the mind these men again eprise certainly by science of all kinds of social sciences bosinney and others trying to understand how the human mind works
754.92,765.87, and one grand idea that the understanding that they have achieved the last decade is that the first and foremost story organizes i'm sorry the mind
766.11,768.72, his life as a story
769.02,775.77, this is how we put things together and understand things when we think back when we remember
775.83,786.18, life and try to make sense out of our life how do we remember it as a series of facts as a deductive inductive argument of course not
786.18,813.72, we take it in the create a little story for ourselves a little in sight again even in which things went out of balance for ourselves the struggle we went through to restore the balance how and why eventually the balance was restored or not but we put the past together into a little story the more to understand ourselves and our own existence story is a model of expectation come anticipation of planning for the future when you think toward the future
813.75,877.86, you hope will happen or you dread my happen how do you try to prepare yourself for life you imagine the little story for yourself and coherent story with a beginning middle and end a hypothetical story that somehow then prepares you for life that is just what we do each and every day in order to organize our own life but in order to live as fully and deeply as we can we need great artists we need great story tellers to take that natural human capacity to organize life of the story and tell stories that are brilliantly profound whether they are comic or tragic were tragic comic to give us a deep insight intelligencies has depended upon the story teller for four thousand years much more than four thousand years of written stories since the gudeman who knows how many tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of years before that of oral story telling but the problem is this
878.01,880.83, the story telling has to be of quality
880.98,899.88, every generation has to tell the same fundamental stories over and over in their own vernacular in their own way but to story telling must be true it must be honest it must be beautiful powerful and i somehow because when story telling becomes false
899.91,905.7, story telling becomes weak and a culture life becomes corrupt and decent
905.85,929.46, and by corrupt i do not mean that that word in the political sense of we become criminal i don't mean it in the religious sense that we become immoral i don't even mean it in the original latin a sense that we become simply rotting while all three of those things are certainly possible i mean that life becomes in authentic
929.61,937.71, it becomes shallow there insensitive intellectually and emotionally impoverished
937.71,939.69, a deck of the life
939.69,955.38, a man like a flattened constricted emptied out life due to ignorance addictions fanaticism cruelty greed any of the dark forces that sachant out of human beings
955.38,966.81, and so we need honest in sighful story tellers to shine a bright light into the dim corners of human nature and society and expressed the truth and it is not enough
967.02,979.95, early to express the truth in the sense of exposing what it is to human beauman being but the story teller was tell the story so compellingly and so well that in fact they prove it
980.46,983.82, the audience that the audience is persuaded
983.97,1009.68, indeed of that truth against all the other competitors for truth and it's not enough just to write a book tell the story in a novel the produce a play or film or television show and have people turn it off a cuirasses of them not having wasted their time i mean that's an achievement right there but rather that they turn it off nodding
1009.74,1046.1, thinking yes that's the truth that's how just how ridiculous human beings are that's how magnificent human beings are that's what it is to be a human being and in this regardless of downpours and regardless of of the the medium can simply must be convincing as aristotle said a convincing impossibility is to be preferred to an unconvincing possibility and this is true even of course especially perhaps when you're working from fact
1046.52,1079.67, stories based upon fact documentary and done instructional videos of all kinds stories based upon fact the actuality must be convincing it simply because it is uncontaminated of work the three great methods of persuasion one is rhetoric
1080.06,1091.52, the power point presentation of point point point point fact fact atheistic artistic demonstration demonstration et cetera therefore
1091.7,1136.46, and that that can be very persuasive of course as i was enormously persei don't think i'm going to do the paper folding the but i but i am certainly going to be much more aware of sound and respectful notes of music but of silence because i am guilty of playing music in the background while i'm working too which now that you pointed out really some stupid and so rhetoric is a powerful means of persuasion but so is appeals to emotion and we saw the that there's two ways to appeal to emotion one is coercion
1136.64,1152.72, this is an appeal of course to the negative emotions and people are to various tactics of intimidation threats and bigotry and envy and anger and fear and that saint shall be political commercial
1154.16,1263.36, is what politicians do in order to gain your vote and if they find various means to intimidate us of course and that too can be very persuasive ah the other is seduction which is an appeal to the positive emotions and people through tactics of pleasure giving in association with whatever product or idea that trying to convince a sob and they can show us wonderful pictures sir or sounds of course of nature the scene the mountains landscapes and animals and what not that are all pleasure for us than fact that there's ten various pleasure possibilities and persuasion you can make associations with community a appeals to to family and to belonging to a group in the percolation ship the physical pleasures of course of laughter just having fun good food good wine good times social power appealing to people through their desire to achieve wealth and prestige victory of all sorts with disproportionate greenhouse can be used in various forms to try to persuade people either imitating them or giving them the cinghalese the third way to convince people
1263.42,1266.39, persuade people is to tell the story
1266.9,1283.91, because story incorporates allan story incorporate information but dramatizes the information it doesn't give it and in a logical way doesn't give it inductively would deduct bleat sense but it does give it a causal lodging
1283.97,1330.11, at the same time as that as i said it wraps it the story telling inside of the beautiful emotions of just the study pleasure the emotions of vicarious emotions of the story telling itself a positive or negative the aesthetic experience of the motion is a deep pleasure as any kid who goes to horsethieves
1330.2,1343.91, which is rhetoric winged migration which is pure visual pleasure you know that film just birds lying for ever versus
1344.21,1349.76, that it was no verses talebearers march of the penguins
1349.97,1384.08, and i would argue that more people were persuaded to do something for penguins after march of the pendant then then an inconvenient truth and or waiting immigration because it told a story about little parent and once in the little baby penguin the terrible struggle to survive in the antarctic story persuades because unlike the other forms story admits the negative
1384.35,1460.28, the only way to tell a story is to throw life out of balance rousing a character of the protagonist the desire to restore the balance of life and then they go into haycock with the forces from their own inner lives their own mind body emotions forces from their personal lives friends family lovers society institutions and society individuals in those institutions and the physical world itself and the story that is told dynamic play by moving the character to the negative and exposing a deed all the negative forces in life as an as this character may confront them then turned back to the positive is the character find some means to struggle through those negative forces in pursuit of the balance of life whatever object of desire we cathcart feels to restore the bolt of limerick to the negative and sent forces of antagonism multiplying concentrate in focus and one coontie negative positive negative and as a result some one experiencing a story with the story teller has moved them in that dynamic comes up persuaded because they realized that when people use rhetoric
1460.31,1465.02, they hide every fact that contradicts what they have to say
1465.41,1481.4, when people used to test its they manipulate when people use are all of the various devices even emotional devices are like saxon advertising and what not are they don't bother to show you venerial disease
1483.26,1487.37, they don't admit the negative
1487.46,1508.55, and as a result the somebody sitting there listening to that kind of effort to persuade his thinking every contradictory thought and you may or may not persuade them if you're good and you may but if not they have their own authorities their own statistics their own way of seeing things but story takes people emotionally
1508.94,1530.39, to another person's life and turns them back and forth between the positive and negative and persuaded them of the truth and even if the if the audience doesn't like that truth and indeed the most important trust in life are inevitably bitter true
1530.48,1531.95, and so
1532.07,1535.49, i give my lectures around the world
1535.64,1539.99, order to help people to tell stories
1541.91,1571.34, more effectively in order to express themselves as artist or in many cases to persuade of course the world realizing that that story may be equipment to living as indeed it is but that doesn't mean and at all stories are good and the great danger the course is the people will use the power of story for harm and that there's ugly stories there
1571.46,1591.5, lives this propaganda and the very effective story telling cantell just as readily as i tells the truth and they can wrap lies in emotions just as much as you can rapprochement and that that plato wasn't altogether wrong
1591.53,1624.38, the story tellers are indeed dangerous people and so all i ever do is when i'm done with a lecture i simply say i tell you stories tell them from the heart delesof you know how and then once you finish the story and you look down at it and you ask for its meaning the story tells you its meaning the story expresses how and why life changes and when you understand the meaning of your work the next question i would ask you to ask yourself is and do i believe that
1624.38,1639.65, is this an honest expression of what it is to be a human being do i believe in the meaning of my own creation and if the answer is yes then do everything possible to get that into the world
1639.95,1659.6, the answer is no you don't actually believe the meaning of what you've done then please do us all a favor this is why god gave us the delikhan you all
