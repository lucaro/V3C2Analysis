216.3,236.25, the monitor when the things that has interested me is working with a sort of hiding chaps within other patterns and that sort of a natural thing to be doing with papers
236.37,254.91, a pattern with similar colors but we'll never be exactly the same that i can use in sort of a layered way to these scenes and i end up being reminiscent of landscapes or photographs from space or
255.15,258.72, sort of imagined lies and its
258.72,263.46, that's been a real thing to it for with us is
263.61,269.52, making these things and using them to sort of create a creative use
269.55,283.23, i 
283.26,295.5, legislation the englishman making the monotony the making the monterey just like
295.65,313.14, what happens you are going like a man so penfentenyou sort of failed to mix your ink properly yeastcake all of these light forelle bits so when i am first learned
313.35,332.37, about screamingly this was what i was taught not to do at print pangs that were mixed all the way like the earful to mix the altogether entertaining comes

429.93,449.31, he liked
449.88,502.05, the parapet that told for the owlet line made from the adolphus one haguenin of the oneadatote makes it more obvious when i'm doing when you can see the back with conducting out these elements for another montaiglin memling that back onto the peace it sort of orontides

509.34,544.2, that print making has a natural relationship to animation the repetition of the frames of an animation speak to addition ing within printing or making multiple originals so part of my pittance pieces within the addition as a frame in the animating these frames and that then ends up showing the variation of my hand and of the registration of the piece on the page
544.47,555.99, we live in is a time when things have to exist both in physical space and in virtual space and the way that i treat my animation practice i think is
556.26,603.51, related to that or a product of that in a certain way i painstakingly making these physical objects and then scanning them and taking those physical mistakes and translating them into something that is virtual but feels a little bit more tangible and real readiest really gain opportunity to see something a little differently portal something that you've always heard of felt it pressed in a more concrete way that it definitely another a certain kind of satisfaction that i get out of just
603.57,659.46, having a feeling and working my way around like the things that it estiron that feeling and trying to find something that i feel sort of expressive its presses that looking forward to the future i i really i really idiot the that i'm on in the open and i think it's fermentation is totally important to my practice and just to having a good time in the studio intention just i want to keep making things and looking more closely at the world around me and responding to things and see that i notice
