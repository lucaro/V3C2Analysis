117.42,122.55, we chose and what we could afford was to fill
122.85,125.64, at the very same time 
126.06,130.65, we're being displaced because of the university of illinois
130.71,132.93, what was then called circle

206.61,222.93, i ended up going to harrison when i was in high school i really wanted to take carpentry which that i was not allowed to cairnhope i took pains which ended up being a good thing
223.02,227.22, when i was about to graduate
227.25,235.56, the teacher sent me to find out about a program at college which is now harassing ton college for the the city colleges of chicago

253.62,257.13, well be able to work a scrap so i signed up
258.84,278.25, i have very little of the steam in confidence that i could make it out i know that one of the reasons that i didn't really have confidence that i could make it in college was that a teacher in high school had told our honest class that
278.31,282.84, we weren't going to be able to compete against students from the north shore
283.47,286.83, always tell this story because i want
287.25,289.26, make it clear that
289.35,294.0, though she may have been saying that to encourage us
294.18,297.57, do better words have an impact
297.87,302.73, and those were of never left me i
302.97,309.45, i felt like maybe i wasn't going to be able to compete against these people who are poor i never i didn't even remorse
309.45,314.04, now the students were we were as good as
314.16,324.24, i have been told we had been told in both in high school in an elementary school that we didn't have some of the resources that all the schools had because we were interested
324.24,331.29, it was fine and i was taking again typing and shorthand but also for classes
331.32,336.57, that i could earn a degree associates a bar degree which i did
336.57,341.7, and one i earned that i started to work full time
341.73,355.41, my first full time job was eritance company and i was a secretary to one of the clams managers i would have difficulty be listening to he had other people
355.41,360.36, in letters and other documents in my ears while i was tying them
360.48,372.78, was interesting and at the same time i was doing a lot of reading and you know the vietnam war was going on the gang had taken hold in pillson
372.9,378.15, there was a lot of violence a lot of these going on and i kept thinking
378.75,381.33, the world is going to fall
381.78,386.46, down around me and i nothing to ancus i still going to have
386.67,388.83, at the bone in my ears
388.83,391.89, with this person is telling me that it
393.09,399.45, and at some point as i said i started reading i started reading about the choicest
399.81,408.66, and i also had joined all as organization of lateran students and so i became more aware of what was going on
409.17,431.49, efforts challenges to the way things were especially for those specially for i was asked by one of the attorneys who were here asked the violation said yes then he said where do you live and i said to he said oh that's great you know i have a friend who's got enough
431.67,443.19, raise the epicurus lopez and manual as who had an office a few blocks away from a house as it turned out in eighteenth street redcross the formal
443.46,451.11, so i went there and they hired me and i started working party i started up to saturday and that sometimes i go in 
451.65,462.39, micheline and so when i decided to quit sir insurance company and apply to you is i kept my part time job with raisins
463.02,464.52, and
464.7,467.46, to learn about
467.58,471.12, the other kinds of problems that were facing my community
471.21,474.66, the gangs in the violence but also
474.66,487.83, people being defrauded of their funds the money when i was about to graduate arias me what oniononi said i'm going to redolence a social worker
488.76,496.11, said gowned by nature which i knew because through them i had met
496.11,500.97, the lintons in the state of illinois at that point which were 
502.38,510.09, also in our office was as our elastic who was a lawsuit upon university at the time
510.42,512.46, he was just about to graduate
512.88,521.85, my pastime to texas and meantime day when i started to they had decided to eat texas and so
522.12,525.87, i told my parents that i was
526.17,530.94, plenty to go to law school and they said my mother said
531.0,535.32, wanda you got a school in all you know you for
535.32,540.72, a good job they treat you well i said a iothera me while but iron side of the desk
541.53,544.53, and i realized that there was a 
544.59,553.65, villette just seen the kinds of problems that were facing our community and actually i decided then to
553.74,558.24, the list in my last year 
558.24,572.52, i swore i enough the last and applied to a number of law schools i was accepted both mother and paul and
573.15,582.6, around the same time i also saw a small ad in the newspaper and who is that talked about the legal opportunity scholarship program
582.9,590.55, for minorities students who were interested in pursuing careers in law so i applied for that and
591.39,595.38, you should call detailed
595.56,608.73, your interested he can help you find out more about financial and so i called the entailed hat said i applied in accepted but i don't know yet what to do because i don't have any money 
608.94,612.75, didn't retired from the texas and so i said
612.75,623.1, no no i can do this he said said in your ear oposit it will figure it out we'll find out some will find a way to find you
623.67,629.76, okay without encouragement and i sent in my deposit to paul
630.0,637.32, and then found out that i had got the legal after his sowship programs and that's how i ended up going to law school
637.35,647.76, when i talked to the young students and i always do it if i'm invited if i go to school or community organizations to talk to students because
648.21,656.22, i like when i was growing up and i saw no latigoes ovals i want them to see
656.37,659.19, latinus who have made it
659.34,663.06, who have gone to college
663.21,672.18, despite challenges the spite not having anybody and who has been able to graduate and contribute
672.39,674.46, better infinity
674.61,678.9, and so i tell the students that i went
679.11,680.55, by accident
682.83,686.1, and it wasn't my plan but it was a plan
686.16,692.97, but i also tell them that each time when i thought i wasn't going to school any more 
693.03,694.71, opportunities opened
694.77,698.22, when those windows of opportunity open you have to be ready
698.34,702.9, means that you have to have good graces so had been a good student after school
702.96,717.99, an elementary school my parents make sure that we have books that we at times that we did our homework none my parents graduated from high school so there was that all the children gradually from high school and we all did
717.99,732.3, they really couldn't help because they didn't have these experiences i know anything about college so when i was applying i was kind of on my own i ended up going to legal assistance foundation which also was to both
732.72,740.37, and i was working there when i graduated from law school so i was miniature and i stayed there for a year
740.4,747.06, i had to rotundities to go to national conferences where i
747.39,754.92, the mamertines president general council malamalama legal defence an education fund
755.01,758.52, in fact i had the opportunity through all 
758.82,764.22, to go to the genoese in houston which i believe was 
764.34,770.19, that's the first time i met bill and also assaiboo also listen to try
770.25,773.88, i was really impressed by the two of them 
774.09,779.25, so i would always ask when do we talk about
780.57,787.26, when she would talk about what mathias doing in texas and california i raised my hand and say but what he intends
787.32,795.78, you fly over us to go to washington but we have a huge population and we need go in kind of resources
795.99,802.92, chicago after i was already tense said what are you going to do virginia
802.92,814.08, somebody we have a program called the inter extern program where we bring in young trees around the country and then they become our contact in those areas
814.2,820.53, i ended up going to san francisco which was then the national office for
820.86,829.44, and i spend a year there meeting some of the top attorneys bisection
829.65,841.74, lamented when i came back they gave me a sign to help me said of my own private practice they were able to get some funding
841.86,846.18, a census project in seas
846.63,850.65, at once the sense of project was complete 
851.94,875.1, and we knew it was going to mean that we were going to look at me districting we received funeral several chicago foundations and so mollien the chicago regional office was which was to cover and eleven states region and when they did that i became the first regional councils
875.37,881.64, as i say credible re districting was coming up and so that was our first case
882.06,888.66, the first major cases where the district at a case of the state of illinois and of the city
889.65,894.78, important because at the time the only dialecte officials
897.06,901.08, and lecacheur
901.23,905.01, and i reverence commissioner
906.15,908.49, and we know
908.49,914.25, that the reason we can have any ultimate and corseleted his
914.25,917.1, because of gerrymandering
917.28,921.06, the population grew what they
921.9,929.94, power who had do his tutocanula ion so that we never had enough in one district to elect a person of our choice
931.23,945.0, we opened the office and started working on the issue would hold press conferences and we would meet with the community about designing the map that was more vinerable to us so that we would have an opportunity to elect people or choice
946.05,955.41, if the city council and at the state legislature and saying if you do this we will see he can do this again
957.09,963.09, never been subterranean so they were
963.27,970.11, and what about nobody was about to give up their own power nobody was about to give up their own district and so they
971.25,973.5, in their mass and we challenge them
973.89,977.01, there we were in federal florida
977.31,986.91, so and reverberate turn who i hired and in we brought in the portico leferon friend new york
987.42,997.65, to work with us on the case because we were doing that we have all atheistic including the community which has also been demanded
999.69,1007.55, we really had some block we were young attorneys up against some of the toughest attorneys in the city
1007.91,1009.35, we
1009.8,1012.02, and that was
1012.2,1016.01, i always thought my malignant contribution
1016.25,1022.28, to changing things in the city of chicago i'm not so sure and i'm not so sure i'm not
1022.61,1027.2, it is certainly what 
1027.2,1032.84, for me in the city is where finding the recognized
1034.67,1037.91, power that we should have
1038.33,1044.03, for the power that we did have because we now had a way of challenging
1044.15,1045.08, that were
1045.2,1046.43, to us
1046.79,1049.04, things like germany
1050.69,1060.17, also at the same time during the time i realized that i didn't really like litigation in any case i decided i didn't want to stay there so i love
1060.44,1061.85, and
1063.86,1068.57, to work and a number of non profit organizations
1068.6,1071.57, latitude
1071.87,1075.08, politician when it first opens
1075.11,1077.57, and then
1078.8,1093.92, some point i ended up at whiteladies in mexico i really loved my work there and he also began opportunity to go to the uncompromising nineteen ninety five that was held in vain china
1093.92,1094.82, and
1094.88,1103.58, the lessons that i learned in being here that is always important to have young people at the table
1103.64,1105.8, to be with you as you do things
1105.95,1109.73, second lesson was there's more than one way to tell the story
1110.12,1121.49, then there were all kinds of issues being raised in many many different ways we can never forget that people on shoulders
1125.66,1126.71, and
1128.75,1131.69, her people are families
1133.85,1135.71, mother had a very hard life
1136.94,1141.95, he said that about everybody else but she herself had a very difficult life
1143.18,1147.44, she was put in an orphanage but my grandmother who
1147.71,1150.89, with my mother and my aunt
1151.22,1152.54, they were children
1152.87,1157.52, from texas or emotion he tried to chicago
1158.21,1163.82, here my grandmother it was the depression and i grandmother couldn't
1164.09,1167.78, of them and so they were put in an orphanage in indiana
1168.08,1171.5, even before that both of them had been sexually abused
1172.28,1173.21, so
1175.61,1176.72, her
1179.06,1181.28, but how
1181.85,1186.32, it is strength it is overcoming
1186.71,1189.14, coming things that happened to you in your life
1190.22,1192.23, it was also the last
1193.34,1195.08, and i have
1196.7,1199.19, given and i have
1199.22,1201.41, away to
1203.96,1205.58, not in
1206.12,1207.83, and so
1207.98,1213.53, as there are always people in our lives my dogs
1214.37,1219.05, very strong and very honorable about everything so
1219.44,1222.68, for buonaparte bill sometime
1222.83,1233.6, never in informant and says i know other families suffered in those days and still now and so we
1234.29,1235.25, he was
1235.49,1237.71, so who
1237.77,1239.12, his word was
1240.08,1247.76, his word was important it was truth and so i hear that from him and so i make sure
1247.94,1252.86, i do think to honor his name martina's which i keep the name something to me
1253.91,1257.51, but there are other women who
1258.53,1264.23, i was born a year before i have paid away for us
1264.23,1271.73, viola offer me rainier the first latin layers in eleanor i was the first one to report they were not
1272.36,1275.18, expecting to see me
1275.21,1278.48, think that i have always kept in mind
1278.57,1281.12, that goal of
1281.18,1285.29, in the better for people and pilot is expanded to
1285.44,1295.13, not only wilsonople in general women children i do longer live in milton but i still 
1295.67,1305.57, i can unforgetting to the schools and talk to students whenever a mask and participating activities women came
1305.66,1318.56, there's still a lot of work to do in the city even though now we have but to know elected officials and we have but theatres were still under represented in
1318.59,1320.42, in making decisions
1322.94,1325.73, represented in the universities
1326.3,1327.38, both
1327.38,1332.57, the students as well as the faculty and administration
1332.57,1372.95, the universities of the public schools almost everywhere at one of these said ending as a volunteer is to go to detest a detention center for women and children many of them are most inessential american women and children who are fleeing violence and underclothes asylum which is a right under international law for them to see it we all know it education is keen
1373.34,1376.82, one only in individual growth
1377.15,1384.14, to the movement of our community is so i'd like to stress the importance of education
1384.38,1386.63, in the end the
1386.69,1439.64, i can bring and make my italian make my own distant
