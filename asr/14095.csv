1.23,12.45, so first of all he corduroy from agrarians to introduce to the plan and he patience
12.84,20.1, elementary and
20.43,23.67, britton this man rich
24.09,28.53, to hold up your hand not as some sort of former bird
28.92,30.39, i
30.72,33.96, you're carrying with you a landscape
34.26,37.83, frohman calls had scared
38.37,40.41, on top
40.74,46.53, then the founder of clinton the mind reach rattling her
47.07,60.36, and that man read jehossee of corrugations just as would happen of many of your rooms to reach along the top of your roof and then you butlers of corregio which gone overside
61.62,64.65, primary valleys and primary reges
65.37,67.95, the one goes to the other to the other to the other
68.94,71.79, the land for on your hand
73.17,75.0, he proves
75.45,79.74, a night has it on the foot hills landscapes is that
80.19,82.77, the water that she
83.37,90.6, yes go strong the largest land forms to the incinerated in the smallest blandford
91.71,94.53, my spanish students one said
94.59,96.45, the case
96.78,102.69, for the rights of the riches because what we have here is a situation where
103.08,110.76, sitting all of the water of these landscapes to the smallest components of their constant coldback to the sea
111.36,114.06, i say is the sea
114.24,118.41, in liquid all of the minerals
118.56,120.03, with that
120.39,125.67, the arousing about today we are rid of at the start of the mind reader
125.7,130.26, a lot of the reason of things in our planning that will come from it
132.84,141.87, planting sinsible boy i grew on a property outside of bendigo which was in our family from the alien fifties
142.35,143.34, and
143.4,146.58, property was the melody my grandfather
146.82,149.58, man's talents
149.64,151.62, with that system
151.8,156.3, moving more around and managing all of that for as a child
156.69,160.62, and i can remember doing my first and plan when i was about seven
161.1,165.48, and raisin thrown from weeping because i i can still remember it
166.02,167.91, designed
168.0,169.83, i now
170.1,173.31, always designing every farm i drive by
173.46,181.62, as my wife leicester i should acknowledge her this morning is served that separation is
181.65,186.81, daughter isabella is he a building and morlache
187.17,188.31, myself
190.95,196.86, i went on behind the safe is not a sidewise away in that car evidently
197.31,208.83, because and she said that she got into a car with castaneda the sign is for now
209.31,212.25, i come to landscapes like this
213.51,217.26, excuse my expression this is like a callin were
217.8,219.9, you come and
220.11,223.47, landscapes are just screaming out
223.77,225.12, as
226.92,229.08, the first person to in busy
229.11,232.95, water when arrangements this surface
233.37,236.13, we can actually bring it under control
236.16,237.18, do it
237.18,241.05, a can be under control as well
241.14,248.07, we come to what philothea trying to save her at all has it safe through these lofty his family
250.32,252.78, a door in control
253.02,254.58, like an
255.0,261.66, so much of what we are doing and agriculture was speeding out of control we don't have that control and we
261.72,264.99, but of tried and not in our control
265.32,266.49, dealing with
266.58,268.29, exchanges
268.32,273.75, you know manipulation of markets which so well as to control
274.26,275.64, dealing with
277.08,278.58, gulian
278.64,281.85, dimensionality for control
282.3,287.28, you know i give you a fighting why into that with regard to water
288.12,289.62, a property
291.03,292.26, this 
292.47,298.62, one million delamater fall of rain fall on every square made of ground
298.74,300.12, one late
300.84,304.44, for us to work that out the new imperial tents
306.0,310.17, full of the americans that they having paid for our
310.53,314.07, and they minister when they pay for the revolution
324.36,327.78, if we got two hundred and thirty two
328.59,331.5, of this block of cement
332.07,337.95, he and missus wharton you are fancies the numbers are really big
338.22,340.14, one million
340.35,344.07, and sixty million later
344.07,349.8, so one point one six million layers of water falling on this
349.8,352.59, and the two to
352.68,356.61, length a five hundred mile material of
359.22,364.53, one six billion blazes it soon fathomable amount of water
365.1,376.08, since five hundred liters of water for every square made his elfin riposare i was to have five hundred later take
377.58,385.77, i had a persistent of that i think this last cup would be great or around a predilection
386.1,390.48, of carbonate the soil is really been telling because
390.48,397.92, yet apanta you have in the soil is about our ideas of water that held his carbon is a sponge
398.64,401.46, we don't lack for water
401.76,409.47, but as part of this system superior of the design which served up with low except
409.62,415.95, clarimonde couple of deer on the dining room table
416.31,419.46, stretching this thing out and
419.64,429.81, the water design we went out quite a bit we came up with these figures and we're sort of ideal the time but it still the numbness bubble that this so be
432.0,435.39, we want to do with this property is built to dance
436.08,439.59, total about eight million later
441.57,449.25, i point o six percent of the same amount of water that falls on this property
449.25,453.93, it's nothing it's insignificant in a landscape that is bare
454.05,456.24, this sort of technology
456.24,467.34, i think we've got a few pebbles that are out there that apparently again to be required to be destroyed in order for us to have our appropriate what i would call their appropriate development
467.46,478.77, holding back the case i really uniting in its bizarre that let you know development and palestine take control
478.89,480.03, possible
480.57,481.62, really to
482.37,483.6, had
483.6,494.58, a quick go back for a moment our prices are green platform that i developed a couple of years ago is based on payment
494.76,500.22, sycamores we see developed the nomination is great work
500.4,507.27, cleanse the practice of the development and practice of calantha in it
508.44,509.31, and
509.82,520.77, that pollyanna as being quite amazing and then i took it and and remodelled people in an entering cuticle economic so
520.8,524.07, regilators starts a climate
525.54,535.32, they think that when you come to a landscape that the really what the forms as we define and whenever we may say something first thing we ask is how's the weather
535.47,541.47, right you get when you get right on it socially defines the agricultural systems
541.59,543.66, reduction systems that we had
543.69,546.57, it's the human climate
546.96,548.64, really telling her
549.12,555.0, when i when we look at the climate itself but in the boss baricond being difficult to change
555.09,556.02, i think
556.14,559.98, human limits even more difficult to change
560.19,571.11, these two elements of the top of the platform are the most difficult things to change it for us to change the geography we have the ears those big yellow machine a lot
571.32,573.72, a norman of energy
574.38,576.06, then we come to water
576.57,586.17, there's a big amount of water relatively in a landscape that we like between the topography of a landscape and the climate so much rain falls on
586.17,590.13, where away where it concentrates and for
590.25,593.43, coming in our souls all of us they
593.88,599.88, the the things that we can do to remedy that so that we can practice perennial agriculture hopefully
600.66,605.01, then we come to is where is it fit into a whole landscape
605.43,608.55, because you may to get around
608.55,618.6, do that in a way that's not diminishing in the griding or landscape because rotten to if they put in the wrong place though that they drylands they arose landscapes exeter
618.75,622.11, we come up with ideas others have to get around there
622.62,631.56, look at forestry the gas celebrities as came up with the termagant this from a love armantine
631.62,633.09, all of the
634.44,639.69, silver cast roadstead be just that i should be manassas
641.79,644.43, look at agricultural site
644.55,647.25, i asked position
647.25,654.15, position is a forest is just a matter of what density of forest and when we looking at development
654.24,667.26, putting in different forestry systems we putting notions are putting in sherbets are tooting in wide space systems are we putting in all farming or you know there's lots of different ways that we can assemble
667.44,672.78, that may be natural matey or one that refusal
673.65,675.93, we look at buildings
675.96,678.66, buildings it last as long as forests
678.78,683.43, macdonald a famous ecological architect he said
683.55,689.25, humans are so smart and take a farm for a thousand years to put wheels on like each
689.79,692.37, was the question
692.37,698.01, you know it goes beyond the lithesome take simonetti ings on wheels
698.73,707.07, we got stuck in this place where the generally the infrastructure is what we invest more in than in king else
707.16,708.45, that
708.45,714.48, a lot of agricultural systems put most of their capital expenditure and to
714.48,720.81, construction of very very high cost buildings which are ultimately to generate
723.3,734.01, he is an example of a person who's come up with an enormous amount of innovation about putting pretty well everything on wheels in espouses almost one walentine
734.91,740.37, look at we got abuilding and then we got to fancy
740.67,747.6, the different dancing systems that we have there are so many now and there's more talk about the with the key way tokens
747.63,755.61, and the tendencies or call it some man from chicken caravan and the electric met fencing on
755.64,760.53, fencing systems all for us to be able to manage
760.71,764.37, what a migratory animals
764.37,768.09, my patent on our sentry landscapes
768.24,772.32, agricultural systems are not natural systems
773.16,784.62, we have to do if we're going to make the regenerate is mimic natural systems and the technologies that we have available to us now allow us to do that whether its plastic parker
784.83,792.99, ultimate flexibility get from that reticulation using gravity to the electric fencing systems to wheels
793.2,798.87, all of these things as to practise some sort of sort of bimini
799.68,801.36, from that
801.36,804.6, after we look at fencing is soil
805.02,807.3, a lot of you here
807.3,810.21, i have been your life time witnessed
810.21,820.02, appearance of rocks on your properties or on your neighbor's properties are ever very well as the mexican is a go with a peasant farmer campesino
820.17,826.02, he said to me when i was a child they were so many rocks where all the rocks come from
826.59,830.13, being where also gone
830.46,832.26, he lost altitude
834.42,836.97, and it's called rocky
837.03,842.85, what's happening with harding to wear down the landscape so we're getting down to the skeleton
843.12,851.37, the right that much here and when we get to really all landscapes lacetania way the skeleton is pretty whisper close to the soil surface
851.52,852.93, really careful
852.96,861.78, is diminished very quickly in their fertility but i can fortunately using all of those wonderful techniques that so many plain
862.14,865.77, ticularly last half century
865.95,869.37, we can develop them very very quickly so
869.67,876.27, now we come to the elements that are outside of the bit of yamaskya eminence and that is
877.62,879.78, element of market
880.86,883.65, the grain and in the red
884.22,887.58, it had profitable
888.09,902.01, and regenerative agreeing to have regenerated agricultural systems by godoy profitable people of god be altoun up to work feeling like their value now there's a lot that consarn that of course
902.07,904.98, we need to be able to have marketing systems
904.98,907.23, free in the market
907.26,909.48, it we've got to have
909.69,913.23, markets and actually got a man free
913.89,920.31, that means getting a bit more control the greater the regulators actually supported the common person in that
920.67,923.94, supporting as it would appear
924.75,934.05, really minute number of people who consolatorily get a lot of support the cutacoo person doesn't my find that you know
934.29,936.24, beat the last
937.5,944.82, we get to energy the energy is increasingly expensive were i a hero when
944.82,947.76, at the top of the fossil fuel mountain
949.05,952.08, into get to a point where
952.26,958.32, is going to decline in its cost relative to the prices that we get
960.0,969.06, years time oil will stablish process which will make some of the agricultural production systems that we currently used
969.06,973.17, unfaceable so you are to get on board with that
973.35,976.62, so strategically act now
976.71,979.05, you suffer to samples there
979.35,986.73, it when we talk about energy the most important thing that i like to think about is how can we extend the gift
987.63,992.19, still not being out of the crack the gift of portentous
992.82,995.85, and that i have the longest period
996.24,999.15, that's what i roostem did
999.21,1006.56, we are the gray while we have mister coming out of the sky that he insensate
1006.56,1007.82, one
1008.18,1018.56, any oysters which are carbon rich in soil ten to stay gravelotte of plants in this country a stars enormously gifted
1019.91,1026.21, some active and went to active treatises which will be great or around even though it's not riding
1026.78,1033.32, to systems that we want to say we also want to say all of the tree crop systems joined in and all the rest of it
1033.47,1040.76, i went through that process over a day or two with pilate a couple of years ago
1044.24,1049.28, this long time ago and
1050.99,1057.02, good sense of the old prices that they want to put this property through
1057.29,1063.44, for what i do they want to be generational absolutely lovely
1063.56,1077.78, that's the cloathes property we want to be we want to be you know i read general baculus regenerate him of agricultural creation have extenuation of lilies on this property
1080.69,1090.62, landscape the geography of these property and its interaction with the all of the human etheric in concentration of population like clear and
1090.68,1095.33, all the way down tottering in betty
1095.36,1101.12, we're going to attract with a vespasian areography as well as change the geography
1101.96,1102.71, he
1103.25,1105.83, the first thing that field said to me
1106.07,1111.29, i asked him about what was or said what do you want to see with water the first thing he said to me
1114.71,1122.69, the people talk about getting off the grid with with her power systems what about getting off the great with water system
1123.11,1126.8, about this property and the idiocy
1126.86,1133.04, give that with god pilastered that insubstantial unable
1134.09,1136.16, i think it's concise
1137.63,1142.55, writers probably a twenty miles above a level
1142.94,1148.91, his abilities in registers and any of you would know
1149.18,1151.67, p five hundred odd mates
1151.94,1153.44, the
1153.53,1156.68, from either i was short distance
1156.71,1158.87, unto
1160.58,1162.59, it would unanermous part
1163.07,1164.66, to be able to do that
1164.72,1166.88, we take gone
1167.09,1170.69, the case with these he generally
1170.87,1174.56, infrastructure systems and then might
1175.31,1181.67, all we have to do is just captured a little bit of the water that comes on our property by a rainfall
1183.62,1187.25, for some time and then reticulated it through
1187.67,1189.11, couches of
1189.74,1193.13, use of bostil some plastic fire
1194.21,1195.77, we have to do here
1196.01,1202.64, the unicorn that were somewhat constrained in our ability to do that
1202.88,1213.86, the regulations are set that's something i think that makes to be an ongoing discussion and one thing that regulars are going to have to take a pretty strategic view about
1213.95,1220.1, the really serious about the energy issues and the costs of my you know the one going callosity
1220.16,1225.59, to generate infrastructure well into the future just not possible its bizarre
1227.54,1233.87, the same things that we went through we went through the bad access you know a properly that made
1235.07,1243.2, frequent morganton with animals needs good access
1243.23,1245.18, replied
1245.21,1251.18, in the tent life for war that access is going is basically going along the convenanters
1252.95,1264.26, look at the plan than this plan was relatively easy as ashanti was the cabin what tramontano time at all i had to do was i descried on the riches that was where is that
1265.73,1267.92, divide up the landscape
1268.25,1271.52, with the excess lifelines were going to go
1272.03,1280.55, the excess lines are now the condes conduits for the water reticulations so we've got to intimate
1280.55,1285.02, i put a denver there detectives the border of this roof
1285.23,1289.64, which runs round the edge of this roof that abuse
1289.91,1293.69, the water into those two parts of this ridge
1293.9,1298.04, that water will then be pumped up to the horse point on the property
1299.24,1301.4, lighting
1301.52,1308.63, vide the gravity of water that will be out of the reticulated down through the rich batiste
1308.69,1316.25, working of two in part of which will come with inch and a half for all polypi
1316.28,1319.76, yes he made as a lonely there'll be a plug in
1319.76,1326.9, so you can access mother any point every fifty meters pugilism
1327.53,1332.57, the pressure so will be all the shinansha or rising selves
1332.66,1334.25, i
1334.49,1338.87, that we had how many safe we had how many cattle we martha
1338.9,1351.89, how many chickens we won't have much cross there is to day have any animals we can we fade off that square made of her a die you know all of that then so were allowing ourselves by this to have an extremely flexible grazing system
1353.0,1355.67, with gravity by water supply
1356.3,1360.11, that hasn't been pumped up he using enormous energy
1360.32,1363.8, for out of the sky and a trickle
1364.49,1375.05, the other thing that we've done is that pollnow becomes a fencing let it you've causes learn how is he my job is when you come to properties like this
1375.38,1381.11, it's very very easy and that's the drift of payments caliste
1381.2,1390.65, the other book was called water for every farm and he made the climb and i think it's pretty true that once you learn the carline system
1390.89,1395.06, a tendon and operate their own farm
1395.45,1406.94, everybody should be a designer and with the tools that cost the relates to die and all of the great mapping that we have every where the donatists and a little bit of education
1407.03,1410.0, everybody should be able to design their own far
1410.03,1415.37, it marches it forward and they convey the habit have much more regenerate future
1415.94,1433.7, think we're probably taken up enough time and you probably want to listen to a block from virginia instead of may soon take good look at the plan that i've got and you'll say now that a sort of unredeemed the logic to tell you logic to some of you tetaheite it
1433.79,1441.47, you'll say that we are putting traitrous this landscape and all of that same are returning the savanna
1441.65,1454.76, we got to have water reticulation and we're going to have a lot of flexibility in terms of actions into the future were not cutting off a indisposition will and we're not putting all aversion one basket
1455.12,1464.36, it's i think it's a pretty solid plan for his wonderful couples feature in a really luck to acknowledge michele and filelfo
1464.54,1468.05, latest ship that tie that i despise and 
1468.05,1480.77, really enjoy saying this manifest that in this wonderful event with all of you are lovely people to day i thank you very much
