0.3,34.08, hello my name is russell pressed in brown from abysses and in this to toil i'm going to talk about aerial flight nevers it takes lots of time and practice to achieve success with aerial photography in this project i hope to review some of my favourite aerial maneuvers with the help of aranghie aaron is taken all of the aerial footage that you see in the tutorial let's get started let's go right here to using motion to tell a story but take a look at my first example
34.14,43.59, in this case we have a simple project we have a car the moving were panting with that car and then continuing on
43.59,49.53, show the surrounding area it can tell a nice story of your current location
49.68,52.86, here is another example this was really great
53.07,57.21, notice that we have a close up item here on the left
57.24,60.51, this is a nice way to come in on your shot
60.63,69.45, you're moving in and you also have a person in your shop and the person has moved as you get closer to them
70.17,72.0, another great shock
72.18,99.72, here was another one to consider noticed the car here in the lower right hand corner as it moves into the shot it's not only your camera moving but it's also an element within your shot that's moving many times people will take aeriform and only the camera is moving i find it really helpful to have a combination of the camera moving and a subject matter in your shot moving as well
100.35,112.17, here's another example notice all the sun is a lining with the lighthouse in this case to start the shot then as you slowly move in on the shot it moves off of the lighthouse
112.44,130.77, and extends out here over the ocean a really nice way to tell a story about a location and an added bonus of planting the sun right in the middle of this white house in this next shot we're going to talk about dolly crane and gibson
130.8,136.29, now in this case we can do much more than a dolly crane and gib because we have
136.65,142.68, more of a three dimensional movement here we can move up and forward
143.04,150.39, and then start to rotate as removing forward it's a complex move that involves
150.39,161.19, several different motions at the same time and once again notice that we have are actor or character in this shot which adds another element of intrigue
161.7,163.02, try another one
163.14,189.87, in this case no show the camera holds still moving backward as our subject matter moves forward this is a really nice combination the reverse motion with the forward motion again adds a lot of intrigue not to mention the fact that there's a dog in the shot and it so important to have a really interesting subject matter like that
190.86,192.33, check out this shot
192.33,196.02, in this shop the camera is moving back
196.2,199.74, and the truck is moving toward the camera
199.89,202.77, then the camera starts to lift
202.8,226.05, revealing the surrounding area i really love the way the truck moved out of the scene and were now casting our interest more for the surrounding area than we are for the truck the truck was a vehicle to bring us into the shop and then the surrounding area is revealed a really great technique
227.01,251.85, now let's talk about the establishing shop in this case we're going to point the camera in a direction that really is in descript we don't know where we are but we slowly turn the camera rising into the sky to reveal our location twisting around we also see the small human figures in the distance which gives us a sense of scale
251.88,280.74, not to mention the fact that the time of day that i was shot is casting these beautiful shadows keep that in mind when you go out and photograph the time of the day is so important because the shadows define the shape within your imagery here's another great reveal again starting pointing in one direction turning in this case and we know instantly where we are and again the time of day
281.1,285.54, next the god's eye shot
286.02,299.4, this is a great shot i love the ability to get these types of photographs with the small aerial vehicles as we start the shot we see the scale figures in our shot
299.46,300.78, we move up
301.59,322.5, we moved forward and the camera starts to point down then the camera slowly points up to reveal the sun a really nice combination of story telling and tis god's eye view combining them all together it's a three dimensional motion through the scene
322.74,329.4, his another god's eye view its classic just pointing the camera straight down on your scene
329.61,337.65, in this shot i wish there were some really nice shadows to define the height and shape of these barns
337.71,346.83, but in this case it worked out well because there's a beautiful pattern on the ground you'll be surprised and amazed what
346.98,351.81, image will look like from the sky as you directly point your camera down
353.85,355.29, another shot
355.56,364.74, in this case we're going to have a revel combined with a god's eye view were revealing this
365.4,372.48, formation to the right and the camera is now going to start to slowly rotate down
372.69,375.57, and point directly down
375.57,376.89, our shot
377.43,384.51, this is a great combination of moves moving up and then looking down keep that in mind
385.44,394.62, the revel now this is really striking the reveal is a slow process of lifting
394.98,417.39, in this case moving forward or pulling back to reveal your surroundings it's a simple move with in many cases one direction there's a slight tilt down of the camera in the shot which adds to it and the lens flare coming into this image is a really nice plus let's take a look at this one
417.45,429.78, this is a classic shot it appears to be just as simple panorama but the camera is pulling back and this shot was actually photographed with the camera
430.14,442.89, moving in reverse the copter is flying backwards the advantage to this is that the blades are tilted up and away from the view of the camera
442.89,464.22, so there are tilted up enough so the camera does not see the blades in it a great way to photograph a scene like this with a pull back instead of a push forward if i were to push forward and fly into the shot i might see my blade but again a fantastic example of a revel and a very easy shot
464.43,465.66, achieve
466.56,479.58, the chase in this case the camera is following our subject as you see here through the woods now it gets a little bit difficult and the flying can be very very difficult
479.64,491.22, because of the trees and the fact that you could almost hit the truck in this case but again a great technique to chase your subject matter through a scene like this
491.37,494.88, now the closer your subjects are to the camera
495.03,498.21, really makes it much more interesting i find
499.38,500.64, look down
500.88,521.01, now the look down similar to god's eye but there's a motion involved and this is a classic example here on the salt flats the motorcycles coming toward us and then it leaves the scene it comes in it stays into the scene and then leaves and then here we have this beautiful
521.01,523.26, of the sort at
523.41,525.0, straight down
525.15,527.1, as we closed the scene
528.36,529.68, another one
530.1,536.46, in this case it's in descript we don't know where we are and tell the camera starts to move back
536.64,543.75, we're going from this flat two dimensional image to more three dimensional view of the scene
543.81,546.18, pulling back even farther
546.27,554.43, reveal even more detail and we get the grand feeling of the height and dynamics of the scene
554.7,556.83, incredible next
558.15,562.32, in this case the camera is moving up
563.58,569.46, over and then pointing down into that god's i view
570.3,587.64, the second helicopter in this shot of course that's me flying there and this is arranging the really great shot as i learned to fly down below again ending with the gods i view starting with depend up your subject
587.7,591.69, keep all of these in mind as you go out and photograph as well
591.99,594.78, next let's talk about the circular shot
594.96,598.11, as you can see in this shot
598.11,604.26, camera is moving forward were pushing on the joy stick with the forward motion
605.04,614.49, so rotating the camera with the jar and the left hand controls to radio multiple joyce ticks
614.58,619.5, controlling in the age like this at the same time can get very complex
619.62,621.93, but take a look at another one here
622.62,624.63, again moving forward
625.32,627.15, rotating the camera
628.05,630.36, fly around a subject
630.48,635.94, practice this on something smaller than a huge massive rock
635.94,654.27, and learn the process of flying around something and maintaining the subject matter in the centre it's not as easy as you would think it takes a lot of skill to pull us off and only someone like arngrim could do this as accurately as this
654.27,665.88, he's done a superb job he's not always keeping it in the dead centre but i think there's some interest in seeing our subject matter move throughout the scene
667.05,669.57, here the reverse shot
669.69,680.91, there are actually occasions when you have to photograph something in reverse to make it look good in the ford motion as you see in this project so what we're looking at
680.91,697.89, appears to be a flight through this opening when in fact it's a flight in reverse the reverse flight was much easier because we first went through the small opening we knew our path and in simply pulled back on the joy stick
698.07,714.27, to achieve a perfect flight through it but in fact in this case we needed the flight to be in its reverse mode we wanted to fly through it so it worked out well keep that in mind when you're working on projects reversing the video can often help
714.39,717.9, a point of view shot will end with this shot
717.93,732.18, it's a really nice way of moving the camera in the point of view of your viewer and here at the height of an average human it looks as if your moving through the forest or some one is walking through the forest
732.3,750.66, okay there you have it that was a review of some of my favourite aerial maneuvers practiced some of those maneuvers and use these techniques in your next video production special thanks to aaron grimes for these incredible aerial maneuvers shots that are used in this tutorial
