0.06,118.62, are standing at times square where you see a lot of activity to hear a band playing behind me i can see people sitting out having a pope chatting catching up a friend and it sometimes natural even in a cold blustery winter day her words for i the reason her city and while he is at commentating sat when he happened a couple of years ago because there was a euphrasia in this great attraction that people come from all around the world to see was pretty much dedicated dorcas it's important to remember that his much as some people drive that feareth half a montenotte for drivers bicyclist for pedestrians and for poker age for young parlor in between one way look at people that are orientating and people that are working a city managers there beginning to think differently about how cities function and then not thinking that the highway is terribly important for central business disturbs it's okay to keep a couple of high speed roads like the brigantines to keep us moving round boatport of the cayote other but it's not okay teton every one of our streets with that purpose so the work they are cities doing in spots like this is helping to bring back more light to the street and the rest of the neighborhood rottenton that are moving toward isaachar also got a benefit the first thing to note is that this is not just a bite waitstill i call complete street design we had other wide avenue at five lindendaal red and they were twelve feet wide lane so rather than take out a lane
118.62,121.95, we just kept the same number of lanes but made them
122.07,125.04, narrower which is the side benefit
125.46,154.59, down the traffic ouave before the bike lane was an used to be the width of the highway is often even sometimes still like a grand free out there but the bikaneer islands make it so much easier to cross the stream there withall oasis till you can see that people will come right through hersebom through an he got away because he's going through the islands and wait for the pedestrians to pass so really is helpful for
154.77,178.59, maybe carriages and strollers elder people with walker in a wheelchair you can observe them on the street stopping in these islands and taking a breath before moving on and i saw that there was going to be a whole line of parts cars between me and my bike and the traffic i was really quite ecstatic before the lands i would have avoided columbus avenue because they're too many huge trucks
178.74,199.32, now now it's a completely different story i could ride capablest two thirds of our south commune by bike every day into the store and so it's only help them get to and fro more havana by lane there intellectualise at the livery guy
199.68,245.46, i used the wonderful yet her mother i think especially for the bakers and when i heard of the community warming but they need a safe place to ride and we then like i said all for it and we think it's great all over vendors have been able to get here on materially have a huge problem with parting as an affected our ship and we have a bustin front of the story anyway so we have always had to be cautious about hardship men are coming in and out of the store and racially very soon will be planting trees and flowers in these treaties in its way for the community could become involved and the planting instanter amenity in an unexpected outcome from the likeliest in second avenue on the side of an at
245.52,259.59, an attempt to really change the street we've got a dedicated bus lane we've got a dedicated bike lane we have some thelma protected the goal here is basically to create a street that is more friendly for pedestrians
259.68,301.95, more friendly for bicyclists and that is more friendly for traditional car uses as well as commuters who commuted by boss i think complete streets are really important reshaping of the streets so that they reflect the number of people that are being moved by each more busses move a great number of people so pervading and dedicating a lane for busses makes a lot of sense i take this select us over there originality when they said they were going to get a lover to that would come up and down these avenues quicker at obtaining on faster
302.07,330.39, he commuted by walking to and from work than anywhere else in the city the intersection just north of here is one of the most dangerous intersection in this entire corridor and some of these improvements are intended directly to make the intersection safer for pedestrians by love the island this the traffic coming out from here and they can't just sumurun they have to wait for you you more time to cross and there's not a lot of time on this light here
330.72,370.41, so it's hell i sport the prospect park west redesign neither it's a great example of a community driven project community board asked for it both to reduce speeding and contradictoriness and a great safe place to bite and to make prospect park west safe for all its uses a intelligent early two thousands we had a big push for traffic coming at the same time the bloom burgermeister ion was moving toward adding by fits when i came to prospect park west it seemed a perfect opportunity to combine the two to both narrow it was a three line
370.41,381.9, a race track essentially while providing a very important link in the bicycle path system around the city so the unpretentious committee you know jump on that
382.05,441.42, and felt that it was worth while project lattimore park west have reported to me that before it fell to them like living on a speed way i drive and i remember you know you and out of those three lines and there was something fun about it but it was dangerous at i think folks who drove it knew it and folks who live there felt it rode like this by slowing down the motor of speeds from about just under thirty five miles an hour to just about twenty five miles an hour that begins to make a dramatic increase in pedestrian safety for lotions cars are more likely to yield to them cars the stopping distance is shorter once they spot of adhesion in the roadway and even in the unfortunate incident of their being an impact the likelihood of severity is less of the slower speed for the project in into effect were the three quarters of cars were speeding and now notify
441.87,451.05, even without the bicycle path i like the traffic common we lavalike i out here a light with my boy and we live in the north slope
451.14,460.29, it all the way down to burlesque then we cut into the park and we hit the sacred and the best thing about it is i can get home now i never used to be able to get home
460.32,466.35, now we have a two way bike lane so it's safe both direction just very calm and
466.95,478.47, it's very civil life i didn't have to write on the sidewalk like i used to i actually felt safe i didn't feel like anything was going to hit me and other bicyclists were
478.5,485.28, being the traffic signals and stopping when they were supposed to stop i'll tell you that as a cyclist and as
485.31,661.41, his walking his dog while the time i like the new design it slows down the neighbourhood and a beautiful park textually designed streets fantastically important that we find ways to make our communities more accessible to all the people who want to use them and allow for kind of testification and a more sustainable in the amreeta in immense we dissipated as having the bilander drammer people into the stores because it is more accessible to sergeant motivation it just brings out even more people to walk for people who like our people don't get in a car a carnot madame very useful but i think the changes are better for the city i think it promotes people to be healthier we need people to be healthier than potentiality that is friendly to more than just automobile for people to become a customariness of this new way were also beginning to street we saw in our great neighborhoods from fifty sixty seventy one years ago and this is important because it helps make the local economy for by rademas the neighborhood or in rich but also it returned people to be ability to walk and by around people half townshend's problems for people who live in the area who have cars there may be a convenience but i think you have to sometimes trade of convenience for safety and safety is toronto the most part would be to look for is a story a story that thinks agoing well just as i make it so the headlines but if people are complaining and people complain about almost anything it will get itself into the newspapers but i can tell you from my point of view and in the dear abbe of traffic at the driver hastain they will write to lucy i have been getting place no pains about her second apostolic about the ninth avenue ariamenes so how the drivers seemed to be adjusting to it i think we're moving aluminous wetmore even seen the lifting lithotomist mortified say the bisons the cars the alligators not to just step out because you see an island here and when the lights against you is very important people
