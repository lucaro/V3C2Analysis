20.88,22.92, introduction
23.22,28.89, talking about fusing of physical and social centers for situation awareness
29.07,35.85, the two parts of the top one in going to quickly given over to you some of the work had done earlier
36.09,45.0, and then i want to go in the more detailing to one of her very recent works and this work has been done in collaboration with
45.18,51.57, one whose my perdinavititis right there is almost finished fastening the dog market 
54.54,60.66, below this is the idea big data and i would say big sense data
60.66,64.29, a lot of pipe of senses that are cameras that affected
64.44,67.65, you know there are all kinds of you know
67.68,71.88, and a low sense of the all generating data
72.36,74.52, i would also say
74.67,77.37, that is lord of 
77.91,81.12, entertained by social sensors
81.12,84.51, sinners are basically human beings
84.78,89.34, the poetical optical example of a social censor
89.34,93.51, a human being who observes something of interest and tries
93.96,97.41, this is example and would be used for of my world
97.86,98.91, and
99.81,103.68, i do in our work
103.89,108.54, can we use observations from physical censors
108.75,118.41, and cause these observations by social censors and can be merged them together in order to get a becrusted of what's going on
118.44,120.18, that's the whole idea of the work
121.83,123.36, and
123.99,126.84, really the motivation is that
126.93,130.98, if something is going on so this is the map of manhattan
131.16,135.39, i've been a bit chosen when interest is actually the
135.45,138.03, william on the streets of manhattan
138.57,145.5, so if there's something going on a foreland it is observed by a camera
145.77,147.9, on one of the streets
148.26,151.5, if it is interesting enough event
151.8,156.87, maybe somebody out dead in the streets would read about it
157.29,159.0, the question is
159.33,162.27, these are too very different perspectives
162.36,163.68, the same event
163.86,165.84, by a camera
165.96,167.61, kind of low level
168.06,173.4, and the other is by a human being whose objurgating and consuming of interest
173.55,177.39, and the project somethingorother something about some kinds of 
178.32,179.82, as we
182.67,192.6, he combined his information so that we can infer what going on the back then just using the physical senses or just using social centers
196.62,198.57, fine
199.11,204.66, so we can be an try to gauge the accuracy of the deduction
204.84,207.93, and began actually run experiments
208.02,211.11, just using information from one set of senses
211.17,212.85, see what is that curacy
212.85,216.45, the other side of senators and the combined and senators
216.99,221.1, yes i wanted not this is quite a day
225.96,229.17, challenges of this one is that
229.2,232.65, then what the kind of senses have the old limitations
233.88,239.19, of the physical senses have lumbering along at could be fixed
239.49,243.63, it is pollution and it would be pollution by disappearing of senses
244.11,256.65, the other hand the societies give up symbolic information because they will devitt what we on and then give them interpretation in usually language using tact
257.61,260.25, also the different densities
260.4,262.62, in the sense that
262.86,274.83, as are very sparsely located they are not enclosed but a civility there are lots of steaming with thousands if not you know and of thousands of people in manator
275.25,279.33, all of them could retreating so there's a lot of trees were not 
280.11,285.39, the other hand so that by the speculative of the social and cerisier in edifices
286.05,289.32, the unpleasant physical sense is higher because
291.33,293.7, putting the scene continuously
294.03,299.97, the boasting or a blow the video continuously on the other bank human beings
300.0,303.36, except a few rare exceptions to the continuous
303.51,306.96, they would treat when they are interesting
307.56,311.76, also there's a lot of noise for opinion media
311.76,317.55, because you are in front of a periwinkle about peradventure anything
317.64,321.57, you have no constant and what you and so there's a lot of noise
322.02,324.15, a dog of censors
324.24,327.57, it could be a sense of purefoys censor
327.6,333.72, in the of camera that would be justice be haze they could be raindrops if it's raining or snow
333.72,336.42, that would be to rise operations
336.51,340.71, you know senses have their own problems
340.8,343.35, and the whole is by combining this
343.38,345.78, or computations of each one
347.85,354.99, so i first work actually was what god treating abrasive this is a slightly rigid work
355.05,359.13, all present at first in the albacore in
359.88,362.25, the idea was this
362.43,364.32, traditionally
364.56,369.63, the camera actually always boasting
369.66,374.19, regis which his exaltation information
374.7,376.26, we actually
376.5,378.75, have combined
379.23,381.24, potentiality
381.42,384.54, treat when at something interesting happens
384.66,385.89, man be
386.01,388.38, we want that creating cameriste
388.59,390.57, which have a bunch of timber
391.83,396.81, teetering or disparage the traffic jam
396.84,399.12, you know
399.21,402.09, interesting happening then it would treat
402.36,404.67, and rather than sending out a wide
404.97,407.88, then can be used this information
407.88,427.56, original work so we actually came up with militant have treating cameriste as if the cameras to so we took the information from cameraman
427.65,436.8, a concept detector too to find out if i can decompose in the wide sea like really copple but a car now
436.86,438.54, the night
438.6,441.18, then it would basically would
441.18,444.69, simulating the henriette the concept good
444.69,446.34, and we
448.89,450.42, what would his
450.51,458.49, the musically used a conception of the shell considering like butaritari
458.52,466.44, the catering reiterating the camera and then we could aggregate recommendable cameras
466.98,468.27, also
468.3,474.18, then use trees from human beings near the cameras and the combatants
476.49,487.68, so so then began we can actually do something that ananias depending on what you are often interesting on the location you can do some kind of faltering
487.71,496.47, then you could to sign and then combine it with crosspieces music come social information and then complete
498.78,508.65, so this is how roughly out deleeberate we used a conception and the many standpoints of lebensbilder
508.68,510.69, the whole idea is the following
511.17,514.8, this would be one of the camera men had
515.13,516.9, and if
517.89,522.57, this cumbersome the scene in it i observed the street scene
523.56,526.77, then you lied the conciliators on that
528.21,537.72, then it would be at several concerts astounded point nine but with indication of those fine fine
537.81,541.59, then we could take the same concept from there
542.31,543.39, then
543.6,545.13, do i
545.52,547.08, i would treat
548.16,552.12, he now made it percentage crop
553.59,555.21, then you can imagine
557.19,559.92, treat of the camera
560.76,565.65, imagine it has a bunch of other cameras and there's a coward and
565.68,568.98, the humans another and who pretend
571.47,574.35, the peterboro and similarly
574.92,579.42, the humans would have won or been treating about things for one of the
581.46,584.34, what sort of a human
584.4,590.31, what we could do if we could take the tree or so below the location of the camera
590.73,592.08, and
592.47,595.14, of the trees are cut
595.26,598.8, we can figure out which had that treats being
599.55,602.07, from that camera
602.31,604.44, we could gather those treats
604.5,615.6, the catalysis we could go to actualize you know we can do all kinds of moralizing molestation and all those
615.69,617.97, singleton
618.09,623.43, then figured out what at the salon you know words are there between
625.56,626.52, then
626.61,628.2, i
628.71,636.15, interesting about a situation it means we are interested in what's going on during a certain time will so let us sum that time were
636.54,644.79, we do apostolate all so we could collect the treats sake if you are interested weintrauben
644.94,648.9, actually colomal the trees between riparian
649.14,650.52, for to day
650.76,656.97, then we can also look at all the treats at retention that same location
656.97,659.91, yesterday did before said they would have been of time
660.18,662.64, you can imagine it of the set
663.66,666.63, from all those streets and documents
666.81,673.11, then we can do tricks from usual exposing an do a pear for ideas and of
674.13,678.9, and that is his and we can find out what other salentines people are packing about
678.99,682.26, the location so we can get work on like this
683.7,687.72, we got this information from
688.02,689.19, human
689.97,700.92, in mining reposed to mining and be converted the video captured by cameras into trees by doing concentration
701.01,704.37, we got two sets of treats and now what you're going to do is
705.06,706.44, actually combine
706.86,717.03, just so the results because the work on how we do the combination was actually presented in this conference is by a two days ago on
718.26,724.26, it that is also were actually collected collectedly levantine cameras all over mantel
724.68,727.23, you can wade
727.29,728.64, the 
728.73,730.53, also collecting
730.74,731.94, from there
732.3,733.8, it's a lot of data
734.49,738.39, and and what would it is a
739.35,741.33, look at certain
741.48,744.03, he went when
744.03,747.45, we got this information from
747.84,749.7, but
749.94,759.93, he put about because they give a placidities and also that you know put out information to be new
759.96,763.14, even happen to a good for our experiments
763.65,766.17, so if
767.16,777.69, one particular the surcoat we did this in manhattan bilateral cameras you the pictures and bedington and detection
778.02,779.01, then
780.54,783.39, i roared
783.66,789.06, on the cover and elected all the creature came and then wetted the amens
790.08,794.7, and i know a kind of play a short radio which we chose a
794.7,799.62, at one particular event which was in december fourteen
799.62,801.54, a million people march
801.69,806.64, and what a wonder whether show how
806.88,808.83, combination of the
809.13,815.13, tweet from the cameras and the trees from the humans a combined together
815.22,823.62, and you noticed it mitternacht come sometime somebody atimetus
823.65,824.97, then the riot
825.81,829.05, and of indian impair
829.32,832.14, i 
832.98,844.17, a kind of start of verando are treating about a million or marcionites to case the word lowenstein
845.49,847.74, you can move up in the canton
854.7,857.94, i think the number
858.06,859.32, fourteen
862.83,869.43, a million people in it's not population within menatonon everyday
870.18,878.07, and battering which are not relate and this is just the most important to so it was a million
878.1,882.21, what was interesting to us was the schedule yes most 
884.94,890.85, so a very good question you're ever looking for the panic so we were mining from there but
890.91,897.75, in general if you did not well looking for anything then you would look at all the important things which people are talking about
899.31,904.59, on what your application is what your interest what kind of situation are you interested
906.6,913.23, it could be anything i mean what you like what are men so we actually disport of the system 
922.35,923.76, yes
927.24,930.48, so we were interested in this particular experiment
930.51,936.69, just ratified that this is actually useful so we're looking for some events which are prepared
936.99,947.19, and so what was interesting is we've picked up if you look at one of the tabellion people maester's something calsobisidine which with two of
947.46,960.36, at the same time the belgian people makes going on there was a march of sanatorium here no other because there was a sand upon french which which which i of decamp in our data
960.6,964.71, interesting but as surprising to us it was
964.95,967.65, this is the work done earlier
968.85,978.72, i do too on that i really want to focus on the middle fantastical notions and because she beateth cameras and
979.86,983.58, we got ambitious so why stop at
983.94,985.89, treating cameras
986.07,991.38, you can have the same notion as a notion of treating censors
991.41,998.91, physical censors in croaking physical greetings you can interpret them and you can have treating sensors
998.94,1001.04, so if you wanted to generalize it
1001.28,1004.25, why we started the piecework
1004.37,1013.55, and again the physical senses and he ever interested last year are behind a huge problem of his in singapore
1013.73,1021.05, basically there at his logging companies which were in force in indonesia
1021.08,1026.15, huge fires and all the smoke comes on personal
1026.21,1031.58, and a big problem and member of trevethick you're lucky the 
1031.79,1042.89, transitions presents so so so there is a pollution orientations in in cigar and people when there is a people to about a
1043.07,1051.44, i wondered to combine the pollution information from this pirating stations and the trees about the hat
1051.62,1053.45, not
1053.78,1060.2, i say the physical inspiration information then can explain the readings
1060.32,1062.0, like mining
1062.33,1064.94, understand situation in 
1073.73,1077.72, less inaccurate just in many
1077.75,1083.66, but not more accurate but it gives a better semitic sent on what is going on
1083.99,1086.42, and people affected by it
1086.51,1089.03, people treat when it bothers them
1090.59,1096.74, and we found that certain areas people tired more and certainly less people to that last
1097.19,1103.4, and we also found that there were no pollution monitoring stations all over in a poor uniformly
1103.52,1104.51, we
1104.66,1109.85, what we wanted to do i can be informed pollution reading in places watermains
1111.02,1114.08, people are getting about it what the feeling
1114.23,1116.06, then can be used
1116.18,1121.01, in by doing this inference to that the motivation
1124.46,1125.84, it was not
1125.9,1129.86, what ado is
1129.92,1132.95, we take a particular type of indoor
1133.52,1137.75, this is a presentation satisfaction in window
1137.75,1142.19, and these are the different locations of the senses
1142.31,1147.56, the location could be read the camarista or it could be a pollution measuring station
1148.73,1152.66, and then i often
1152.96,1157.19, we have a cat about what going on up
1158.06,1168.77, now we want to combine this information and we want to use mathematician to which means that we take this man drinks of missus taine went low and his other different locations
1168.77,1177.98, you might have unheeding of the senses or if it cameronians for which were of licentious and the confidence by use of the cocoons
1178.34,1181.91, and then we can actually sacristan to
1182.09,1186.41, she will be an actually inspired by things in recommendation systems
1186.47,1194.24, you have the useless and the adoration systems and then you actually factors into the use of latin
1194.3,1201.68, i don't like actors in order to get a better understanding of recommendation so you are can have temporal letter factors
1201.68,1206.27, special letters and an election as we gallop
1207.44,1212.96, let's imagine so this is the same grand
1213.14,1221.66, these are the kinds and let us sotherton sense to his adoration mesopotamia grammarians
1221.81,1226.7, and this and then as certainties the redressing
1226.76,1232.16, it could be no and his attire location so so we have a second signals
1232.4,1236.06, locations and in different insteps
1236.51,1237.92, also
1237.92,1244.67, at the same duration we have the social inattention documents say animating the mistress
1244.76,1245.99, there
1246.08,1248.75, he won't be plebeian
1248.81,1250.28, three
1250.37,1260.72, consists of a post on the bones of different words and the world below to edouard
1261.53,1267.38, it do it we can do a topic and allies on this social documents
1267.5,1272.21, understanding what people are not what topics are people talking about
1272.3,1279.86, then he tossed from the senses in them and then we want to combine with the information in ivery principal man
1282.26,1289.52, what we do is so this is our basic model so this other times and this is the location
1289.55,1291.59, aristion
1292.07,1301.43, in the fact that scientists the very standard of apprising because one olfactories if you might have liked that you get the bayou reasons
1301.79,1303.26, he
1303.26,1308.15, which is by much isokrates the estimate
1308.33,1318.41, is your landerirette patriziato might order a dissertation of the lateness of the number of letters
1318.86,1326.87, so the indwelling that is as you have avenues for the inductions
1326.99,1329.0, to this
1329.18,1330.98, one is
1331.04,1337.28, after leguminosae may retaliation to and you want to minimize that
1337.46,1340.58, and materialization
1340.94,1345.41, and it is bad that then to a fact this
1345.92,1351.53, into latin factors the latin temperament special a detonators
1351.83,1356.12, the best representation of that situation out there
1356.33,1360.68, this is just the physical signs we have not just that social dignity
1360.83,1362.81, and
1363.47,1373.37, so in objective function we anatomize this estimate of the sensual value
1373.46,1376.13, a signal
1376.16,1378.08, subject to some
1378.89,1381.02, so then what we do is
1381.02,1386.21, now a into the minimization fortune something of the social
1386.84,1389.78, this is how we bring in bringing the social side
1389.96,1392.84, as i said we have this 
1394.82,1400.16, he collected at that particular time around that particular sense
1400.43,1402.08, the social documents
1402.83,1404.24, it
1404.45,1407.09, and adam
1407.66,1410.0, antoniello
1410.12,1412.07, location
1412.64,1416.75, the situation yet in the monitor the pollution situation
1416.96,1422.99, so the pollution situation is being measured by this physical sense of the psi
1424.76,1425.9, so
1426.02,1427.79, people putting a lot
1428.09,1429.08, and
1429.17,1434.27, i accuse some of the great people are treating about is about the pollution
1434.84,1436.37, to understand
1437.09,1439.67, and one held the other
1439.73,1441.59, to get a better understanding
1442.01,1444.17, social what we do is
1444.38,1452.6, imagine an idea mother you're to understand the topics the topics are basically a distribution around words
1452.69,1454.79, the words botherments
1454.88,1457.88, basically bringing
1457.97,1460.28, the fact that the social factor
1462.35,1465.47, the more of the other
1465.74,1470.24, the trees around those particular locations of the senses
1470.6,1477.05, we can have a big envisioning a jintleman mice this are
1478.04,1482.81, activation that means you want to get the facts in such a way
1482.81,1484.76, explains
1484.85,1487.16, the best explanation
1487.19,1495.47, for the physical readings at that place and also in the best expedition for the social documents for the topics of the
1495.98,1500.0, so this is a nice of the netting or the physical and the social
1500.9,1503.48, effectively what we are done
1503.51,1504.92, then
1505.07,1514.46, the nations the censor realisation for for i bereaven locations and the gear
1514.58,1518.3, the topics of the
1518.63,1520.58, drinks
1521.03,1524.3, that time at all those censors
1524.3,1539.0, i want the egotistic tion and then juanito the apparition when you want to minimize the physical daring and reinterpretation and also maximized the social observations like good of those as
1541.91,1545.6, and by doing this we have actually done the fusion of golden
1546.68,1551.54, and what is nice about it is one you have done dear
1551.66,1552.68, then
1553.19,1555.86, and the politician
1555.95,1568.82, since advising that meant in one part of singapore you did not have a measure in station for pollution but if people treated around there to could tylette what was the
1568.91,1570.23, i 
1570.65,1580.25, earle there is a new economic but nobody has seen it you do not eating and you can take estimate that eating based on the local average and what are the bases of the
1580.31,1583.55, raissa analogy of the
1584.99,1586.67, yes 
1602.93,1605.6, okay 
1606.26,1617.96, soissons and yet against
1626.81,1643.31, i think it's very fair criticism this social signals are subjected to manipulation it subjective fraud it is subject to a lot of noise and an also the conviction where people get so inured to pollution this tub during about
1644.45,1647.12, visitors and 
1649.07,1653.06, histories are estate
1653.27,1656.78, yes yes
1663.74,1672.32, he currently no but tis a very valaitis and maybe the arisaig that
1675.05,1678.62, one of the men was the
1679.04,1683.84, he 
1684.83,1686.87, since the moral
1688.85,1695.66, the eternal
1696.11,1703.25, cloyes eisenstadt in classes
1704.03,1713.21, amaranthe class hostilities salaeratus water so
1713.21,1721.22, i delessert
1721.76,1723.17, on
1724.07,1728.33, riches osiander this action
1731.24,1736.58, he soon
1736.61,1749.0, the polarisation that very good observation and i completely agree and i don't think we have a good understanding of what the noise made in social ease
1749.15,1755.42, no and also it is a highly subject to adversarial manipulation
1755.51,1759.05, and also he could be interested parties
1759.05,1768.08, but in arbitraments we found that having this information from social mediante resting and useful
1768.26,1771.08, whether it will always be useful and not sure
1789.74,1791.93, yes
1792.5,1795.95, he 
1796.07,1797.27, it is
1797.6,1800.75, its
1801.8,1804.77, i agree
1805.25,1807.86, you say sir
1807.92,1813.23, resumes
1814.73,1818.57, a
1823.1,1830.48, otaheitan apologised aleister
1832.28,1836.51, before me in the action
1836.54,1837.74, yet
1837.8,1848.36, it's a great question we just got around by bring our experiment and thence arenaria where there is a lot of human beings who are treating
1848.45,1861.35, but you are right it does not extend to somewhere and more sparsely public an area where the number of trees if you want to gather enough number of greeks the phenomena state of the phenomenon has changed in while
1868.88,1872.54, tis
1874.67,1876.92, yes
1884.57,1888.08, that is pendragons
1889.16,1890.84, the 
1892.67,1895.52, yes
1907.55,1911.99, now
1919.4,1921.38, the
1923.09,1935.36, i agree with you and in a way the social relations what is that the impact of the centuries and the influence and interpenetration also of a widening
1936.44,1945.47, i mean so so we did to experiments on forcing the bores and the other one for the orient
1945.83,1953.93, assinabaians this was really bad several
1954.11,1957.53, what we did this there were seven stations in singapore
1957.68,1964.34, we do not use the readings of position but we used the dealings of the stations and entered on that region
1966.11,1973.04, i retired to do a correlation of 
1973.46,1986.3, physical and social sense correlation with a to understand the legend factors so so first we took all the persevering and then created the matrix and then found out the latimers
1986.39,1999.08, the fact disinherited then we did for only the testation without brains and with trees and in the partition and then we compared the letter factors
1999.08,2008.26, the next aguacatlan rector for any to station if you do comparison there the muscular could be used at trees
2008.32,2010.3, in a way
2010.42,2015.85, use of titania actually help get a better
2015.88,2018.31, on the lotus
2019.3,2021.13, the first 
2021.13,2028.42, on one was beastily removed some other stations so we could not use
2028.42,2036.49, some of the stations but we had the full activation of arable and then with yet estimate the readings in the other places
2036.82,2039.7, again what we found was
2040.75,2052.42, the intemperate benediction when at the full data arise had the passionate and then again when we did the attention without
2052.54,2065.92, with the tread again you can see the big greenness can get up better approximation of the missing manuscripts when venus social
2068.86,2074.62, these are the busiest potentates
2076.75,2088.3, then this is for a new york city we looked at the the events that believe march sent barrister and columbus for
2088.3,2096.28, and to this because we do directement a going on at the option abroad so we came around the problem of what you allude to
2096.49,2102.25, again he looked at adrienne was the politest
2102.25,2116.08, the negative is when there was nobody and then i become parsing just the aeriform ion and the cameraria information and again be found that using the social information actually has
2116.17,2117.64, scuse
2117.64,2122.41, in these limited experiments
2127.33,2131.65, this particular case that is again
2133.36,2137.95, probably disease probably he makes of the concept is probably
2142.93,2147.13, was not i mean the orderly had captured and then evacuate
2147.31,2150.01, i could consider all bedaubed noted
2153.28,2157.72, we've been collecting the data we have been collecting to do for last eyes
2159.7,2168.91, so then we didn't even classification and again our position colonelhousing the physical and social alas
2171.82,2174.22, he is the
2174.37,2192.4, in many cases relations to exist in possibilities that reflect the common evening observed reputed the thing and in many places social sinners even for the physical sense meetings and i maybe it is even useful in the outlier cases
2192.67,2205.63, all this made causation is a good technique for using these sources of information it helps to the pope and in fact it directed it also helps by winter
2208.75,2215.89, we reason waterloo into a exploiter the features than just using and coming martini
2216.04,2220.87, to look at some other affectation methods for doing 
2220.96,2227.83, and what are the interesting is evolution of the situation not the world even
2227.86,2229.36, allusion
2229.78,2231.61, he went evolution
2231.76,2239.62, also we want to see whether for sentiment analysis of particular region you know can be caused similar technic
2239.74,2240.7, we want to
2241.66,2244.75, and that's the end of my dark
2244.9,2245.92, just
2246.55,2248.86, this that we hoping that
2249.13,2255.16, if this was well then we can have reading centers and leading humans and actual information thegither hopefully
2255.19,2256.45, forward
2257.17,2266.86, soon
