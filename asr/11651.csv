54.48,59.22, they've made the highest resolution images yet of this phenomenon
59.31,103.05, a particle physics experiment on the international space station has found evidence for what may be dark matter that matter has never been observed but is thought to make up a round twenty per cent of the universe the alpha magnetic spectrometer detects cosmic particles released by stars and galaxies within and beyond the milky way by studying these particles sides at detected anti matter positrons which are thought to originate from dark matter researches of caution but further analysis is required to confirm whether this is indeed evidence for dormante but the results are still an exciting development in our understanding of the universe

146.16,177.66, it appears that the underside of sais melts to create a cool layer of fresh water this insulates the ice from warmer ocean waters below and thus prevents further melting this negative feedback effect is expected to continue into the future it's important to know however that this melting patent doesn't apply to land eyes which has a greater impact on sea level rises and finally japanese neurosis plain they can read your dreams
177.78,203.37, when a white people were showing a series of images while scientists monitored their brain activity the same patterns of activity were then also observed while a people were asleep when as what they had dreamed about the subject said they had seen the same image that they were shown while awake recognizing these brain activity patterns and interpreting them is the first step to developing a scientific dream reader
203.46,279.15, the window when he had a moment why not have a look at the signs logs on the arries website my latest regular blow comes the discovery preparation in interpretation of a one hundred million year old bone of the loggers discuss florence nightingales vitalistic the future of bendable pones and the advisability or otherwise of resurrecting extinct species there's lots more there your shortened something appealing just follow the linguet that's been another very big weakenin for more on these and other signs new stories have a look at the arisest aristagoras where you can also sign up for notifications of future episodes you can follow the conversation on twitter using the hashed weaken sigh i'm poilus on behalf of the arisen an see an ex wakarighwakayonne
