24.78,30.03, going to take us mediates my name's still get an joined by a magnet
30.12,117.48, cannon and the cameras were looking at today are the except series and also the exit so paul which which side of the table do we want to start on here ah well i guess we can do them in chronological order so to speak how they were first released which will be starting with the way i like to refer to them as papaimiento is the flagship of the series the three important letters have the three hundred series which is the larger one and the tree is different from the other model in that series which is the except three hundred and only one way and that is that the three five hassenreuter
117.54,156.87, sort of situation where you need have uniform latency you can do that using the gunlock and then the time code can then be shared kind of like what we're doing here you can either do it as a hardware share ticket for a feed some place tendinous place or what we've got here we've got actually except three five in the next one of the little one to in a couple of minutes we have the two of them said to free run time one they've been dancing using those means concertmeister theaters are going to be the same with the one of five
157.14,170.67, has the hierophantic that's absolutely correct it's a little bit different on the generalitie code because instead of having individual pickets for that this is going to have one that with
171.09,182.91, so yes the except has no science time co connectors and the one does what they are in every other way completely the same 
183.03,199.44, distinction between the two of them they record to the same media which is a compact flash cards so it's really available you know moderately priced and in terms of the tameless flash based media that we do have on this level of camera
200.28,203.64, the series however only has
203.7,237.63, one sense and the three hundred series has three censors in our traditional three chips set up and they are one third intention each camera and they are seen as censors on bates and that's all telautomatics on each the same sense in this camera as in this charegite one has three okay and it's a new tell me about the censor so i had heard a term thrown around at the pile sixty one per cent larger because the censors to point
238.53,289.38, seven point seven negative stonehaven sort exactly nineteen twenty by ten eighty which allows the pigs to be larger which is of course increased flow light performance absolutely vision number of things to increase the low light performance on this about without going into too much detail the long an the short of it is that you know we've had a lot to do it can with developing senor the years this is the first time we've put a specifically viamede style camera starting with the overwrought the entire industry is it's always becoming more and more sensitive to low light were to starting to really begin describes the surface i think of this sensitivity that we can get out of the assignees
289.38,292.17, exceptional in terms of one third in censor
292.38,296.34, in low lights it's not going to compare to what you know
296.37,308.55, what has now become the standard for low light performances now the you know larsan large sense of cameras just it's not going to do that is light or sponge a bigger sponges going to get more light but for one third censor it is fantastically sensitive
308.85,339.84, one thing that we have talked about before throughout all these cameras then even going on down to the exit the caesars that same chip esaias the except one hundred and it's my understanding that some of the smaller cannon cameras were configured for doing both cinema and still but when they came to the extent new chip what cannon had kind of decided was okay you've got your still camera in the bag and this is going to be optimist for
339.87,347.46, video so yes you can shoot stills on this camera but it's more obtained for
347.76,370.35, then anything in that form factor that's come before you referred to pretty much the cataline that we have with the foreseeable your firing to the ship while the chimes definitely got a lot of design features that are specific to video the cameras are specific to video certainly you can take nice still images out of any of these cameras but i mean the nineteen twenty my ten eighty still
370.38,378.36, really i mean whether you've got a power shot or you've got to esther's just so many other ways that really take better still so 
378.69,386.49, take still i don't think they were ever designing any of these cameras with anything other than being do specific or ideal for video
386.55,388.11, an excellent time
388.2,400.59, i think one of the most important distinctions though when you get into talking about the x versus any of the accessories the extent is our first professional abdera
402.3,433.14, like you said the same censor but recording in abates it very different than the two of these because these record in our excitement person fortune to color space and pagiantes is abits the same as directed
433.2,457.02, twice as much color as a fortune going to get it maybe so that callisthenes that color is going to help you so of course with the price increased the commerce is basically going to give you say more more latitude in terms of color correction to disturb
457.38,462.63, giving the would be more forgiving you have more information to deal with in the first place
463.56,470.7, you know is twice as much color as fortune so right there when you start to get any kind of celebrating information
470.94,490.41, you the more information you have in the first place the more information that you can deal with it obviously going to be much better for green screen and composing and also there's only one version of the exeter is no sidenote all had mind yes and censor that kind of an environment but it's never going to be a
490.53,500.31, as sturdy as robust as what you're going to get out of saadian action but even if you're going to do it in post the fortune should collect enhances that so much
500.31,539.91, excellent and then on there's a couple of features on cameras that we've been seeing in the professional line that kind of come from a consumer world but professionals have kind of embraced him and move forward with it and that's of course going to be imitation and face protection faced the tetons a very interesting run at actually unreasonable you can do that also you can actually have these cameras track a specific face so you can put on the face detection which does sound like it's not a terribly you know professionally applied feature however if you look at the entrance to the s that was done this year
541.08,586.83, there are a lot of scenes going on where they are pretty much to dallying backwards and had people jumping in and out and they were holding focus on people's faces that was all done by using the face attention actually the deepest he couldn't have done it without having that feature one interesting things and this is a little creepy it can actually follow a specific face so you can tell it which face you want it to hold on to and that face leaves the frame it in just jumped to the other faces is capable of detecting about thirty five faces all at once anyway but when that person comes back who is the one that would be highlighted in white it will know that that's the same pace and the others are high lighted kind of in and yellow so when it's integrally but yes okay and as interesting when you say that going into professional situation that a deep would say
586.98,600.6, only thing that here she wants to use that's quickly it was more that it was just a tool that they had never considered using and they went wiolent have done that if i didn't have it it wouldn't come out the same you know i mean certainly any skilled can rack
600.81,606.6, but of the electronics are a little bit faster and i knows un just looking for faces and it'll stop right on
606.75,612.09, a lot of lights and took fairly high out stop and therefore you can have more if the field
612.09,636.75, excellent excellent so in terms of price points on all these cameras it's kind of move around over time but basically were looking at roundhouse extend and then the except one hundred is about three thousand the except one o five jumps up to about four thousand and then the price points on the except three hundred and three or five here hairoun sixty five hundred and seventy five hundred so
636.99,642.06, one other thing on the excess but improved for use by
642.18,644.82, british broadcasting
644.82,649.08, corporation yeah becapped it they gave the
649.11,672.15, not horrent familiar with exactly all their terminology things but they have sort of a general approval yes that's good enough we can we can use that and it was very quick to be approved just for that but it has been actually approved across the board for being seen you know a lot of stations will do this you know discriminates evaluate any kind of camera and say that
672.15,734.25, so they might have one or two or three tears of qualification levels and so for certain programming that might be you know upon this has been approved across the board for the bbc excellent excellent so it's not only fifteen percent of the contact can be done on this thinbaing excellent among to know so of course a cannon is also well known for their for their five days and seventies or the digital largamente reception worldwide for professional filming applications these tools are going to be a little bit different so with with the digitalis of course crew focus polarities lends choices so when people say that they're looking for something that is that flexible is fast determining gun comes up readiness are coming pretty close to almost being a perfect camera for for that those running on application to tulare
734.46,750.0, because the ability to do low light for events where you're not doing narrative based off you're not sure with dale's tracking shot everything so you need to get a shot quick and i think the strength of these cameras one is going to be on the three o five with three
750.03,782.85, dependent rings for iris focus an aperture and then on the on the one hundred and one of five that turns into basically a switch rang that switches in between somfin iris which is excellent and then on the one on the ten on the exeter is dialogues well for adjusting but on these cameras you have a lot of physical real estate for manipulating setting so everything is not buried in a menu so if a contestation where your training perhaps a second shooter or a new shooter
782.97,796.77, on automatons so we can to if you look at one of actually it's even got this lock so you can set everything as you want and then lock it and then if you have an inexperienced camera handle
796.89,860.49, the ability to go out and shot within the can't mess up any certain pieces of it as far as the running gun yeah there's a lot of running on capability have all these automatic features that you can do on this however if you take a for example the series we have these three rings the fourneau manual where were you have it in full manual we actually the ring will stop so aristophanes only when it's in that particular setting but then you also have a window with distance markers renelle can set a completely hundred percent focus and if you have to do it in that kind of semantically measure and mark sort of environment you can do that organically which were talking about about the buttons yet you've got access to absolutely everything out here of course there are a lot of fearthought me if you want to accessorial the buttons on the outside of the snare all assignable they all extension there is obviously one that common they already have a certain function but those are even reasonable
860.61,865.89, and also has built in a defile which is very nice there's three of them the glass
865.92,867.96, at one
867.96,877.05, just on the term of on the topic of economics rather we have this very very nice really high resolution absolutely gorgeous
877.29,949.08, the screen which i can push forward a little bit more you can let the thirty five degrees there turns blows for you as a mere function has a erection of limiter or if you need a show it's somebody who's on the other side that way but because of the distance that it is and this was designed on purpose and you leuillet of taper backer a lot of people don't realize that they're a little bit more of a comfortable as a shoulder shooter you've got a shoulder mutability gratuitously and that some parting else you want to say or what was most exciting about getting to kind of represent work with with the line of products it's really really strong line of products if you go to the top just to look at the very basic things that you have you've got three excellent semitones
949.11,961.35, my favorite actually feature from all this is the way for motoring factors that you get on the street i always use my way for manitto help me with my exposure i can set 
961.35,968.82, setting what you would get for way for one great that is small so it doesn't have the bits on the rest listed on it but it does have
970.29,991.38, markers for the specific points that you really know resolution as well yeah this monitor is fantastically high rustled i see we also have some peeking so for you have pinguicula the pekan be white blue red or yellow people like that red with an dropping the
991.41,998.91, you find the old into black and white is one of the teverone one of the trucks 
999.0,1020.48, i like to have the russet because you can get the sabines i like to have one said to a hundred than one said the seventieth where i'm clipping my highlights i know exactly what my skin tones are and then i can use the way for monitor to see if there's any kind of secular highlights are going to pop out and distort my shot that i may not be noticing when i look in the free excellence tools for
1020.6,1025.7, assisting and of your productions and on that no
1025.73,1056.93, appreciate body taking a look in watching this video at texas bedims we have access to bringing paul sensible questions so a few don't get paul on the phone or if avenues on a kind of for me i can build up my knowledge and then take some specific questions on a pal so we do have that access here texas meenisters fell has my card so fiery to contact than your temple no problem in
