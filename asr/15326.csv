0.63,7.11, here at mortlake in lovely adelaide with our years and to day i'm going to get to drive this
7.44,11.46, the electric car
14.28,55.2, no trap was built by a very talented team at the university of south australia led by this extremely tatman pitapat sobieskium me what the original sort of motivation was for building is we used to do solacing as that race from daintiest we figured if we can drive from town to either we should be at it to work and back we wanted a cold we can use all the time for just driving around town here that didn't use hossifus right and that was so that it was originally a university based overmen and engineering project sintiments to develop the concept
55.2,58.32, a engineering electrical engineering students actually
58.38,86.28, i ordain design and bit the cat to you it was absolutely designed until within the university mission and so i mean tell just go through a few of the things cause the obdurate electric cars and never do oneleigh different so i mean in terms of batteries and range and all things are meaneth batteries that you lose the catilinarian when we first got the car we one of a range of about a hundred columbus so we had friestone
86.64,124.77, it had ideograms and it's now but a range of over two hundred calantha's really good anabelle's very healthy brangien has quite a lot of commercially vital electorate because i got that kind of ianthe sacred is its kilograms lot for the canoes take a lot of energy to push along the road because i incommensurate as it inside it on rogliano red messighit
124.83,156.03, try the design because it's i think fairly unusual not what people are used to wear and the passengers the passengers sitting behind the driver walkelin why those decisions were made that there were two reasons for that really the first as we knew that it had to be light way had to be ardentis having the driving the passing behind the driver manteca get good ariamenes if you've got to wellsley got for you've got more white and more complex than you need and
156.03,182.88, we did it like this is because we wanted something that didn't look like a normal car right so it's just as a liberator coming we don't want people to accidentally you know i care not to cross the straits does and so having one bisanthe other basically means the bit that's pushing into the wind is reduced lovely
182.97,193.17, and by the time my people driving in in australia have just one person in the car yenowine we don't often use the best but it's the action
193.2,217.83, and what about the motors what it's got one as one of its actually at the moment cotton electric scuttle resting as got the the motor the production here and the wheel all initiatory will drive rowland madam what else have you done with it so since you built it in promovent just driven it round to the campus we send very little driving around the campus were the students to build it actually took it
217.83,222.54, drive it from donations ration class in the world's alton
223.71,248.19, one that i going to find coal from some one saying is it any good for long trips and they showed me maplewood we drive it around the world before i thought about us a year we can do that so we did we we drove it from geneva detest and basically kept driving to tobacko generoso this course been round the world it has its abateth tousand comes and the i mean i'm just intreaties longer trips i've done in the k where i've got a plug in
248.19,256.98, you have to presume had to plan the journey in advance of all italian you can stop at the top was plain and he would generally drive for
257.04,259.53, come in the morning
259.71,300.27, charge up while having lunch long lance and then insinerations just this team or whether other tonthormid the retort so you had back up support and we had a little no better was one for fan for the three to friendly sufficient to fantastic and what year when when did you finish that the noisiest we finished in february to right what are the projects would have you been wainamoinen we have been doing what i found describing around the city and county working on a project with an indian simba
300.39,319.41, i contacted me in said copybook transporting patients to asperse a man they pregnant women in particular have to walk more than ten kilometers to literatures were this no way you do that sensuousness of petal carousing off the shelf but 
319.8,347.61, really don't have any energy so we're looking at designing them something that can be sold appeared and when you say talapoosa youthink a lot of people are who don't know a lot about electrics go why can't you just put saloons on the roof of the car and use that will hospites to explain he would have to be very big car they have to be an enormous hats the solar racing cars and drive from down to a latitudinarian estensi panels and possibly by ten millions of dollars on their alamans to drive
347.61,368.52, very small white with one person without an exact so for a practical vehicle you need more energy can fight so so so in africa rather would be solid panels that would charge the cars that the plant that's where we would have some soporific up batteries and with head refectories sorrow in the case
368.52,403.86, but essentially you've got a transportation system is not reliance on fuel from anywhere else because there isn't fermentative to use very little energy right so that again going to be a light weight vehicle that can transport one pregnant woman and a driver peterstrasse constructed that yet but that's what they plantain we started with that industrial designers who were working on the industrial design with a theater that drove tavern the world is working on it and 
404.22,441.0, in the year but that's really good that there's people with actual direct hands on experience of one building ticketing it going in you know there's going to be there was a breast you went through round the world but were fairly challenging yesternoon experimental car wasn't the most reliable captivating bionassay solid reliable simple and primal also telling is important that people don't send very simple to maintain it has been that at first he had a very simple to build gateway a bunch of students and secondly had to be very reliable i think the
442.14,450.3, in fixing camelot have gone if i'm allowed also
450.36,456.9, compensation back intestine 
457.08,462.0, oh it anarchiste secured door
462.27,467.61, she shut the lid indiana
473.88,579.0, is it interesting engines i love the apparently volition omething up the train about it and as it all reverendissime orientation metoosin the back arteriosclerosis
579.54,583.47, fantastic anthill
583.53,585.81, that contrariant
585.84,589.17, brilliana it does it is quite noisy
589.29,593.13, but the faster go the less noisy as the initial
593.19,596.04, but it's a cool noise i like it
596.13,598.02, going to a mixture of
598.02,600.3, strain and stockade
600.51,605.73, a really good mixture of sand and the indicators
605.97,608.61, it wrong i still got in to catch
609.39,633.36, but it's really go now love it is an avery let drive at you get used to it that the kind of space of where you are you can't took might tell how wide is and you think it's wider than it really is but that is very narrowly and i was very cool and comfortable in front what was it like as a passenger beatenest very relaxing back i knew a united mind arrive errors
633.57,689.19, i mean that was genuinely a real throw for me that was fantastic thing to drive i mean i can see you know obviously if if you have the time and the finessing as a commercial become it quite a lovely get in an out releases along both the seas we know not by much but it just flies along i mean that's the biggest surprise i somehow to likin of experimental university thereabouts concluded the hellenes a joy to drive really easy to drive when once you get used to it recommencement fat at is going around the world is testament that tetotally does work and it is a functioning and i mean also that this technology works i know that all the arguments she hear against the gontaut you can runaround the last on useless much a bigot
690.51,708.48, experience thanks too uneasy and i was forming it happen and if you want to find out more about truth and the electorate transport project in africa check out team trapdoor and if you want a bit more science with a twist check out or is dog got a you
708.72,713.85, for me robert well and as you like to say over here in australia godey
