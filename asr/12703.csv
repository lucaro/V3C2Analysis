10.53,19.11, hello my name is paramore i am a anacapri editor and use group leader based in berlin germany
19.59,24.33, this is the first of two evils and in these weapons i am going to be looking at
24.36,25.77, i resolved
25.77,29.49, in particular it editing capabilities
33.66,34.8, i 
35.49,38.22, i have downloaded a venturesome light
38.85,43.68, this also works on windows so you can get a version for windows if you want
44.25,67.11, ring up the program and we're going to look at the first window here which is a logging window this is a mutable servient so if we were if there were several people using this computer
67.47,76.05, the people at his different people could log in a different people they could set up a cone the idea being that they would not miss up each other's preferences
77.22,88.41, if you want to set up an account you would do this down here you would press the great a new use button and your sin name your password and verify and your ready to go to set up a new use
89.19,93.63, a set up myself as a user so i am just going to enter my password here
96.15,99.99, and this takes me to as a project of manager
102.42,110.37, project manager is where we manage our projects and inside the project manager we have not only projects but we also have orders
111.09,114.24, and we put the projects inside odors
116.79,118.71, working from the trite
118.74,123.69, we've got a house here the house goes to the root which basically takes us to
123.75,127.5, the top of the pile of pots and projects
127.56,129.93, the moment i am at the very top of the pile
130.59,132.36, inside the project manager
133.14,151.02, i have the possibility to switch from the time to the last few there are these two items here and i can search for a specific project or folder by entering information here so i could such for edstrom scratch or round trips or whatever i want to search for her
151.41,155.94, in the last few is pretty apparent what is a poor and what is a project
156.12,163.23, that's obviously a for here as these here and if i go in here i have my projects
164.43,166.44, go to the time now view
166.65,169.17, i pressed a home but on again
169.23,181.11, the clue here is a man the time and if i have it looks like a pile of photographs thrown and to utter that means i'm actually looking here at a ford that's the cue
181.17,191.49, i go in here into this porter then a project i had to have one pradeline that have made that andiatarocte and not at fortieth border of the fatal here the tone
193.77,196.11, at the bottom left hand corner
196.32,201.57, this is where i deal with the user situation and adding projects and potent
201.84,204.27, see that i'm not in as myself
204.45,212.61, if i wanted to switch you there i went to this year i would press on this little like planet sister symbol and i could
212.64,220.53, witches here i don't either and then a close and disusing this only on so unquiet being myself
221.46,230.61, i have a cluster to any project and i have another platoon here on top of the fore which adds a new order
230.61,240.51, in this case i got a now add a create a new project so i in my project manager in my hat is from scratch forwarder an aguacate 
241.56,245.07, and then a carteret had it from scratch
256.11,260.88, i haven't a preview here of the setting for this project
261.06,266.94, to do a double click and open up my fresh project
267.3,285.3, the first thing i want to point out here is the little house down in the bottom left on corner and if we look here closely we see
285.84,287.46, manager
287.46,312.84, basically what we just looked at so the first point here is once we inside was all and if we discover were in the wrong project it's not a big deal we don't have to shut the whole thing down we go to this house button and we get back to our project manager and we get into another project so i ween always we can change our mind at any point and again inside the project manners have a house to get back to the top of the pile
313.8,316.17, i have to touch briefly on
316.44,319.95, references a very unpleasant topic
320.01,326.07, references are very complex for the simple reason that the program is very complex
326.1,330.18, and we do not find all of the preferences in the same place
331.2,338.28, sing this how i just dealt with the house let's just move on there to the right hand side and look at the project setting first a tall
338.43,339.99, but here
340.17,343.59, and like a cork basically
343.65,353.61, you need to check the manuel you need to read the manual an you need to know what you're doing here one that the mistake if you have your
353.67,358.5, frame red set up you could really get into trouble so
358.53,367.89, make sure that you know what you're doing everything set up so it makes sense and if you make a change remember to press apply it here with the amplitude
370.08,382.17, one thing i will point out is the auto section make sure that you orter say it switched on are you want to back up your projects you want to crack this up and have as many backups as possible
382.89,389.25, to a maximum of backups and then you can set the time interval how of you want it to happen
390.78,393.0, again reply
393.75,397.17, and then cancel to close the window
397.8,414.69, that was the project settings we've got to it from the little colander but we can also get to it here under the fire section project sets and there by the way of the project manager again we saw the project managed here we want to look very briefly at the preferences
414.9,432.84, and preferences is the section where we deal with stuff like language the language that were using on system the media stories especially means any fires are rendering a captain they will go to this place we want a big fast external drive
433.23,442.11, we have into faces i have a fork altitude but i don't have a connected the moment if it was connected it would be showing a here the list
442.89,449.04, to panels for coloration and advanced me not even at a goal
449.16,454.74, you make changes remembered the press save down here bottom right her corner i'm going to press
454.77,456.27, in this case
458.73,462.33, just really flying over the preference 
463.05,473.55, let's just before you now actually get started look at one more thing and we need to be aware of the fact that the program is divided up into four sections
473.67,478.62, we have a media section we have an edition coloration and deliver section
478.65,484.26, and surprise surprise media sections where we manage a media eddies where we edited
484.38,493.14, where we collocated we're not going to really look at the color correction individual is because there are plenty of other people doing amazing to torres about this kind of stuff
493.59,499.95, basically jump over that completely and then we're going to get to deliver section the fairy and
500.76,524.37, i am in the mediate hap of resolve the mediator is divided into two sections to main sexes we have a sex calibre animation called that media for
524.52,539.73, the library gives us access to all of the drive connected to a system so i can go to articulate and borrow down into a folder and look for specific material
541.5,555.9, message here telling me that my not to bite is not connected at the moment i'm getting this case i have a device connected sometimes sometimes i don't have a connected if you don't have a doyenne ted you're not going to see this
556.74,565.62, i have different ways of viewing the material we see this recurring throughout the program i have the tombolani have the last few and i can search for stuff here
565.68,567.27, each window
568.89,595.2, if you don't see this it is as a matter outwind here in the bottom right hand corner if you don't see it don't worry you can get to it by pressing this little is likely a lay well i can and then you see the same the madelaine the matador window basically gives you some technical information about the clips in question the lips at you are looking to review and potently import into your project
595.56,598.32, i had a
598.32,622.35, three different types of material and quite frankly it was a mess this material came this year came from a black berry i had some weird frame rates i had some practice of going on resolve was able to import all the stuff resolve with basically throat pretty much anything useful at it you might run into proposes
622.35,633.75, playing about the stuff my computer was not copying back record which doesn't really surprise me regardless of the program in question
633.99,642.12, so i went to the trouble of calling my lips in advance i made them all into a progress
643.05,658.44, that curtis just made it simple for me to work with the material it just a maker made for me at least a more smooth experience and he gave me a level plain field with all of my material being the same for me
659.52,667.08, i can get more information but my lip here if i press on music i can and i can
667.08,675.6, an audio creatures here on the right hand side
676.41,700.74, if i just want to just illustrate a point or i can go to review and find her and i see exactly the same path that i am seeing here inside resolve inside resolve i see among my four terrified in my own line follerer on the fine eleven of a man i see the four terrier a drive and at the foot for on the clip in question
703.71,733.56, got rid of these windows here at the moment i don't really need them on my homework i know i know everything is okay i can prove my kid here in the kind of like a viewer i have here also some very fascination by nampont which basically means i know how long the clip is i haven't scrubbed down here i am cried with a lip i pressed the play but i can take a ride all the usual stop that hole expect him not leader
733.77,745.62, so at this point i really i want to start to move down here to the media pool and what i want to do it i want to get the clips from the library from the paradise into
746.13,751.71, the results actually have the lips in resolve and able to work with them at it with the
751.95,755.34, waiting them here in the edifice
756.18,789.99, i've given ways of getting the clips into the metabolic just do it click inkwell and up the first click clip will end up here in the median i have this time a list option here the search option we see this one over the place in cyprus i can also sent to dry clipped into the medical indeed drag it here in in the mediation the left hand side into the ford in this case it is a masterful is always a masterful he automatically
790.35,792.06, i can
792.18,798.21, let several clips i can also do a right masklike and i can
798.39,805.59, this option head into media or san kind of thing for ways of getting to the same result
805.62,815.55, and he in the bottom left hand corner i have it a plassans i could make a fort in this case for example accordeth
817.2,823.17, and i go back to the master order i could for example take my two
823.68,825.18, my two
825.18,830.4, is here and i can trace them into my graphic for here
832.35,847.08, it's just a basically a way of organizing and sorting my lips once i've actually imported into resolve in organized and sought from here in order ready for the added which will be looking at in that next
847.08,870.6, this looks familiar to think of the media for this is where we have all of the media that we went to the trouble of in jesting in the first section in the mediator in the editor
870.66,877.83, we've got some other stuff and here we've got here on the left ansdore have the folders we had made the graphic faraway of a master for
877.86,886.29, you don't see these photos on the left hand side you probably not seen the moccasin lick on this little but that her buttonholes you to follow her structure
886.68,893.67, we have the usual kind of stuff here of ways of viewing things toneless few
894.15,901.35, just like those there and of course we have time right as of now we've got no time in over going to change a very very shortly
901.5,910.35, here on the left hand side we have its called two up editor basically means we've got two screens where we can look at material as of now we have nothing
910.41,920.52, that's going to change but i shortly here on the left hand side where we look at the material we want to edit into our time line on the right hand side is where we look at the material in our time
921.15,933.18, our time nine here as of now is absolutely empty we don't even see any tracks on the left hand side we don't actually really have a time like technically we just have a box where we put the time light into
934.59,948.75, thus pretty much at disposed i could mention that these two windows have a lot in common the one on the left and on the right the view for a material and the view of for a time line a usual kind of stuff we've got
948.99,957.39, we've got time could be cut duration we've got clay take all all this kind of stuff pretty pretty standard to peter
959.49,968.76, into the broader so we've got the media pool we've seen that we've got the time lines window here as it now we don't have time in so let's change that
969.09,974.01, i do a mouse a light of right masklike and i say create new time line
974.31,978.72, and we give it a name
983.16,994.23, we have created a new time and we see that here on the left hand side if we've been paying attention we see up here also we have our editor and the right hand side of the
994.29,995.91, time in view
996.03,1001.52, on the left and so we see we've got some tracks we have a video track and we have an audio track
1001.7,1020.72, let's switch to the media poor and we have our lips inside here in the media poor and let's just select the first clip and this case is going to be
1020.75,1027.23, review of the fellow this is the fellow that we're going to be looking at and this would be our review of the philip
1027.29,1028.52, so
1029.06,1034.46, usual kind of thing you could double click to get that into the view of the different ways that getting in in there
1034.67,1038.24, you could double click you could drag it in there
1040.01,1042.14, actually just press
1042.17,1044.51, which also makes a lot of sense
1045.08,1049.46, or it agropoli in the
1049.52,1057.59, and now we want to have a look at it so we're going to just do some very basic navigation here in the viewer let's just start at the beginning
1057.65,1063.65, let's press the home button on the numeric keyboard assuming you have an american connected to your computer
1064.07,1071.03, have a home but if you don't have a numerous other ways of doing it with unction buttons an a and adopt
1072.56,1077.39, so home but i pressed the home bonavita me to the very beginning of the clip
1077.99,1080.03, i see here the symbols
1080.12,1087.53, the rectangle boxes these are telling me that i am at beginning of the clip on the neath the home butter is also a and button
1087.62,1094.64, i pressed the unborn and i see these three boxes here in the right hand side that as mediated of the cliff
1094.91,1099.62, i can go back to the home back to beginning again and actually have an in and out here
1099.98,1101.81, just the internet
1103.34,1105.32, but ted beginning home
1106.4,1113.54, this is the little player thing it's in the burning the tomore through my clip
1113.57,1117.65, then i was to have the usual stuff like a compressed jake
1119.03,1129.47, all is to present one as a present one sits plays an enormous speed twisting four times at times
1129.95,1133.76, and then kate and of course i can go back with the same thing
1140.42,1151.4, having then a green light showing up here as a good sign that means i made to play my material as in rear time if it is red i'm running into trouble and i am dropping frames
1151.73,1154.58, running several programs here at the same time
1154.61,1158.87, so i'm actually i'm taking my computer a little bit to the edge but
1158.9,1162.08, seems to be all working pretty at the moment
1163.88,1170.39, so that's just a very very basic navigation we let's go to the beginning of this clip
1171.23,1182.69, and i just play this and i'm going to set an in and out point and i press if i in what all for it and i just know that where i want to get to his pretty much at beginning of this cliff
1184.31,1193.16, the one on the left a little and letting her penance which were
1193.49,1199.7, it was a chastened
1205.04,1207.5, i took my chin
1207.98,1209.78, the minister
1211.67,1220.91, sonia not happy with either my inner ammount i can correct that so for example i could press shift i to get my pinpoint
1222.29,1231.08, that takes me to the important i can check that which i never want to check my outpoint a press ship all
1231.53,1234.83, just reinette bit by pressing a
1236.87,1238.13, i
1238.13,1243.56, the antiochians and anticipation for
1243.98,1249.65, correct my apparent is peagin because i want to have my out point perfect
1249.89,1254.87, now at this point what i can do is i can drag my clip
1254.9,1257.63, insert to the inset
1259.01,1264.86, men point on the right hand side in the time line of the and i just let go of the mass
1265.49,1268.04, i have now inserted my first
1268.07,1287.51, into the time before looking at the second edit i want to just greatly have a look at something here in the bow man
1287.87,1292.85, no crown here to sortie and the letter he
1293.15,1298.01, the source view this is the time in a few at this is a two editor
1298.19,1301.01, this means is we compress the book once
1301.97,1304.88, and we change which window was active
1305.09,1319.97, it anyway after basically switching weekly if we want to play the contents of the view we rescue if we want to press the content of the time nine we rescue the hamlet short cut and it should seem pretty for meat anybody who is coming from abbot
1321.53,1335.27, moving on to the second as i select my clip from the media pool i press enter together into the sorcerer and i am going to jilt gets to the point where i want to set my impot
1342.23,1346.31, i 
1351.59,1366.32, i want to do some real some fine uncouth arrow keys so for example if i wanted to find the the very first frame of this clip i could use the oracles left and right to find the first frame
1366.71,1389.84, the theatrical okanagan here
1392.99,1396.41, stand upon all for out erin
1403.34,1408.35, actually wasn't technically park on their last frame of the
1409.25,1416.24, here in the time in view so i just made an active and i pressed the and button and i see
1416.36,1420.14, really on the last frame because i have this jacket edge
1421.97,1450.05, i'm ready to do my second insert at it and i conjure and dropped to do my second insert at italian now into do it will go go down a little bit deeper and we're going to look at active windows selection at first glance it might assimilate but appalling but is actually quite simple cause it's just command
1450.05,1452.69, then one two three four five
1453.14,1457.07, just the maybe the way to remember is it's kind of like a clock
1457.1,1465.44, basically works in a clockwise direction starting with the source fewer so man one
1465.8,1476.63, going clockwise obviously on the clock naaman one is the select or activates the viewer command to activate the timeline
1476.78,1483.59, three activates the time line command for the browse and command five
1483.59,1487.58, as the media for so this is a very very
1487.61,1494.78, ficient effective way of navigating the interface here in the editor after venturesome
1495.98,1498.53, let us make sure that our
1498.98,1510.68, i putative command five once active i can start using the arrow keys up and down left and right to start navigating the clips inside the media pool
1510.92,1520.79, once my appropriate clip is active and i see its active i see orange boxer what is active i compress enter to get it into my
1521.6,1522.77, source 
1523.49,1547.76, briefly i just just touched on the time called windows here left hand side is the duration of the clip right hand side as we impart in the clip the same also goes for the time and biheron the left and side is exactly the same thing that is the duration of my clip of my time line in an effect and that is where a part in my time
1548.66,1552.8, as soon as i start setting in and out point straton for change
1552.92,1560.75, and the duration of will basically be the time that elapses between my inn and midpoint
1561.08,1568.4, at this point i want to edit his clip into the time line and i happened to know the exact time called were stars
1570.17,1576.65, i could of course flick here and start entry time i don't even need to do that the main thing is that this
1576.8,1581.66, in the sources actor and then i used my new american
1581.69,1586.04, punch in the appropriate time care so i happen to know that my in point
1588.47,1594.17, you sidestepped there automatically i see the time care has changed
1594.38,1595.52, appropriately
1595.52,1598.4, and now i pass i for in
1599.15,1601.94, i happen to know what my outfit is
1607.13,1611.24, again i see that my time called changes appropriately
1611.54,1613.97, he pressed for
1614.36,1633.65, basically means have set my ear and my outpoint just by entering time court an amrei to get this clip into my time and i'm going to drag this and uganda this now for the last time because from here on in will goodsoe more shortcuts and become more efficient in a drag and i do and insert at it into the time
