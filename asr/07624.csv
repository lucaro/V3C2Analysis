581.34,609.18, so the morning radio show that we do and you enjoy doing it i do a cabalist for and wait about a hundred and seventy pounds a like john wayne i think followed i'm a disappointment to our people yet
609.24,618.78, a madrepore in the navy to the fellow what i call your your broad world you
618.81,637.41, the educational system at the naval academy they present you with a broad education and then expose you to a world element we had classmates that were of course from other countries about seven percent of them we had exchanged program with foreign students
637.41,683.16, of course we exchanged ideas and actually had exchange programs with the other service academies i think probably the fact that we also had very good lectures who had come in we had one of the prince princess from saudi arabia come in and make a presentation that way before there was an oil operators we had leapt figures the president are present united states would come of course and under that kind of influence in your perspective changes from one nation
683.58,687.27, the public figure or private figure
687.33,724.77, what individual has had the biggest influence on your life patmos important public influence that i had was was like eisenhower hourly yes he was the most he can he happened to be at the what they called the light weighted her fifty five pound army navy game is played before the big army neapel toland spoke briefly to the brigade of midshipmen and he influenced me a great deal i respected him not only as a soldier but as a statesman and as a very very fine politician
725.34,728.73, i've told people before that
729.18,733.05, one person i would vote for if they ever ran from political office
733.05,735.72, part they represented
735.75,783.45, marveling for political office he said like a leaking ship magnanimities i'm flattered that you say that but i take the constituency that we represent would be all that i would say that i am flattered but i don't see that there's that much a potential i think that a person in texas needs to be a native texan and a person running from east texas polly has to be born in east texas to really grasp the number of both that he would have to have i don't think a person for while i can come etesian represent east texas as well as what the constituent constituents say would expect
783.48,801.81, years you know if you're not teetotalers for you're not a monetary citizen but now you never will be well i consider it a great honor to be here and i am privileged to be here but i just think that basically they're going to look for native my native born population to represent them to much 
801.99,806.91, some time ago i asked you this on the morning show and i guess it's a proposal
807.15,811.71, you had been sworn in to day as president of the united states
811.98,877.23, what is the first thing you would do i seriously found that we pick up a check i would do this exactly what clinton did a day and that would be to reach over and squeezed my wife and give her a kiss and then stay to loreto her for four years hereinbefore was a creation in the wall street geradas at the first have your days what would be the worst thing that can happen to clinton and that would be that he be interviewed on sandflies
877.29,892.8, come a greater respect for each other that they are a very family oriented both of them go to church every sunday it's been it's been a good while since we've had in the white house a family who does
893.31,908.55, go to church on a regular basis but president's reagan and president bush were not known to be active participants in church life with all of the qualities that we seem to want
908.61,938.55, who survived marriage crises and all it sort of thing and yet there's a suspicion you know he would mind now it's his generation that skipping our generation a little bit that have brought the modern aspect that divorces popular and i think that he asked to keep the body or the image beastily value in the white house and so i guess what i'm saying is i hope he maintains that value for the full four years or eight years of fedia does a good job
938.67,962.46, all i dare we aroused up one of our segments and when we come back i want to talk about the economy as it now stands what effect the new administration is going to have on the economy and just sort of project over the next year what you see happening economically in the country because
962.49,987.96, crossroads through the economies the guinevere's going to get worse there's some good signs which is also some bad signs out there and we'll talk about that when we return with my gesture if you have a question of jerry candlesticks

1019.64,1031.19, but hiring office workers is to let frontera handle it they can play people on a temporary basis or full time and if some one doesn't fit in there's no firing or retiring
1031.19,1048.41, a temporary for replacement and paying a weekly bill is a lot easier than handling all those paraqueets feronia temporaries does that for you and all other people are presented so that save time and money i think calling for domitius and

1098.72,1101.81, matter which your relations are cremate
1104.18,1107.21, opportunity for us to rejoice and be thankful
1107.39,1110.51, from the mediocrity coalition
1111.77,1122.3, but were this in the ages tarentum east texas securities and lafargue on mooning radio show how much
1122.48,1126.23, or impact will a new president have
1126.62,1128.21, economy
1128.54,1131.03, will it be before we begin to see
1131.21,1178.46, rose a opportunity here for the president to probably get organized the first hundred days kind of the honeymoon satisfiest altenstein to see just a little bit in the commentary from the media a little bit sharper criticism but as we get past that first hundred days and we see them there's a relationship building between congress and congress is pillipot present program i think that's going to create a level of optimism or carrying through the first year and i really think at this stage that even though they erlangen out of the study gate on some of their appointees that the result will be good for the country for nineteen ninety three now for the four epeios the different story and even though the economy could be recovery
1178.49,1220.64, we start to see higher taxes are increased taxes in pretty good chops no reduction of the deficit indications that were creating more of a long term problem for children or grandchildren i think that there'll be a generation and that by educating the second and third year to start building a completely different story that we establish a base for republicans probably on the right wing to come back in and run a brigston race in ninety six he the biggest problem that the republican party has ratiocination that their trying to be with you got sort of a quest for power on the
1220.64,1248.18, on the right some of the extreme right you have influences like rush lamayure influences like pat robertson people of this ilk in the middle you have the blackboard
1248.3,1262.88, talk about the tax cut no one of the important things about clinton's campaign was the promise of a middle class tax cut now they are rethinking this
1263.09,1267.47, what a tax cut at this point is it potentially dangerous
1267.56,1304.49, for the economy and if it is is it wise for a present to say hey we may not undo that the great bulk of the revenue that comes in for operating our government and supposedly reducing the deficit comes from the tax bracket between fifteen per cent and thirty one per cent or thirty thirty five per cent depending on whether you've got the surtax on the upper it really isn't the upper bracket homopathic that pays the heaviest
1304.52,1312.17, and congested by saying it's absolutely necessary to reduce the deficit and the court debt
1312.71,1323.6, that i think that he'll get a constituency though supporting her short profile but he asked her prove over the first year at least they making a reduction in that massive deficit
1323.66,1338.78, he doesn't do that then he's got problems you know was to and rosaries been i guess what of your heroes he was a hero why is it that a guy like to row
1339.14,1356.93, say i'm going to raise taxes i'm going to put a big gasoline tax and i'm going to raise taxes and i'm going to do all this and you people are really going to have to typecase i'm going to make it rough on you i can he say that and people
1356.99,1367.1, when there you people can do that i take is a billionaire you say say i got to take and pay my chair if we're going to increase taxes or reduce the deficit
1367.13,1383.3, the work down he's not saying we're starting in the middle of working up he's saying we're starting at the top working down i think the general public at least nineteen to twenty per cent of the general public were in agreement that that would that system would work when he stopped to think about his basic
1383.39,1392.93, he is a pretty solid ground he bore in eliminating the danforth beltway banded in the lobbies
1393.02,1402.02, he it was heroic of it but interest is against any form of that nineteenth and government
1402.11,1417.5, i've never heard him say limited there but i really feel like you'd probably come out for limited terms and he is tormentor reduction of the debt balancing of the federal budget those are all good qualities and are pretty much like our state government works
1417.5,1431.6, so i think if he can in a course he has the other programs of stronger educational base and so on that we know about but i think that what he's saying is that if you have a restoration of faith and government
1431.63,1444.44, using his harder tactics that we will pay a short term belly and a long term gandered is with the optimism that clinton brought his will have a longer term pelty
1444.44,1466.79, and probably a long term gain so just a matter when you want to pay the price the major players of the clinton economic team are now in place i would assume that lord benson went to the treasury building today and looked at his new office alienation of the economic team
1467.12,1468.26, on
1468.35,1471.74, i'll say this for the
1472.31,1481.4, the cluster of people that were round clinton when they started to make the decisions they evaluated a lot of different factors and brought the power the best
1481.46,1487.52, the democratic administration passed and present and some in the future
1487.52,1498.92, brand new faces that we've not had exposure to the national scene into a team that i think has the potential to solve some of the problems now whether or not congress in their
1499.01,1500.6, in their
1500.6,1501.38, and the
1501.41,1504.92, and their ability to mess things up
1505.31,1510.65, such a problem and a lightness that he can overcome that still remains to be seen
1510.92,1582.11, stalemate a little while that i don't get you could say the market is shaky maybe it's flat it's almost as if the market is in a holding pattern ratingans the uncertainty of a market as it forecasts the short term position of the economic situation or the politics is one of waiting and the market is really saying we've got to see how congress is going to react i would predict that by your hand the markable be up by six percent probably in the thirty five hundred range on the dalalay ent will be down just primarily because of the recovery the economy and will be saying about an average of six point five or six point seven per cent on a employment that having real and housing sales will be up substantially will interest rates are low and that basically the gross domestic product in this country who besieges a row that we looking at three and a half to four per cent by the end of the fourth quarter and that the case had consumer confess continues to climb than were really on the way to a five or six year recovery and even if he messes up on the deficit
1582.11,1592.79, i think there's a good chance that will have a very successful presidency frontlet the first two or three years the i i guess the most important question
1593.48,1604.16, some one running for office paranomasie are you better off than you were four years ago now is a curious mister optimism you know i can be
1604.16,1630.92, typical media and as negative as i want to be a jury's always got an optimistic come back but you're painting a fairly good picture of what can happen over the next four years so it would be if all of this comes to pass it would be very easy in the campaign
1631.28,1633.05, under those conditions
1633.14,1638.57, there's very few politicians that can come up against an incumbent
1638.57,1640.82, the economy is halfway decent
1641.03,1659.21, if he has built a team that doesn't have an ethical flaw or a political play to point that there's too much in fighting within the party and i don't think you'll have any body with the party than the democrats are desperately looking for an eight year term if they could do anything about the deficit
1659.3,1663.98, then had the economy working for them it's almost an unbeatable situation
1664.13,1755.42, that prediction where you know the day of the inauguration the nascent question that leprous got a pomander we're seeing some things that look and headlines scary the five point five billion dollar bills for abou know and there was a time when i emanating a losing situation at so you're crazy then we hear that managing to be laying off about two thousand people scattered
1755.42,1767.03, i say i feel better already always feel barborin after i get your report always feel better i molinist about the next four years i'm just i still think you ought to run for office cut
1767.72,1825.86, in it i appreciate that it if you had been my campaign matter may be a chance that we can work out maybe dog catcher or what may marigalante radio taparelli matter of the morning gallophobia that being with us next week were going to have the director of the national aboundin they are forming a chapter here in the bachelor they've got a big bank coming up they are devoted to conservation and all sorts of good things and we think it would be an interesting program it's nice about to have jerry alighted before smoke in the bar and before that a roorootoo so it's nice to have a living breathing guest to talk to night it's going to republican i and the whole crew here we thank you for being with us and we'll sing to mooring on the radio until then bless your house dear arts
