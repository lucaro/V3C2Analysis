6.18,10.23, my parents were both raised in
10.44,44.07, the bible belt area they went to school in tennessee they were my mom i think started going to the baptist church my dad went to the church of christ and so when my mom and dad married they both started attending the church of prices very fundamental protestant denomination alienation
44.13,45.75, experience
45.84,64.77, after we had been attending this church of price for a while and the church of christ was kind of against the gifts of the spirit whether it was healing or you know speaking in tongues or whatever and so our family was actually literally publicly disfellowship this church that we had spent years and years in
64.83,68.31, because they didn't like us but because they didn't
68.31,82.92, believe that some of the things that we were embracing were valid expressions of faith so that set us on a journey to try to find our place in the in the church and we ended up at a four square church
83.13,93.18, and that's where we stayed for several years and that's where my husband and i were ultimately married but we ended up not being not feeling quite at home there either
94.59,108.6, being raised by a celebrity you can imagine is an entirely different kind of life you're in the public a lot and my sisters and i started performing with my dad by the time i was years old
108.6,112.62, we were part of that public person as well
112.68,128.13, it was kind of like the way of described it before it's kind of like being a preacher's kid and a celebrities kid all of the same time because there were the expectations of people who were from the religious part of the cultured
128.22,133.53, and we have a certain way and then there were the people who were fans of my dad and of our family
133.56,146.43, o kind of i think embrace the fact that we were kind of the you know clean cut wholesome family image but still you know there are those that judge you by appearance and by actions and
146.43,151.5, quite as embracing as the religious community might be
153.54,179.34, definitely i think first of all i'm a first born so those of us that are first born tend to be perfectionistic anyway i took it upon myself to be you know my mom's little helper the only problem is my mom had four of us in three and a half years so that made me a very little helper and you know alternately
179.34,197.7, myself by how other people thought of me or what their opinions of me were and i also drove myself to a pretty ridiculous level in school even in elementary school i would stay up hours and hours in homer that i probably could going
199.2,203.67, carried over that perfectionism carried over into
203.67,212.43, what we look like and what we did in the performance world too and so i grew up in the period of time where people like wigan share were the
212.43,238.2, o models to try to emulate and look up to and so being the perfectionists that i was i felt like thinnest tenders better and thinnest right so i started reallotment girl often does when she going
238.26,267.21, painfully because i was also being viewed by a lot of people and we had to fit into costumes and you know they always say t put extra panels on you and all that stuff and i was you know really trying hard to be what i thought would be the perfect image helpeth perfectionism is that you are consciously aware of how you are falling short of these unrealistic standards that you set for yourself so your focusing on everything that you're not doing and everything that you think you're not
267.3,274.41, then all the things that you are doing and the things that you accomplished so it's kind of a no in situation
276.6,288.33, i always took my face seriously even as a little kid and if i hadn't had that to hang on to through my ears with eating disorders and 
288.69,307.29, issues and things like that i don't know how i how my story would have turned out you know i felt like my life at the point where my eating disorders really got bad i felt like my life was kind of falling apart and in my attempt to try and take control of an area of my life i had completely lost
307.41,316.41, and it was a long time coming out of it but i remember as part of my experience in going through and exile
316.53,320.31, for a period of time i literally took communion
320.37,326.37, and the reason i did it even though i wasn't raised catholic was that i believed
326.49,337.8, by taking communion i was taking more of jesus in me i believed that wholeheartedly i believe that in the same way that eating or not eating were causing my
337.89,341.43, behavior and emotional and psychological struggles
341.76,342.9, i believe that
342.93,351.69, communion would be deeming my eating and taking more of jesus into meccan been more of him unless of me i know
353.19,375.51, my husband had lived in the middle east and had done missions work for a while and he had really been trying to find what the early roots of the church were and to try and find the earliest expression of christianity and figure out why it had branched off into so many different you know varying denominations and so he started with the jewish roots of christianity and lived in israel for a while
375.54,382.41, then the next step was to look at the catholic church and he had a friend who was a catholic
382.56,383.88, kind of a
383.97,402.84, scholar who kind of helped him answer a lot of his questions and point him in that direction but he didn't actually fall through at that point i was going through a similar journey myself at that time and our family had done at special in israel and i had felt overwhelmed by that sense of
402.96,416.34, walking through eternity in a way part of the past peasant present and future all at the same time and felt that i really wanted to learn the language and may be go back some day so i was studying hebrew
416.64,428.76, and in fact mutual friends of ours knew that dan had lived there and so they introduced us in the first words we ever said to each other were in hebrew but we ended up feel
428.97,441.93, with each other about this kind of restlessness in or the church that we were going to i was drawn to the catholic church more for the symbolism and the sacramental aspect of things that just felt so
442.02,459.54, to my nature being a kind of a creative person myself a writer songwriter you know singer let panting it just felt it felt more natural to me to find an expression of my own faith in that in that environment so
459.57,467.31, we found out after i found out that don was actually going to start going to the catocalae and
467.31,471.51, i decided to embrace him he embraced the journey with him
471.54,472.56, and
473.04,480.36, because i wanted to understand what it was he was going to be doing but i also wanted to go into it with an open enough mind that
480.48,484.89, i felt that it was something i could embrace too that we could do it together
484.95,493.65, it was mainly for the understanding of it but as a protestant i realized the more i learned about what the catholic church really believed what they really teach
493.65,497.25, i didn't have anything to protest
500.76,506.43, i think one of the things that really appeal to me
506.79,514.5, but the catholic church one of the things politeness ion were the ephemeralities was built into
514.62,531.39, structure of the church it wasn't like everybody was expected to be perfect it was like everybody expected to blow it and so you know we can all have a place to go when we when we need to talk about that when we need to make our confession and feel forgiven
532.14,544.11, romans at the talks about you know all things work together for good for those who love the lord in a called according to his purpose and then i also love the very simple verse that says jesus wept
544.47,545.55, cause
545.73,560.82, one thing that i felt so much as i was going through all of my struggles was that jesus was understanding what i was going through somehow and the fact that he was so human that he could express those lithuanians and feel those human feelings
561.75,570.54, and since said coolly oleanders
571.02,573.03, he
573.03,577.5, as the walls
577.62,580.26, and
580.38,583.23, and stand
