362.16,363.6, the argument 
363.72,365.34, in fact
365.4,369.33, but for some reason as i do like the roman
369.57,374.25, i make sure his pressing to see that it's a sort of contact but it's 
374.34,375.6, you know

493.95,495.03, away in the
508.71,509.61, as
509.76,511.26, i see
520.5,522.84, individual feels a
525.03,527.34, as
542.88,545.04, you
545.22,548.61, the cases making the point
549.84,554.97, i install constructed yes doncastre in her view
555.33,558.57, when she's been by social constructed
558.81,564.03, but he thinks that then just because we socially constructed demean that there constructed
564.48,565.8, same way
566.67,568.41, recalcitrations
569.04,577.68, she thinks that ordinarily understand what's going on we can as it were plates things outside of their contact there is to contract
578.07,580.08, look at how this sort of
580.26,582.09, how basis
582.21,584.07, rising just course
584.28,590.25, all his darlaston on with it when wisitor acacis
590.64,592.5, the history of

596.37,599.97, terentia practice
602.7,607.14, context storm context or obtaining of
607.35,609.84, i think she said that sumption
609.84,611.97, so that one
612.48,618.66, because you both social imitated that therefore their changeable doesn't work because they can be socially inspected differently
620.07,621.18, i mean
621.69,624.24, baseball socially consented
627.15,629.07, all social constructed
629.58,634.41, he wears the getters of the fallen
636.24,642.15, i mean i mean you never have the work beriniere
645.9,656.43, he estimated you're also wearies and this is one of your point you worried about this thesis because you would bring it hangs the
657.21,660.54, sanitaetsrat logs and might not be
660.96,663.45, wainamoinen
663.45,669.45, the recesses at the rector would come up with john were
669.45,675.63, visionariness visages more like argument appointing you thought that
676.23,677.76, i
678.6,685.71, and so you look so as if you didn't know i insensed all the possible things that the regent might say
685.89,688.38, that her replies to these
688.47,690.24, things were poor
691.71,697.86, she disassociated really consider to except when they might 
699.93,703.62, and so if you are taken say to
705.0,707.91, i know 
708.03,709.05, i was
709.11,711.6, men not women say
711.69,721.41, not that sort annihilate this surgery about it astragon helped in waste
721.8,723.21, but
724.62,728.46, but think that it's almost become
729.87,731.43, i
734.91,737.01, sheridan
737.22,739.95, that is the cant into
740.67,746.37, repression passionate things are going to be
746.76,748.83, i intimated
749.52,751.71, significant ways
752.58,753.99, that
755.58,757.29, good example of that
758.31,760.95, discussion as to thinking about
764.22,766.8, the sight idea says
768.9,776.97, assessor
779.34,787.23, to and dependent upon and used by one man in her sexual relationships of the solution
787.59,793.47, become great way from this efficient spicion that is essentially certamente
797.34,801.3, culture of women that is independent of that where we love with
801.63,805.05, and women says here through a vision
805.26,807.78, is abstracted from saint
809.31,815.64, stratfordians as you have
818.07,819.69, i say
820.53,822.78, jacintha work for us
825.18,832.11, gentian relations of solidarity black man who
832.2,834.45, minuetto
835.35,840.96, you you inquisitive
841.02,842.19, where
844.44,846.66, for the other
846.93,848.52, and why
849.42,854.37, the last rag he is the point that i want to make is that
854.7,855.75, you 
856.08,857.01, even
858.03,860.43, account of general gassion
860.49,862.17, in savage
862.56,864.93, only about one
865.95,871.02, the nearabout tender and moving the terraces
872.76,875.85, represent itself as having anything to do with race
876.06,877.62, everything to do with race
879.78,882.27, and the disease race is
883.41,884.97, the thing sure
886.71,889.92, you're spending a theory or outlets
891.24,892.62, self
893.76,896.82, in a position to allow race to draw out the picture
898.53,904.71, i noisesome one who isn't of commiseration
904.95,911.07, tantalising rachel presentiments relevant
911.67,921.3, so you have so long ossinniboins even in cases in which it looks like his just about under not as about 
921.84,925.17, imperatorial power
925.23,927.66, says
928.17,932.49, about arising aratov
932.7,938.01, essares foresees what may i think that
939.09,941.82, those these days when say
941.91,946.11, this paying for the birds
946.38,953.43, not really fool and overheated is so disaway inmates things are
954.81,957.48, callaway were with each other
958.41,960.66, as
960.87,964.44, i think that this dream
966.45,970.08, estimates of the slanting
970.35,972.06, elliman
972.18,975.39, i mean the way in which you know historically speaking
977.52,980.73, stereotypes of also been generates
981.96,984.51, it was with
984.72,986.31, you
989.25,992.28, the oriental
992.31,997.92, i mean oh i antisthenes
1000.56,1004.07, an individual organism in masculine
1006.05,1009.47, have intersections of
1009.74,1010.97, as
1011.15,1014.36, penetrates seasons
1016.4,1018.8, so
1018.86,1023.6, the issue is as i think that certainly has
1023.96,1025.43, we had
1025.52,1028.22, it is interesting
1031.1,1034.64, happens on the left the mountains compare
1036.41,1037.58, and so
1038.42,1042.92, see and he is soon that they are they are analogous
1043.04,1049.82, she interested in people say as compared with facilities in 
1050.3,1052.73, something of acceptable
1052.73,1055.82, it may chance
1059.06,1062.24, this
1066.56,1069.95, soon there we can abstract
1070.22,1072.74, gender abstract gender from race
1073.13,1074.45, the parson
1079.58,1081.29, no
1083.96,1087.2, the great complain you remember but to
1089.48,1093.11, the democratic primaries
1093.26,1095.69, aminta
1097.58,1101.0, representations it was so like pitting
1101.66,1105.35, on raising it as against superintended
1108.86,1113.66, as under
1113.78,1121.61, what he did was by focusing on maeragenes then raised her lighthearted under gracefulness
1123.5,1128.96, rebelling outraged arithmetic that
1129.26,1133.85, toleration to have attempted it ran
1142.88,1147.41, in separateness
1147.65,1155.75, i mean i wanted say that because i don't think that it is taught logical passions but the other
1155.84,1158.9, just because evangeline
1161.39,1167.84, doesn't follow from that of transepts is utterly politically acceptable and says
1171.11,1174.02, look at history of race
1174.44,1176.6, i raised
1176.87,1179.75, it is a heavy center
1179.84,1184.79, may be different from the way which you know discourses ground
1184.85,1193.25, rieseneck are alone raised in the contractile different times
1194.18,1196.13, i 
1198.65,1203.3, negotiations
1203.33,1206.0, yes but 
1206.06,1208.7, i will tottie
1210.47,1212.33, suppose
1212.48,1213.92, take
1215.81,1218.63, waigiou this deal on
1221.78,1226.13, lola
1226.13,1227.63, so
1227.66,1230.9, he
1232.19,1233.33, you know
1234.68,1236.39, that 
1236.69,1241.07, i really feel one
1241.07,1242.6, so i think
1242.81,1245.03, historians
1247.67,1251.06, his present
1254.57,1259.01, eighteen take us to logically
1260.27,1263.03, jumped into the hazardous
1263.06,1265.43, they would be the
1266.54,1269.3, total
1271.76,1275.51, i don't i don't i don't feel like i want to
1275.81,1277.88, all
1279.95,1282.02, defensible responses
1284.09,1288.56, illustration of particular concern to you
1290.42,1292.85, and make interruption
1293.78,1294.62, and
1297.17,1298.76, i
1300.2,1308.63, i think it goes on the concern that may be a test is not sensitive enough to historians
1310.01,1312.35, another concern that i have
1312.41,1317.33, may have thought a little bit uncomfortable with his permanent different she knew
1317.51,1318.95, some of the pieces we looked
1319.01,1320.84, out of this point
1321.08,1326.87, and those of you who are familiar with philosophy and most of you here are philosophers
1328.25,1331.58, this arranmore like a philosophy never
1332.54,1339.8, for analogy paper so it seemed wrong reasonably paper
1339.95,1341.84, i think the interest
1342.95,1344.66, we talk a little bit about that
1349.1,1352.64, this one is a dragon for historical
1353.09,1354.74, and to
1354.74,1356.9, of a hypothetical
1357.11,1359.45, aspasia
1361.67,1364.37, seemed to exist in the same way that
1364.4,1367.7, as does the less considered as a hypothetical
1368.09,1373.67, philosophy teaspoonful with considering that deseases
1374.81,1382.46, the maiden their famous latin to hemispheres like into it correspond by whose
1382.61,1385.94, hypotheses
1387.65,1391.67, what of my desirability
1392.6,1397.52, why is it bother me or what is this certain man fell little bit uncomfortable
1397.97,1401.9, a little capable because
1402.92,1408.56, still the transactions as a case study to
1409.64,1411.8, almost ontological
1413.54,1420.38, i mean that intermitter me translations is hypothetical transactions misalliance
1421.97,1427.46, congratulate unpuzzled hopocon siding with the cases
1428.51,1431.15, consider a position
1435.5,1437.39, now what asked
1437.78,1441.05, this class was
1441.08,1442.58, but 
1442.79,1448.76, and so back to the tune of the overall warburton behind his father
1450.8,1458.54, you're doing this frosty in your writing is lost what is the goal behind his philosophy what is the
1458.9,1461.6, and his replicated
1467.42,1473.87, because because it is a sin in point to investigate things
1475.31,1479.72, alyosha in a hospitalisation
1479.9,1483.5, we may come up with considerant arguments
1483.95,1487.46, critical situations
1495.56,1497.3, i worry about that
1498.83,1502.31, but that were that as the political project
1502.79,1505.07, we talking about
1505.07,1507.17, eventually
1507.35,1508.97, to experience
1510.41,1513.2, while insipience
1515.42,1520.55, yes this is me back to the vengeance of doing very
1522.56,1524.15, here about
1524.39,1525.23, now
1525.86,1529.58, whose interests are being served by very
1529.82,1532.4, i never in mine
1533.93,1541.28, it's all a toss lovelier in toledo
1541.52,1545.03, you know this is a crust it
1545.75,1546.89, however
1547.94,1550.34, i don't know that it's cleugh
1550.7,1552.74, political enough
1552.95,1556.13, anita
1560.15,1566.75, stately transactions is being used as a test case tried italicise
1567.38,1570.68, mishtress conditional if that
1571.34,1573.14, not learning
1573.32,1574.67, helps
1575.48,1577.19, hansel
1578.69,1584.93, so then i started to still like an sexual transactions being harnessed
1587.78,1589.7, fortune
1591.71,1595.4, before really hard but
1595.82,1598.88, being sensitive to ways in which
1599.12,1601.76, people have been traditionally objectified
1601.85,1603.35, there is an
1603.41,1604.43, you know
1604.55,1606.89, so bessie
1608.06,1612.74, a very sensitive to the use of transactions kind of life
1613.43,1619.31, i castagnettes in cooper that has not felt
