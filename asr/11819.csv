0.0,6.27, this is a long form video designed to help you build a rag around the pentatonic th for
6.78,15.24, talk about lenses the finders mounting options and audio trying to find the most affordable way to rig it up to the highest technical standards
16.32,30.66, been well over a year since the four rived to market and it was pretty revolutionary at the time for shooting for a video internally into this compact camera that was built for the masses but also a real possibility for cinematographers
31.08,33.48, i had gotten one of the launch units
33.6,47.73, that week i shot and edited the first professional independent short film putting it through some challenges in the course of one day running around chicago mostly hand held putting the camera through variety of techniques shooting in force
47.91,60.72, find a link to the complete video in the caption and you can try watching it in full force at you be looking back on this video sort of amazes me how well the gh for has held up after more than a year
60.81,73.86, and it seems like it still has a lot more life left especially with the log finally on the way but i've learned a few things and settled on a good rig by now and won't necessarily be right for you but it's a fair place to start
74.34,137.61, when you think of building a rig lenses on the first thing that comes to mind but they're certainly the most important and with the micro for thirds lens mount of the pentatonic he for these three lenses are sort of on the leader board of what you want to have with you at all times they are native lenses not for the value of autos but because all three of them have power is which is in lands image stabilization which is really important if you ever go hand held and then these two soon lenses the thirty five to one hundred millimeter and twelve to thirty five millimeters they both have continuous two point apertures which is important for video because as soon you don't have to change exposure to compensate for a changing aperture they also weather sealed and have held up for me under the most extreme conditions but between two somedeal prime and the licorne although very expensive is a tax saplana the way open at a very bright of one point to
137.97,140.94, you might also want cinema prime lenses
141.69,146.79, have the value of wide barrels for more accurate focusing hard stops
147.0,149.97, and a continuous aperture without clicks
150.18,160.23, but the way that the lens mounts work with these seminaries lines is that the taller one you see on the right is with an adapter
160.32,169.23, for micro for this and the reason is is because a micro for thirds lens has a shorter flange distance from the censor
169.53,174.78, what that means is that it needs to be spaced farther out for the optics to focus correctly
175.17,192.84, on the left is the exact same millimeter cinema prime lends but made for cannon if now and the point of all this is to recommend that you always get the cannon he voters on of a cinema prime lens because that shorter flanges and give you more room to adapt to other lands for mats
192.84,198.45, reason for this is because cannoniers always had the censor set farther back
199.14,221.37, the benefit of adapting cannon lenses is that many of them are full frame and during that process of adapting the different lens mount sizes you can take advantage of that space to get a fugal reducer which takes a full frame lens and direct more light unto the small or censorship thirds to increase brightness and enlarge your fiance
222.0,264.36, the great features of the echo is its old bright high resolution do finder and that apart from the touch screen that flips out below this behind her had a pretty standard rubber i peace that came off pretty easily easy to get lost as this one did and i was always looking for something that would have a larger size to add a reasonable third point of contact with the face but provide enough give so that it would be flexible enough to not absorb all the shock coming from the face some one has finally invented it that fits very snugly on the death for without modification and it's called the ceco just out in the past month you can order it at a link in the caption
264.39,267.6, but to cover all the bases before coming back to him
268.17,311.55, there was a sort of day approach to coming up with an ip and it involved piecing together a product from asia that came with a bunch of different adapters that you could use for different cameras that basically spaced out this small simple i piece farther away from the viewfinder which resulted its in cropping of the image and just it wasn't an ideal solution i mean i made the best of it by finding this could i i peace which was made for neobule any of them and just simply tossed the adapter the came with it and then hook on the adapter that came with the much simpler i piece even so it still suffered from the same cropping because it was extending the rubber piece out too far from the viewfinder
312.03,330.6, this sort of thing there's always the code who make great products and taking the approach of using the larger back panel display as the finder itself the finders i found actually suffered from the same problems of cropping and also being a big cumbersome to mount every time you wanted to use the specialized refiner
330.9,354.12, i try something a little day with the finder that custom made for the black magic pockets and a camera and that type actually uses and adhesive frame that simply sticks on to the back of the black magic pocket and here you can see that it just snaps on instead of requiring a frame and a bracket underneath on the death for it almost worked but not quite
354.27,365.97, after all that rear strain flipped out so it's not a stable place to snap so strongly on the finder also you had to do a little carving into the plastic and that's just a kind of an uneasy thing with electronics
366.36,374.61, so what we were waiting for all this time was something built specifically for the g that would fit perfectly like a glove and not get lost
374.73,380.76, i actually fits just perfectly along all of the contours of the definer
380.85,401.34, adds that critical point of contact with the face to complement the hands holding the grip and the lens but also is flexible enough that it doesn't absorb all the body movements coming from the face and sent its custom made to sit close to the lines body itself there's no cropping of the image which is especially great for eyeglasses who might be farther away
401.7,415.74, you were wondering what those little red disks were hanging off each side of the camera the called anchor links and their sort of like the quick release plates of the camera strap world i think this is worth mentioning when we're talking about rigging because
415.77,424.53, sophy is increasingly mobile were using small cameras sometimes more than one body between the worlds of still photography and ideograph
424.56,441.99, with this system all you need or those little light weight and expensive discs hanging off the edges of each of your camera bodies and then the adapter hooked on to the one strophanthus with all of them i like this heavy leather company in this way i have a really nice strap that i can use on all my cameras
442.74,483.66, a prior video that i'm winking to here i had laid out all of the rigging options with respect to power issues inclusive of black magic sonia pentatonic cameras the focusing now just on the hour this is the adamus power station and it accomplishes several objective for the ghor even though the case for his great battery life to begin with but for that extra mile it not only lets you have continuous power between two batteries mounted here on the back of the unit that threads underneath the body of the gout also it let you use sonny elsie's batteries which have more capacity and also are more universal
483.81,499.53, you can even swap one out while the other one still there for continuous power and the way this is possible is there is a little hole to the side of the battery compartment and through that hole a wire goes in to a dummy battery and then the latch can firmly shut around it
499.92,511.86, and then this wire terminates in a barrel connector that in turn goes into the back of the power station delivering power to the hour as if the battery were in the unit
512.25,523.38, central thumbscrew in the atom's power station can go into the under belly of the gate for that normally connected to a tripod or tripod plate
523.38,528.66, or the other option is you could mount it to the top of the ghor
528.96,534.96, in the end it's an optional way to ensure that you have continuous power with more capacity
535.2,538.65, as you use your perhaps in more studio environments
538.8,552.03, find that the display on the hotels you about how much battery power is left but it won't be as useful as the led indicators on the power station itself as this is only estimating what the dummy battery is providing
552.63,560.97, more thing about power is your ring might have accessories that take us power and you could use a simple mobile phone charger
560.97,580.14, provide strong bus power to any of these devices this is the dirty d but the dear seventy d which is the next generation audio recorder has a micro us b input that can take power to compliment its batteries or even replace them as long as you select but power from the menus
580.47,628.32, get back to audio and a couple of minutes but when it comes to building a rag i suppose the first thing that comes to mind is this thing it's called a cage and the pieces of the cage are what have often been called jests which is a bunch of screwin holes that are mounting points for you to mount accessories around your camera you're looking at a product by devos and it's us based company that really sort of nailed it in terms of providing plenty of cut outs to access all the features of the camera once it's in place it's better than other products that i've seen on the market from erivan or continuo few factor i've added a few accessories that didn't come with the cage that i felt were necessary including a standard hutcheon and a fifteen mile meter rail mounting point
628.53,632.61, i have added links to these additional accessories in the caption to
633.6,650.82, important feature here that the other cages don't have is this pair of insulated posts not only firmly set your camera into the exact position it needs to be but also prevents it from twisting and place and there's also an integrated day walk on the side of the cage for strain relief
651.21,687.21, the camera into the cage those two post tell you where to stop but there's two more things you have to do and they involve screws from the bottom and the top of the cage into the camera it uses the hot she mounts of the g for itself and you slide this red bracket into place and then screw down so that it solidly connects the camera with the top of the cage and then at the bottom of the cage it simpler because you just simply are screwing the same size screw the you would use on a tripod plate to connect the cage with the base of the camera
687.27,695.31, once you've tied up the record you still have access to the scared all of the ports and the battery without having to do any disassembly
695.34,728.07, another distinct feature of this so called decade by de focus is that you can actually see the mode selector dial through a hole in the cage others simply weirdly don't have that i added a rail by acute top of the cage and that is actually a standard nato rail mount that other manufacturers also make products for and another essential part of any right it from a top handle for a variety of reasons including sturdiness and mounting points so that's what ye see here
728.31,797.79, this has got to be the tiniest and cheapest tip it is basically an end to end one quarter inch twenty and three eights intew that you can use for more mounting options and you see it here on the cage but next to it you also see this thing called in articulating arm which basically has one dial in the middle that ends up controlling the tightness of all of the joints in the product and is an extremely useful weight amount accessories which takes us to another option that makes his use of this fifteen millimeter rod mounting point there are a lot of different things that you can use to connect with rods and of course the gisors perfectly paired with the animus shogun for high bit erecting and high quality monitor so here you see the additional fifteen military with a variety of different angles to mount that another thing that i had recommended with the black match of pockets cages this product by tatersal the jerk stopper and i just simply complements the strain relief that already comes with age with yet another strain eyes
797.88,879.96, and that inevitably includes audio some moving on to that part of your rig there's one product that is sort of a luxury item but i just can't resist recommending it i had done a full video review of it and here some footage of that paired with the decade using that hot shoot accessory that i added on to it it's the road stereo video mike pro hac and as it turns out the ghor does seem ideal a sort of a camera for a lot of different types of productions where you would be wanting to capture more ambient sound than anything targeted that you would get from a shot down so for that purpose this is there is nothing better on the market for capturing extremely high quality stare you can visit the other video to hear audio samples of it but as for the general issue of getting audio into the churn the stereo video mike pro there is a gain control setting where you can basically bump up the premature any microphone such as this one connected to the chouan this becomes important because one flaw the hour is that its audio prancer fairly noisy so the strategy is to go into the menus as undoing here and to go to your mike level adjustment and actually do take it all the way down and start there at least and see whether or not you can get your game up to acceptable levels through the microphones own output if you can do that then you save yourself a lot of noise
880.2,945.03, here is the stereo video mike pro mounted on the entire rig and you can see that it's a great run and gun way to capture ambience for great be rollet if you do want to have a more professional solution there is the task can dear seventy d and you can actually mount any camera including this whole rig on to the base of the dear seventy d and what it ends up providing to your rig is high quality fantom power colorado and puts it even has back up internal microphones you could take the stereo video might protect put it straight into the dear seventy you could do duality could also do the four tracks on the deer seventy d it simply expands dramatically or options and what's exciting about this is that it used to be requiring a much larger form factor than what you see here so this combination basically gives you the audio options that you normally would get with a professional camera you might have to sink and post but there's also a slave button on the front panel of the door seventy d that let you sing things much easier
945.39,957.99, rounding out your rig after talking about stereo capture what's even more common is directional audio and using an accessory like this we can screw down a shock mound which is a simple product
958.05,987.39, basically suspends any shock on microphone in rubber bands so that the movements of the body are insulated from the microphone itself i'm recommending here the road and to or four because they have twin capabilities of outputting high quality balanced color audio or into the simple unbalanced one eighth inch in put on the jodrey you can also directly record audio internally without having to sink in post
987.39,994.56, wrapping up this may not necessarily be the rig for you but it's a fair place to start and yet you might have the question
994.56,997.65, when start if the horse
997.8,1005.54, aonadat arrives in the next few weeks the theme is that it's going to reinvigorate the product into something new
1005.93,1020.51, that remains to be seen but what we can say about rigging is that it's become increasingly madula what works for one camera will usually work for another so apart from any cage or view finder that custom made just for the hour
1020.57,1026.6, i think the theme too is that whatever you do for the decor you can use for the next thing that comes along
