0.09,37.29, the
38.34,56.55, appreciate it yeah my name's michael iron gray killala where we make the applications and software for cinema but luis and he also do banana camera company which is like this pomaree make your photos all messed up but we'll talk about that later
57.03,60.96, what i want i thought about created mornings i watch all these
61.08,105.75, morning on all around the world now they have all these cities and my favorite stories are from people that are kind of in a certain part of their career and they wanted to make a transition into the next part of their career and they tell that story on how it works and how it didn't work and if it was difficult of thistlethwaite stories so i figured a little boy as well as far as that goes he went on was happiness it even more perfect because i think that dry from being somewhat satisfied to trying to be more satisfied in any creative career is driven by doing more of what makes you happy so i think this will help out a lot
105.78,143.4, and so i hope to just give you a little bit of a story on how i ended up where i was kind of like percent happy and how i tried to transition into a career and to do work that made me more like you know i'm still working on it so it all starts when i got my first job when i was fifteen that's kind of the age that my parents decided ethel out get a job they still had me after house i'm not saying get out but to get a job you almost have a car like garryowen just got a job at some place that would hire me
143.64,156.06, it made more sense to me to go one of my into what can i do what do i like doing anyway and what can i do learn on the job and do it even when i was i said but i want to work in clothes i didn't want to work in food and i didn't want to work with kids
156.3,170.88, i was fifteen you know kids and food and in one i wouldn't want the typical like fifteen year old job so i went to the mall which is where you go when you're in the suburbs at detroit growing up to get a job and start walking around looking at like where
170.88,210.06, i would want to work and wanted to work at the record store it was really in music i was really you know i was playing a guitar and piano and all that stuff i wanted to work at maybe the science store they had all those cool like toys and you know stuff to play with and books about space and stop at their womenkind tenements into at the time but i walked in kopatree at them all though they haven't always been there in dating myself but the kohistanees up and one theatrics
210.45,218.73, and i go i want to work there so i walked up to him there was a little sign it was perfect and said were hiring and i walked up and he goes you know
218.88,231.21, imagine so yet cards i pulled it out and memorized them all you know from the crafty books he get it toys or as or like you know those little kit with the hat and the crapaudine couple of them
231.3,284.82, he said you you know learn these tricks and my first job was standing in the middle of the mall approaching people walking to go by real stuff and then saying hey you want to see a magic trick doing a trick and then they go how do you do that and i go willoughby could buy them at derouchette first of a few jobs when i was younger growing through high school and college where i was mostly doing work that i like doing was working to pull this off you know i was in the music so i ded up doing a lot of bjork and playing music at weddings and bars and stuff was really you know it pangerango with a red label to record some of their bands
285.09,292.29, and through this magic things or doing things like you know kids birthday parties and dressing up like a clown and some stupid stuff like that but
292.35,294.06, somewhere around you know
294.3,308.43, early when i should have been in college basically i graduated high school and i kind of screwed off for a couple a couple years ended up in vegas for no reason living there and kind of had some ado in this and that didn't know what to do my parents wanted
308.61,315.75, go to college but i didn't know what that thing was that i could go study for four years you know i kind of
315.9,343.02, i didn't know what that was until i saw this animation on late night this weird channel i think they bought up like public access time or something that's called berlin bear and they showed all these art films and music finds weird is like prebaudet eventually they would show all this crop and one of the things that they played was this film by the log flipped up
343.35,370.8, said presents man of action and it showed five minutes of the coolest things i've ever seen it was the short film and it wasn't quite filmed the wasn't filled with a camera right it wasn't like a video thing and it wasn't hand drawn animation it was this new thing i didn't really know what to what it was called and it was like phocaean and there was the animation there was the flying everywhere there were cards moving around and it was
371.01,378.3, was exactly everything i loved about a lot of things and at the end it said made by mc twelve
378.6,381.57, i wrote that down and i said may with after effects
381.75,385.35, that down and i looked up what after effects was and that was it for me
385.35,387.45, the next five years of my life
387.57,407.52, i cut all the events all the best and that beshmet all the beasts i can find all the stuff on line i could find a learn this thing i was obsessed came here to chicago to go to school to learn after facts said to learn motion graphic that i find found out what it was called and
407.94,411.51, ended up in in
411.99,415.11, job that dennis
415.2,431.49, no around the city and learned a lot and ended up a digital kitchen which actually used to be right right around here and to me working a digital kitchen was the best place in chicago to do what i wanted to do i like their work i like the style of their words i liked
431.61,439.38, you know the poor folio of work was right in line with the kind of stuff that i was into and
439.53,441.15, i was working there
441.15,445.23, when i realized that these last four or five years
445.32,450.87, i should have been also studying something else and that something else
450.96,455.37, really really evident when i started looking at what i was making
455.49,471.36, starting comparing it to the end and the digital kitchens of the world i knew every button of after effects i studied it i learned it i read the manual read the books i followed all the tutorial what i didn't learn was any design concepts
471.51,506.25, i didn't know i didn't know and i didn't care frankly i didn't get into this to be a designer i didn't get into this torn about typography i didn't get in all this stuff because i needed to learn hierarchy i didn't care about that stuff i just wanted to make what was on t and they said they use the after effects and now i knew after effects why was my shoul and when i compared it you know there's that iron last thing where he says there's the gap between where you are and where your heroes are and when you look at that gap it and can be discouraging and say i you know
506.73,521.94, going to compare my work to my heroes and when you do that it can be really kind of really suck especially when you're working in the same room with them but the best part about that was that i was in the same room with them and they were willing to look at my stuff and go
522.09,551.58, only first of all and and they were willing to say why it was ugly not how to fix it because anybody can go he changed this type face to this make this color here do this and now it's beautiful good job but that's just them designing through me right they told me why it was ugly they told me don't use eighteen type faces in it don't use common sands dummy don't use that last so typeface ah you know like i didn't know these things
551.97,560.34, you know bright orange and bright green don't put those together even though i guess today i codille
561.42,567.48, they were willing to they were willing to share their knowledge and tell me why and
567.96,575.25, i think that i think that's good advice no matter where you are in the new york career is don't be the best one in the room
576.15,594.87, go somewhere that you can learn from other people to be somewhere where you can be a little humble by somebody else that's great because for me that was the best part anthesteria was the quickest i've learned anything in my life was that ocampo people around me that were talented telling me
594.9,602.16, why i sucked and it was awesome i learned so much so i slowly got better if still you know
602.31,619.68, still i basically a cheat now i used to type faces ever basically but sitting at a digital kitchen we got to work on some really cool stuff i got to work in moving title sequences and ten shows stuff and stuff for the super bowls stuff my mom would actually see this was cool i made it right
620.04,629.64, and meanwhile i was still doing all this other stuff and this is where this is where it starts to shift from the traditional career
631.53,636.87, kind of graduating and then going to work in the typical thing so
636.9,658.65, you know your guidance counselor college water would say you know you can go free lance you can go work out a bigger agency type place or you can go workfolk a smaller boutique place like digital kitchen or you know somebody more specialized and those were kind of the three pontenelle and
659.01,678.48, right around that time as when i started realizing there were other ways to play around with all this stuff because honestly my favorite part about all this was playing with after effects and then i got into the and then playing around with cinnamon those were the most unavailing what all these tools can do and how to make beautiful stuff
678.54,686.88, that's why i did that's why i got into this i saw i saw the captain i said i want to make that and it's still struggling to get there
686.91,695.73, been the whole thing but i didn't get into this to make work for clients necessarily they just happened to be paying you know
695.76,699.93, so right around that time a few things happened that lined up
699.99,716.73, allow me to think about things a little bit differently and i think this comes up a lot and a lot of people's careers is i got to where i wanted to go i am working at a place where i thought i wanted to work and i'm still not percent happy
717.0,722.91, you know some of the things aren't great maybe it's the clients maybe it's people who work with maybe it's
723.03,744.36, not being you know you being the best in the room and not having anybody to warn you feel like you're stagnant you going sideways and a few things happen so the first thing to happen was this website popped up in that i didn't know existed of called stockpot and it's just a stock photography thing but somehow that was the first one i saw and what they said was he plods
744.72,761.16, if we approve an we're goin to put them in our store and if anybody bustin anybody searches for your photo and they find value and what you loaded they can buy it and will give you a percentage basically will give you a couple of times and that was interesting to me i could do work now
761.34,765.99, maybe get paid later that in an me as a career option
766.05,773.28, and i stop with his really weird way that to try it without too much risk right and the cool part was i had photos
773.37,784.98, i took i started a photo blog nourish where i posted a photo a day so i had my camera around me all the time i took photos of everything and great photos
784.98,792.9, cappy mostly crappos i posted the good one right one day found my favorite one i posted it but what i had was his hard drive
793.02,799.59, full of other photos that i didn't necessarily want to put on my blog
799.59,814.8, i thought might be useful to somebody you know the typical like stuff you shoot when you start being a photography like building building building sunset water cab driving by a shadow in the grass right so
815.1,843.39, look through my so i made it a project i said i'm going to go through all my photos and i'm going to look forward stuff that might be valuable to other people some of it was textures of bricks and grass and all the stuff so i just started kind of putting those aside processing them cleaning them up a loading to the side of a edentate and i checked back a few days later and there was like five bucks in the account and it took a week end and then a week later there was five bucks and i thought well that's cool
843.45,853.47, i did work here and did not then necessarily get paid but now i five bucks and was really cool they theoretically if i don't do anything for another week there might be five more dollars in there
853.74,856.71, i don't have to trade an hour
856.8,858.81, for an hour's pay
859.14,861.9, in trade an hour for potentially
862.41,877.95, limited pay on the future and it was just a really small subtle difference to think about it that way but that change the way i thought about my creative work and in that i can go do stuff by already bid art like doing going and walking out shooting photos and potentially
877.95,882.36, share those with other people and if there's value in that in that photo
882.42,897.54, potentially get paid on that photo or that work later and what i didn't realize is that like you know what business do you know that's what most like entrepreneur kind of things that but those weren't words are my head i just wanted to make pretty stuff on 
897.78,920.07, so when i stock turned into adding video at blew up from me i was gone i was like imminent now i'm going to think about all these cool things i can animate and learn and there was also the perfect learning tool to learn cinematic was what i was really into at the time as well as after facts was this new threat to all that i wanted to just learn and play with so what i would do on the weekend is
920.19,929.31, make this low go spin around i'm going to make the world rotate in dandtan's going to be my stock thing that apotheke and i would sit and learn cinema
929.52,935.52, enough to figure out how to make a world rotate and make it and then do it and then up load it and see what happens
935.97,973.68, so that was going on at the same time this grace called relish which was my photoplay added like a secondary blow to it where i started talking about how i took photos i talked about how it did after effectual about my job and talked about how i how work is it a digital kitchen and all that kind of stuff that was taken that was growing in importance to me i loved talking to other people on it i was doing to trials with for after effects and all this stuff so that was a little segment of it and i also the phone came out and the asininity the astor came out
973.68,982.56, that's when i looked at all these photography as an said i want to make that i mean i've been trying to emulate film
982.71,988.98, through photo shop for two years you know ever since i started getting in photography and playing with film
989.04,998.01, was like i know i can make this work i know i can make you know film i know i can make a filter in potshot at makes it look more like film because it's so beautiful so i had
998.1,1007.31, had the filter is ready to go in the phone came out and looked at it and i saw all these kind of crappy photo maps pop in up i said i want
1007.37,1021.59, filter and anadi do that so i hired a developer and it wasn't too much money i said i'm going to try this this is like the first time i'm not just trading time for potential palate i was actually putting money down and saying i'm going to put money down that
1021.74,1023.33, we are going to build this
1023.6,1025.34, same with the store
1025.52,1026.9, to build at once
1026.9,1030.53, potentially if there's value people can buy that over time
1030.56,1031.43, and
1031.46,1039.32, you can and you don't have to trade that hour for an hour's pay or a day for a day's pay or a project for a project to pay
1039.83,1053.81, and that so that happened and then the real the key that turned the whole thing was at the same time around two thousand four five all these other companies and people started talking about the transition from client work
1053.9,1072.68, making stuff for themselves so and all in chicago so i was you know guy like jim cal could all partners who talked to create a morning jason free even signals and even jake from threadless they all stood up here and said we had that transition from
1074.6,1086.48, from kind of more client work traditional and moving into work that we wanted to do for yourself and that was the key that turn it because what i saw was if they they can do that
1086.96,1095.27, then i can do that i'm really a subscribe this is a little cheese but i'm super like some scribe to the idea that what one man can do another can do
1096.08,1108.11, bacon do that and transition out of litoribus they weren't percent happy and they thought they could have more control and how more fun doing it the way i thought i could do this so all for these things lined up in a way
1108.2,1109.73, made me look at
1110.06,1116.24, my career i guess or my path on this and i decided that i wasn't
1117.32,1119.18, i needed to make a change
1119.57,1123.56, wanted to spend more and more time on the projects that i liked
1123.77,1127.79, less and less time on some of the projects i didn't like doing that my job
1128.0,1133.25, i was percent happy there i got to work with great people i got to work
1133.46,1141.47, and learn a lot but those little things about clients and all the little stuff i didn't like i thought i could take a chance so i did i laughed
1141.56,1160.25, i kitchen in with the idea that i wasn't going to take any client work for a year and if all be blew up in my face i knew that i could either crawl back to tea and ask for my job back or if they wouldn't have me may be somebody else in the city but the risk at that point was just trying it it was a year
1160.52,1175.07, if again if everything blew up by new as long as my arm didn't get cut off in the process i could go use my acompanied make stuff for other people so i did i laughed and in the last three years grace skilled grill is gone from a community of
1175.07,1183.29, you know inmates and after effects artists to now a business where i make software and plug ins for those people to use in their work
1183.62,1195.44, the phone banana came a company was at the phone business we've worked on that and made up grades to the current ones were working on a new application and that's a blast to play with
1195.83,1196.79, and
1196.85,1200.15, now get to work with all my friends that are doing creative work
1200.15,1210.86, office of the road here and they get to i get to learn from them for it's this whole process of not being the best in the room and growing through that so
1210.98,1214.43, i wanted to tell one more story think like
1214.55,1222.02, tenaciously story but i think it is in all this 
1223.85,1225.05, year
1225.11,1226.76, really independent
1226.76,1229.91, thinking it and
1230.0,1242.93, always played it when i was younger but somehow last year i got the book and i started like learning about them and this happens all the time with other with other things in my life i'll really i'm in this something and then i realize it
1243.05,1244.4, man made this
1244.64,1257.69, everything around you like the projector and the strain and the computer like people were involved with this and this i have this realization i need that like get the tattoo me like everything around us is made by people
1257.87,1262.94, interest in and making that thing so when i found out that actual men man timochis
1263.03,1291.59, like i needed to know all my favorite designers of pimichin there's different styles of machines the different rules rules set based on who made it there's different games based on what companies made it there's the history of the designer's coming through there's rock started designer pinball machine dies leaves got i was heights started collecting games we have eight of em now the office we would have more if we had more room
1291.98,1294.59, i started
1294.8,1313.64, talking about this public you know like being all ernaut if you like did you know people like names and writing that and sharing this on twitter you know on post my high score in a local bar and say somebody come beat it suckers and then and what happened was i got a phone call i've got a phone call from a guy he said he
1313.67,1323.45, i think we want your help were building a pimichin where a brand new pinball machine company and were building our first emotion we want you to help
1324.05,1325.1, i go
1326.45,1329.03, how can i help
1329.15,1335.33, i don't know anything about the machines and they said well we have the first pimichin where the t in the back of it
1335.39,1341.06, the little red dots any more we want a full that in the back glass
1341.09,1343.88, plays full reanimation
1344.18,1345.32, during the game
1345.35,1357.92, we heard that your inanimation after facts and all the stuff which we need and we also heard your really nerina pemba and i said hackett was my first
1357.92,1362.99, a client in i left and i had to say yes
1363.29,1364.1, and
1364.34,1375.83, i went and so i worked on it and the owner of the company was really proud of his first game and its coming out soon and he was so proud of everybody that helped on it that he had everybody signed their name and he put it on the game
1376.55,1378.65, now i went from
1378.89,1380.36, getting into penal
1380.66,1384.05, putnam on a pine machine
1384.11,1385.19, a year
1386.72,1393.44, i say that not to brag although i think it's really cool but i say that because
1393.89,1399.5, being loud and passionate and showing other people what you are really into
1399.8,1401.06, never hurt
1401.48,1412.43, never i've never i've always benefited from being showing my passion too much of it being loud about what i like what i don't like and also offering help
1412.55,1418.16, people made the phone call when you get that call say yes answer and say i can help how can i
1418.25,1419.99, and i think that there's
1420.32,1436.79, i think i hear people talk about being in a creative space where they got an into it for one reason but now they're working in a space that kind of related to how they why they got into this in the first place but not quite maybe you really like to making posters and screen printing and now you're doing website stuff
1436.97,1446.03, bill talk about that scream printing still don't do that stuff let people know that this is still your passion even though your kind of sideways into it
1447.44,1450.65, this is also a little cheese but i really believe that
1450.86,1455.45, everything benefits by you guys doing exactly what makes you happy
1455.84,1458.0, the world the community
1458.06,1462.74, your friendships and you
1462.89,1473.6, benefit by you doing what makes you happy for a couple of reasons if you are in a job that doesn't make you happy get the hell out and let somebody else do it that does make it happy for them
1473.87,1481.82, the second thing is is you will make better stuff everything around us that men by humans by made by people by men
1482.03,1490.82, made by creative people that are interested and solve a problem and i think that that is the best thing you could do is go be happy
1491.03,1492.02, with that
1492.26,1496.37, having met
1499.82,1508.79, i detonators and i have a couple of questions for you before we went to the audiencia try
1509.12,1511.04, he had had from
1511.13,1516.47, no i need help guy i mean green orange it's bad
1516.47,1524.39, reentering that i really noticed as you told your story that you have this sense of
1524.45,1526.31, love learning things
1526.58,1535.4, on making things and the polish things i just love learning after effects openhanded burning after effects and that another four years learning 
1535.64,1537.83, no people 
1539.33,1540.71, you know 
1540.71,1546.35, but joy get for helping people for his learning about off to now
1546.53,1554.27, everything you know like whittaker you know i think that obviously learning stuff is
1554.36,1558.47, really find you get into that new project or that new thing or into and you start
1558.74,1622.94, start learning all this stuff and you get to this plateau of where you can't may be necessarily learn more about the actual software but then you have for me at least i have this another level i can use with that knowledge which is so other people and so if you if i can get to a level where i'm comfortable with my skill or enough to do it i can actually have more fun by showing other people the other thing the other thing about teaching listessly that i'm some rotha has been doing this for ten years and now i get to tell you it's like an a lot o cases with arterial and what we do i will learn a really cool technique that day that we've been working on for a week and then put them to toil out to morrow so it's like here's what i learned yesterday if not helps you guys even better so for me sharing and training and all that stuff has been half an excuse for me to remember it because i watch my own tutorial sometimes and but more but more away to share what i know and i've gotten more out of sharing what i know that holding on to it for sure
1623.51,1627.26, another thing that you know different with you and
1627.35,1629.42, the 
1630.89,1637.19, pronounced out how to make residual income what is that life
1638.63,1640.22, in
1640.31,1642.32, and i like to have
1642.8,1645.17, i 
1645.26,1648.29, you know from me it was
1648.62,1661.91, the stories are out there i am a product of all these stories from signals and coal and i'm a student of theirs whether they know it or not this knowledge of switching from
1662.24,1666.8, more traditional client base you know full time work to
1666.95,1668.0, coming
1668.21,1676.34, making stuff for yourself that all that knowledge is out there so for me it wasn't a magic light bulb moment it was learning from
1676.34,1692.99, these people that were willing to share that story with me and then following that advice and trying it something like i stocked photo was kind of a no risk thing it was some time to try and i tried it and traction was there so and you hear this
1692.99,1698.42, said by other these other people that say this you don't have to have to do a big jump
1698.42,1702.14, to try these things you could try this right now in your current situation
1703.04,1704.33, from the 
1710.42,1712.82, and i 
1721.91,1725.63, were
1730.28,1732.74, he
1739.49,1744.41, curiosities that i want to 
1749.87,1754.58, i thought curious in trying to get all the petitions
1756.71,1760.25, poor
1767.06,1774.41, yeah yeah absolutely i repeat the question for the audio i think the question i hope get it right
1774.71,1783.95, it talking about this stuff being interested like sharing your ideas on the stage how do you get better at that maybe
1783.95,1799.52, i like if you notice something that makes me happy is talking a lot so when i used to go to portfolio shows and stuff when i worked in digital kitchen we go look at new york and we always leave and sit at lunch and talk about
1799.55,1801.95, the things the students could have done better
1801.95,1829.31, get hired basically you know and the first speaking i did was basically on that subject like go to a school and say hey you're about you know you're just starting your graduating and how what makes you stand out when you graduate from this art school whatever and so for me i naturally had too many opinions about stuff and speaking i still get you know ostendere
1829.79,1862.37, slides kind of lock me into this really linear way of talking that kind of is less sporadic and maybe makes more sense at the end but its way less energy and i have i have more fun when there's no identity lebeau's off on wanganui makes sense and sometimes it does sometimes but i think the enchantress
1862.67,1871.13, many want to do this so for me you know having a couple of notes knowing maybe in general what you want to say is the way to to preach that
1885.2,1891.71, the question is have ever run into a place where i kind o get writers block or don't know what to make next
1893.21,1923.12, i do all the time i do not it's not a steady stream of stuff there is high energy times and there's times where it's just like i don't know i don't know what to do one thing one thing i finishing a deadline i always like when i had the photograph to a day i knew that by the end of the day i needed to post a photo so that got my brain going and that got me carrying my camera everywhere and also got me like really stressing out about taking a good photo
1923.15,1946.4, and so short deadlines for me help a lot so now we do a lot of software we do a lot of development we do a lot of little projects nothing longer than a week or two because you know i think long projects tend to like you and strew around for two weeks like if you have a month you scented then you work for two weeks so i just short it and below
1947.15,1954.56, either put out what is done at the end of two weeks or decide that it's not worth it and then move on so that's been our
1954.92,1958.37, internal at the company kind of the way that we work
1958.58,1961.37, and i think deadlines cure writers walk
1983.78,2004.78, so the question is do i do any client work and if not what would i do all day basically other than the malchin i haven't i haven't done any free lance client works since i left it as far as what we do at projects are
2005.05,2037.03, projects for us are sometimes based on that original idea of looking at something that we really like and we want to know how it's made so that's been a lot of what we do know at grace skill gorilla will find a commercial or an effect or some sort of interesting cool new thing that is that we want to know how to do and we'll sit for a week and try to dissect it and try to backsheesh
2037.03,2053.77, but bill bates will spend a week making not and then we'll put out a tutorial to show like some of the techniques that we've learned through the through that week basically that's been our internal project kind of system the other thing that we do we try to do a lot of
2053.86,2072.34, work and help our friends when they need a logo animation or when they need a little help with inamorato effects or whatever we kind of try to help out and then you know kenosha we helped out with so some of the things on the floor like he did this
2072.55,2081.58, this is what he had a problem with we kind of sat down and played with it and then now all of you guys are here to learn from it so any project now that we take isn't
2081.7,2085.6, give us money but allows us to
2086.17,2094.75, create training and learning from that experience and instantly get it out there so and as far as you know
2094.87,2102.58, the other stuff like the plug ins and all that stuff so we develop plug ins and software for cinema that's where
2103.24,2105.1, a time goes as well
2107.35,2110.86, in follow do you feel with
2115.24,2117.91, the question is when i jumped from
2118.42,2123.37, out of all time into my own thing how did i had i not stress out about money
2123.49,2129.28, and the way i did it was it wasn't just i decided to just jump out
2129.31,2132.25, just go i'm not percent happy in leaving
2132.31,2135.64, what i did was start to try those little projects
2135.79,2140.2, and things like i stock where money was starting to come in
2140.38,2148.45, i could look at my account and say you know now i have not just photos but now i have photos and animation
2148.51,2156.4, in the system and people seem to like them and by some of them and i could look at that and say that's definitely not my salary
2156.49,2160.84, i had some sort of cushion i also had a time line so if
2160.84,2161.89, i jumped
2162.04,2163.66, all went to hell
2163.69,2166.36, a time line that to go back
2166.36,2168.91, and i wasn't burning a bridge
2168.94,2174.13, just like leaving for a little bit so if everything went in everything really went south
2174.16,2183.46, go get a pay check again you know what i mean so that was that was helpful so having a little bit of a safety cushion to know that i could try this for a year
2183.52,2187.24, and then knowing that you can go back was as
2187.3,2190.06, i mean i really don't subscribe to the whole like
2190.27,2194.08, now and go figure it out things so i try those little projects
2194.23,2202.87, starters huge for this now i mean to try out a project and see what you can see what you can do with an idea and some friends
2202.9,2206.2, and then if that turns into something
2206.38,2207.79, a good transition
2209.11,2212.05, we got hold of you and follow up with all the things you and
2213.97,2224.62, well he can go to grace scolacutta follow me on the twitter yell at me or tell me my t shirt tucked at nice
2224.74,2226.0, on the twitter
2226.15,2233.56, and then you can go to my home my pin look gave me commonalty timidoque multi ball
2235.45,2238.93, but yeah hittite is probably the best
2240.13,2244.24, i
