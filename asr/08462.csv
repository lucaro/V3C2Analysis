0.03,11.01, we back to the dam video blog i madam daniel mathas again for watching august the eleventh twenty seventeen
11.28,18.69, as little bit about longevity and his orthos that know me very well now that every discipline type of a guide
19.17,23.46, i get a bit of very early hour i had the jim at a very early hour
23.64,27.81, routines that are sacrosanct that i don't like to violate that help me function
28.83,33.21, one of the things that i talked about earlier today the tripod of stability
33.57,36.3, in some of those concepts out the course of this log
36.87,49.95, for example there are places that i go to routinely where i'm known people know my name people see me people i know what i'm up to and so it's mostly older guys especially when you go to the gym at early hours
50.31,67.02, people get up earlier there's that say that i'm getting older because they get up earlier but let's not go there people generally getting up earlier in the day are older so they noticed me at the gym because generally when i go and work out i work out forty hard especially when i'm getting the bags there's a lot of noise
67.14,75.54, whether it's my fists that are hitting the bag or the bag actually racing or some of the breathing and granting that i do when i go into like some pretty intense combinations
76.05,76.95, so
77.7,80.64, are generally coming up to me in the locker room
81.0,83.28, and they're saying hey like
83.4,86.34, i used to box before i ring guy
86.4,91.68, you know like what's your deal why you boxing so hard you training for something
91.89,94.86, alice when those guys end up
95.04,97.41, you a compliment because you know that
97.68,104.31, all kind of like part of the same tribe you know we're all interested in maintaining our health we're all interested in being to shape
104.34,108.15, in staining our life and being here for a very long time
108.75,115.32, and so part of the reason why i work out so hard as because one of my missions is i want to be around to a hundred you know we have a little joke
115.44,121.62, to the second part which is you know there's some cafes that i go to his valorsine of the guys that are there no 
121.71,131.49, most of the older guys that i know that are like over the generally and people like my father for example who years old and it doesn't look a day over like 
131.76,133.2, you know
133.89,138.63, these types we all want to like be around for a long time myself included
139.38,147.51, and we always have like a little joke and we say like the types of things that we need to do to make sure that we can stick around for as long as we do in the gym i already mentioned is one component
147.99,152.13, and for me personally it's a thing that i put into my body the stuff that i eat
152.16,162.75, and i very conscious of the stuff that i put in there so you know i'm not a smoker i don't do drugs i like this rank every now and again i like to have a couple of bears you know that's kind of like one of my sort of like my little
162.75,168.12, pleasures but i do like once a week and i sure that it's in moderation and i generally do it with an activity
168.27,173.85, it's not just like me sitting there and like having drinks or like going crazy like i like to watch the game obviously people know
173.94,181.23, wild for baseball so it's baseball connection or if it's going out with somebody having you really good conversation to some beers but that's very sort of like
181.32,183.12, sparing type of activity
183.27,202.56, the things that go into your head the knowledge the books that you read it's very important to be careful what you're thinking about how you're thinking about effects very profoundly the opportunities that you pursue and how you conduct your day and how you associate with other people the space and i very conscious about the books that i read and i'm still conscious of reading a book a week
202.8,207.66, like one of the goals that i've had and i mentioned this before and videos in the past and
207.72,219.6, real books with real thoughts with sustain thoughts coach and thoughts you can read a book over the course of let's say however long you take streak whether it's a thick one over it a thin one you need a single
219.93,228.51, idea that contained within the course of several pages not just a little so the like snippets of information that you gobble like snacks you need a meal not a snack
228.96,231.0, and it's also like
231.3,233.76, types of people that you associate with
233.85,248.19, talk about this before on this log in previous iterations what's your five person outrage the five people that you spend the most time with they could be real people they could be virtual people that could be authors but only five people that you want your five person average to be very high
248.37,252.06, contribute to our overall life success and satisfaction
252.57,256.95, very important for me to have a longevity i want to be around for a very long time
257.19,269.13, see especially as my parents get older especially persons like my father and i'm watching him and i see how he conducts himself and i see the attitude that he has the equanimity the patience the calm the perspective
269.16,276.45, analysis the purring of a situation how he's able to look at a situation and how he's able to size things up in assess
276.63,294.24, but i mean obviously this little bit of eager human ultimately but this you know it's not about ego it's not about like prestige it's not about something silly it's not something about as fleeting and transitory is that it's about just kind of like putting everything out on the table having a grand survey of the situation and basically
294.24,328.98, laying things out of the sequential fashion so it's not to be overwhelmed by the different screwballs that life throws at you these are things that you do in order to increase your longevity and the vitamins that you take and the food that you eat and when you eat and the portions that you eat it now the thing that ages you the quickest is stuffing your belly with food and sitting on a couch or sitting on a chair into lake like meeting an exact or whatever the product ours know like meeting a some kind of a pill to likewise
329.13,337.92, all your digestive system these are very important things and as i get older i think about the very frequently and there on my mind pretty pretty persistently
339.48,343.23, i want to be around the really say that joke i want to be around so i'm plus
343.56,353.31, and it's very important to associate with people in your life either on the person or the intimate that are very aware of a similar type of a situation that don't you know throw
353.4,356.4, anthropois to oblivion
356.67,364.44, little things that crop up in my thoughts as i think about these various notions that remember things that were told to me by some very important people in my life
364.5,366.45, example my friend and at
366.48,368.25, breestraat
369.66,372.09, give me this great little sort of
372.3,374.88, you know like anybody who's a smoker
374.94,411.33, des drugs do eat duty key gone it doesn't matter if you're nice it doesn't matter if your fantastic i don't want to be with anybody who is a smoker and the reason that he incited which i cite as well as i don't want to have to look after you when you get sick as you're going to get sick as those sucking things that you smoke or pure poison their threeper death to so i'm not going to be there to take care of you when you abuse yourself and you can see some of the people that i know in my life that i knew when i was a university and that a persistent smokers and associate with him and the coughing and their spitting up this black green she and the cat ran in the candidates in the cantata so everything has a price
413.04,424.44, pretty much for the last half decade of my life it's about long japanese and wanting to be here for a very long time and also having a spiritual approach as well another one to get too much into religion where religiosity but having a spiritual approach
424.92,427.44, realizing that that's an energy as well
427.65,434.76, exists in the world that impinges very profoundly upon how you conduct your day to day
435.21,440.61, understanding that it's not just you like you know going about your space like a bull it's also about the things
440.76,442.92, balance that
442.98,444.57, of corporeal
444.81,447.66, existence protein foreign carbon form
447.72,450.0, me me the 
450.36,451.38, it were
453.72,454.56, so
455.22,457.74, these are the things just to repeat again longevity
458.16,459.75, eat and drink
460.2,462.12, you think about and what you read
462.33,464.28, people that you associate with
464.31,466.41, having a spiritual approach
466.83,470.94, and then watching older people and like literally being inspired by them
471.39,483.57, and it's such a compliment again just to conclude it's such a common when the older guys come up to you like he did to meet this morning at the gym and i just come up to you and they poisoner and they say you know i look at you
483.63,493.29, i'm very inspired i just sit here and that makes me want to come into the gym more often and to work harder because they see how you work out because i see how you approach
493.29,506.19, physical i see that you are dogged about wanting to be precise technically correct in or not just there like hofali some meat head like some juice pig now you want to come in and you want to do everything to the letter
506.52,522.42, then they give you a compliment and then they go off and it's just like i could receive no bigger compliment than from a mature individual man or woman who tells you that you during the right thing that's a huge compliment and it means to him on the right path and that's why i continue to do what i do
522.66,524.4, so back again for watching
524.49,531.6, a great weekend again i'm experimenting back with these video blogs again for those that have known me for many years i used to do these things pretty regularly
531.69,557.73, and i think i stopped in but i've been using to get back in front of the camera again and now i'm having an opportunity to do so and you know again just to make a quick statement i don't know if anybody was following i was debating whether to go with the tripod form sit down on my ass or whether all kind of like take different locations in the city and i walk around gunsmith my cell phone and just record and i thought that this latter technique would actually be more
557.79,564.63, time on account of the fact that i think better on my feet and i like to walk around plus i gives you a chance to see what's going on behind my back
564.72,574.8, when i'm doing these various things so thanks again for watching have a great week end i think i'll take the weekend off and i come back again on monday with another idea that i already cooking in my head
