58.5,62.04, she should be appreciated and respected right
65.46,68.88, aren't get any of that good stuff
69.36,72.27, less respect and appreciation
73.59,76.26, not because of his lack of faith or
77.4,80.88, disobedience call he was consistently
81.27,83.91, obedient and faithful to god
86.61,89.94, at germantown judah
90.3,92.67, away from worshipping idols
95.34,102.21, was given the job to deliver a very unpopular message very convicting message one that
102.72,105.66, in great mental pain
106.89,110.28, that calls him to be hated by his own people
113.04,117.45, gratefully preach that message for over years
117.45,120.93, without seeing anyone change their heart
121.8,123.21, follow 
123.21,125.73, not sure how he did that i'm not sure
126.0,127.44, that
130.44,134.46, the people didn't want to hear it any more they had hardened their heart
135.93,137.64, not going to change
139.53,142.68, somehow they needed to shut jeremy
144.9,147.63, after eighteen in verse
149.37,152.07, certain ones said come
152.43,155.19, make plans against
157.23,160.68, it can be a dangerous thing to speak the truth
160.98,163.59, people who don't want to hear the truth
164.82,169.08, speak the truth the people who came to handle the truth
171.69,173.46, standing tall
174.27,176.58, not the easiest thing to do
178.53,179.85, plot
180.15,183.18, conspiracy was being formed
183.3,184.89, silence
189.9,191.88, certain ones said
192.69,196.53, come let's make plans against jeremiah for instruction
196.62,202.11, never be lost from the priest nor counsel from the wise or word from the prophet come
202.23,204.3, then mount him
205.35,208.08, pay no attention to all his words
208.74,213.0, no talking about a simple disagreement here
213.9,217.83, people are out to destroy jeremiah whatever
221.46,227.58, plans include spread lies about him to get the people to turn against him
228.57,231.78, bring legal charges against him of
232.08,234.3, as for me and treason
235.62,238.44, and then finally to bring a plan
238.65,240.33, assassinate him
242.13,246.63, they were planning to use three groups of influential people
246.66,248.52, to make all of this happened
249.45,253.2, for instruction will never be lost from the priest
253.59,256.32, counsel from the wise or word
256.47,258.03, the prophet
258.69,261.75, to use the priests the wise
262.71,263.88, the profits
264.9,267.03, the priests represent
267.06,269.82, corrupt religious authority
270.12,272.58, or the intellectual and
272.97,276.03, advisers these profits were
276.27,278.52, false profits so that day
279.06,284.79, combine all of their influence and all of their power to bring down
285.54,288.18, one man of god jeremiah
288.96,291.6, thought they could keep him quiet
292.38,299.04, they could continue to do what they were doing and if they only knew just how wrong they were
300.21,304.26, about years into jeremiah's ministry
304.8,310.71, the years of rejection and mockery were beginning to take their toll on german
312.15,315.72, is a godly man but he still
315.93,317.22, just the man
318.78,321.51, to his prayer for those who
321.57,324.45, conspired against him and the verse 
325.53,330.48, roy heard from their houses when you suddenly bring readers against them
331.32,335.76, they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet
336.93,338.76, you lord
339.09,341.85, all their deadly plots against me
342.93,345.27, not wipe out their iniquity
346.62,353.01, not blot out their sin before you let them be forced to stumble before you still with them
353.25,355.5, in the time of your anger
357.6,361.32, we almost come to terms with germs prayer by
361.53,367.29, in that he's basically asking god to bring the judgment that god had pronounced on them
367.95,369.84, her disobedience
370.29,372.33, as praying
372.33,376.32, he had already warned with happened to them if they did not repent
378.81,382.89, but still we struggle with this kind of prayer in
383.61,385.11, rightly so
386.31,388.98, would it be right for us to pray that way
390.6,395.34, should we ever imitate this prayer of jeremiah
395.64,397.08, answers to
398.85,403.17, think we have a clue what he went through what he suffered what
403.5,407.28, and door yet he still remained faithful
408.06,409.68, scripture is
410.13,414.57, god hears the cries of those who suffer for his name
416.34,418.02, some 
421.2,423.09, i cry out
424.08,425.76, the lord here
426.87,429.75, and rescues them from all their troubles
431.31,435.54, but to pray that god would not wipe out their iniquity
438.18,442.59, the pray that god would not blot out their sins
443.34,444.78, that's not right
446.58,449.28, as also asterias
450.39,452.88, he is not our example
454.65,457.98, another profit who came after jeremy
459.72,462.57, he spoke the truth to the people
463.47,466.23, did not want to hear his truth either
467.43,470.76, spend its whole life helping and hilling and
470.91,474.99, loving the less fortunate yet he was also despised
476.25,477.48, priest
478.11,482.79, the wise and the false prophets conspired against him to
483.48,487.5, turn the people against him also by spreading lies
487.71,491.7, they accused him of treason and blasphemy also
491.88,495.39, also plotted to assassinate him
497.13,499.68, instead of praying to
500.04,502.2, not both out there since
503.73,508.47, instead of praying to not wipe out their antiquity he prayed
508.98,513.0, forgive them for they know not what they do
513.87,515.58, the example
516.3,517.86, we should follow
520.11,522.09, is what jesus taught
523.11,527.76, and this is what we should do matthew chapter first 
529.5,531.42, he heard that it was said
531.75,535.05, love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i tell you
536.01,538.59, love your enemies and pray for those
539.07,540.6, persecute you
542.82,545.22, the apostle paul continues
545.64,548.85, teaching and romans chapter 
550.59,552.96, bless those who persecute you
553.68,555.9, and do not curse
557.52,560.46, i did not have endorses instead
560.79,565.38, leave room for god's wrath because it is written vengeance belongs to me
565.56,568.26, i will repay as the lord
569.73,572.49, your enemy is hungry feed him
574.08,576.63, a thirsty given something to drink
578.1,582.6, so doing you will be heaping fire coals on his head
584.49,588.03, not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good
588.57,590.28, as christ followers
590.67,591.96, christians
593.22,595.68, how we are taught to respond
597.33,599.76, not always easy as it
601.5,605.94, we don't always respond that way and traffic to 
607.95,611.22, don't always respond that way on a social media
613.71,618.06, sorry to say your pastor does not always respond that way either
621.48,624.18, god help us to be humble
625.26,627.84, obedient as christ
631.92,635.04, god told jeremiah to return
635.31,638.13, the potter house remember the potter house
639.21,640.65, this time
641.43,644.19, spectator but as a customer
646.02,649.77, in to take some of the jewish elders in some of the
650.01,652.35, leaders with him to the potter house
654.21,658.62, this was a demonstration of his faith in god because jeremy knew
658.95,662.28, about the plots and the conspiracies against him
667.14,669.0, what the lord says
670.05,672.27, by a potter's clay jar
673.26,681.69, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the leading priest and go out to bennivale
681.84,684.06, the entrance of the port or gate
684.99,686.97, claimed there the words
687.15,689.64, speak to you say
689.88,693.78, the word of the lord king of judah residence of jerusalem
694.62,698.25, what the lord of armies the god of israel says
700.02,705.75, i am going to bring such disaster on this place that every one who hears about it will shudder
706.35,710.4, cause they have abandoned me and made this a foreign place
711.24,714.54, burned incense unto other gods
716.67,721.02, then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people going with you
722.28,724.47, you are to proclaim to them
725.34,728.28, what the lord of armies says
729.06,732.39, shatter these people and this city
732.84,735.72, one shatters a potter's jar
735.99,740.25, never again be mended
741.87,744.99, i take the jewish leaders
745.59,748.35, this valley near the other gate
749.7,752.67, this is where the potters were
753.48,759.69, this is where the broken pottery was thrown away this is jerusalems garbage dump
762.12,768.24, with great courage german deliver god's message to the leaders
768.87,773.82, when he finishes his message with a very powerful object lesson
774.03,776.91, he smashes the clay pot
777.42,782.37, many pieces demonstrating what god is going to do to the city
782.76,784.08, the people
784.74,789.9, also their constant disobedience and idol worship
792.15,795.21, last week we talked about how the potter
795.75,801.36, take some messed up play and remould it into something useful
803.55,808.35, that is possible as long as the clay is soft
810.24,813.84, possible as long as our heart
814.59,816.0, soft
817.02,819.45, when the clay becomes hard
820.98,824.28, our heart becomes hard
825.87,828.09, cannot be removed
829.98,834.69, the people of judah their heart had become hard
836.34,839.85, they had rejected god too many times
840.6,843.3, too long and for them
843.99,845.37, too late
847.14,851.58, i don't say this to scare anyone or to guilt
851.67,852.78, anyone
854.88,858.93, the opportunity to make things right with god
859.56,864.12, will not always be available to you
866.76,869.01, now is
869.07,870.96, the right time
873.45,877.47, now is the right time for you to become a christian
879.42,881.85, now is the right time
882.09,884.85, you to make things right with god
887.55,891.39, now is the right time for you to be bad times
893.85,896.85, now is the right time for you
897.12,898.47, come back
901.53,904.23, none of us are guaranteed
906.9,909.57, none of us are guaranteed
909.84,912.03, another time
914.85,916.8, before you leave
919.35,920.49, right
924.3,926.04, standing tall
926.67,928.35, with a price
930.48,935.46, i faithfully delivered josmian it cost him
937.47,939.81, after verse
942.33,944.28, the priest
944.4,945.72, no i
946.59,951.99, chief official and the temple of the lord heard jeremiah prophesy in these things
953.61,957.42, pastor had the profit jeremiah beaten
958.74,963.09, put him in stocks at the upper benjamin gate in the lord's temple
964.2,968.37, story that started in the potter's house ended up
968.58,970.29, with a beating
971.25,974.1, lot in prison stocks
975.63,978.3, only did germaine
978.6,982.14, physical suffering for being faithful
982.47,984.27, obedient to god
985.35,989.58, the stress brought emotional trauma as well
991.59,996.12, who is the blame for all of this mess and just like we do sometimes
997.14,999.9, bland
1003.17,1005.36, seemed to me lord
1006.35,1008.15, i was to see
1009.68,1012.14, seize me and prevailed
1012.56,1017.6, i am a laughing stock all the time every one ridicules me
1018.74,1024.08, whenever i speak i cry out i proclaim violence and destruction
1024.44,1028.88, the word of the lord has become my constant disgrace
1028.94,1030.8, and the origin
1031.82,1034.67, saying that god tricked him into the ministry
1035.18,1038.24, and once he got em in he overpowered him
1038.66,1041.81, it's like arm wrestling with god
1042.17,1044.75, when you do that who do you think in a win
1047.87,1052.34, quickly realizes that god did not trick him
1054.62,1056.99, comes back to god
1058.79,1062.06, he realizes that god is so awesome
1062.48,1065.72, he has no choice but to tell every one about him
1066.29,1067.55, so
1068.54,1069.95, say
1070.7,1074.57, i won't mention him or speak any longer in his name
1074.96,1078.56, his message becomes a fire burning in my heart
1079.07,1081.23, shut up in my bones
1081.5,1084.11, tired of holding it in
1084.47,1085.88, i cannot
1088.19,1091.25, then listen to germinie as
1092.0,1094.76, he begins to grow in his faith in god
1097.64,1100.55, the lord is with me like a violent warrior
1101.96,1105.8, therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail
1106.85,1111.89, they have not succeeded they will be utterly shamed as everlasting humiliation
1112.04,1113.99, never be forgotten
1114.32,1117.56, they listen to the song of praise and first 
1118.07,1119.81, song that he sings
1121.34,1122.96, sing to the lord
1123.53,1127.01, as the lord for he rescues the life of the needy
1127.28,1128.87, evil people
1130.1,1134.66, then listen to the contrast between verse 
1135.17,1137.69, verse for its astounding
1138.32,1141.26, the god wants us to hear the pain
1141.71,1143.69, my voice
1144.83,1147.98, i believe this is in the bible to confirm that
1148.04,1152.78, there are both high and low as we follow god
1153.29,1156.77, that living for god is not always on the mountain top
1158.27,1160.97, there will be days in the valley also
1164.54,1167.12, the day that i was born because
1168.23,1171.77, the day my mother bore me never be blessed
1173.72,1177.08, i really mean that i don't think so
1178.43,1182.15, he's not saying why that i have to be born at all
1183.08,1187.43, i think he is questioning why do i have to deal with all this mess
1188.99,1190.82, and so the question
1192.14,1194.48, you know christians get the press to
1195.5,1196.94, even preachers
1198.5,1200.9, things calls the pression
1202.04,1205.58, still learning more about that and what calls he said
1206.45,1209.45, it's called by mental illness
1210.29,1213.17, medication is required to help
1214.01,1216.02, that's okay
1217.55,1219.71, president can be very serious
1220.55,1224.12, and professional christian counseling
1224.78,1227.27, it's important to get professional help
1229.49,1232.07, there are some steps that you can take
1232.34,1234.05, also help
1234.26,1235.67, depression
1236.06,1238.22, those is to connect
1238.91,1240.53, the christians
1241.46,1244.19, chapter ten or 
1245.33,1250.1, let us watch out for one another to provoke love and good works
1250.97,1257.99, neglecting together together as summer in the habit of doing but encouraging each other
1259.01,1260.72, we're depressed
1261.62,1266.45, be tempted to want to be left alone and that's the worst thing that
1266.9,1268.19, do
1269.3,1273.08, we need to say connected with other christians even
1273.23,1274.79, you don't feel like it
1275.15,1277.25, on sunday
1278.24,1279.89, connected
1280.22,1282.14, the part of a life group
1283.58,1289.13, time to meet with other christians during the week if it's only just to go out and get coffee
1291.08,1294.89, you need that encouragement and that support now
1295.19,1297.02, than ever
1297.23,1299.0, and that other christians
1299.21,1302.54, and then take care of yourself physically
1303.47,1306.77, last thing you want to do and you're depressed as to work out
1307.4,1311.87, research is proven that regular exercise helps fight
1312.41,1313.49, depression
1313.82,1315.68, your body releases
1315.83,1319.25, that help you fill better when you exercise
1320.03,1324.95, hard to get started but doing just a little bit what help you gain the energy
1325.43,1326.75, more
1328.67,1333.11, you're depressed you'll be tempted to self medicaid with food
1334.46,1339.05, long with exercise you need to clean up your diet and try to eat healthy
1340.01,1341.78, fast food
1341.84,1344.33, food sugar
1345.23,1349.7, more natural foods fruits vegetables you'll fill the difference
1351.47,1356.69, getting enough rest is another important element of taking care of yourself physically
1357.98,1361.49, difficult but make an effort to get a good night's sleep
1361.97,1363.71, reduce your stress
1365.0,1366.92, other christians
1367.94,1369.95, care of yourself physically

1392.12,1393.74, cries
1394.82,1396.83, might be depressed
1396.95,1400.31, but it doesn't mean you aren't blessed
