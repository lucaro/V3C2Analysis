6.6,10.89, i have adopted the attitude of being like an ant
11.1,12.33, a leaf
12.45,14.1, the stream of life
14.64,18.42, the days i lived by very simple rules
19.35,21.21, what i know about me
21.21,22.98, what i know about you
23.76,26.4, i am not the person you think i am
27.0,33.54, i am the product of your creation based on your education experiences and expectations
33.87,37.35, i am as you imagine to be
37.83,46.02, you confirm your vision of me by constant validation by others who believe as you do and there is nothing i can do about that
46.38,55.29, about it because constantly changing hopefully for the better your fixed division of me seem not to apply any more
55.86,65.19, because of this reality i try my best to be true to myself to adopt attitudes i ll help me to be a better person and i do my utmost best to her no one
65.19,67.2, to please you might you
67.2,70.47, to change your mind about me i can't do that
70.47,73.23, but because it is emportant to me
73.59,88.44, understand clearly that i'm not perfect that i have just by being alive and by making errors in life and living that i have hurt others and to those that i have heard i apologized for my errors and my short comings
90.39,99.6, that and on that length i cannot walk on water so i refrain from judging others until such time that i can walk on water
100.08,104.88, in the meantime i will say here i contemplate my own mortality
105.3,107.34, i will forgive every one
107.34,110.61, i offer my thanks and praise
110.94,116.73, i will do my best to erase greed and be a negative thoughts and attitudes for my life
116.88,124.05, i will be satisfied with all this abundance around me and be very happy in all that i have
124.98,126.18, as for you
126.3,130.89, no i have met her expectations i wish you sincerely
131.19,132.21, so
132.21,134.64, happiness always
