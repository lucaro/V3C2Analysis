0.0,33.06, a recently came across a collection of old home movies in an obscure corner of the internet trousers in the collection comprising a digital museum of other people's memories the depict mostly family scenes in domestic bereft middle decades of the twentieth century providing a rare and candid glimpse of everyday life in a different time they mostly show moments of togetherness families together and living rooms on front lawn on sidewalks and metamar and the family car
33.06,268.53, some show their age like this one family gathered around the t v set watching the moon landings others are more timeless their age only betrayed by the dust and scratches dancing over the frame of all the home moves in the collection one stands out to me in particular it's a fifteen minute travelogue documenting one families road trip or in america in nineteen fifty seven a title cardite beginning dubs the film saw of the happy wanderers phrase painted on the family's camper there isn't much information about the footage or the family depicts the film was silent which leaves the context a question mark in the characters mostly anonymous a little girl and her mother appeared most often here they stand by their camport beginning of the trip the girl waved at the camera she does that a lot the gottlober dam in the grand canyon the watch native americans perform a dance for a crowd they stop at white sands national monument in new mexico at the girl runs and plays in the hills of sand a boys there too he jumps on the top of the sand dune and the girl follows they make many stops along the way the good was no somewhere and look at the animals his stand on the banks of the mississippi river here the art together in some one's backyard in the sunny afternoon title card tells us her name's connie metatarse enth birthday party she blows out the candles and the only cake i wonder where connais now more she's been in all the time since she ballgown up to day and early sixties wonder she remembers any of these moments are memories of mostly slipped away eroded by time deteriorated and forgotten like an old araim even though these aren't my memories i still feel nostalgic when i see them it's vicarious nostalgia that's even possible i wasn't there i was even alive and my head there is this big concept of before a time when everything seemed simpler than to day old hummer perfect simple for such times it's weird business for other people's memories but there's a universality to these home moves as if the warm tones of old granny footage composed the language of longing in memory harking back to a past i don't remember and didn't experience but still feel drawn to these home movies along with other cultural artifacts like vinaros or the potent combination of mean and sent represent collective memories shared ideas of the past beyond our personal experiences another time another place before this of course ignores all the negative aspects of the past favoring instead a romanticized dream granting bygone and manufactured appeal it's a cynical sentiment that the future can only be worse and at the best is always behind us receding away as we speed into the abyss of the future the past has a potential energy to it the idea of existing in prenatal times before everything that's happened since past futures in retrospect seem bright and sunny and attractive when compared with to day but the grand shame is that we can only see this by looking back it's invisible when right in front of us the seventeenth century asagehon sickness first diagnosed in whispers in aries fighting in france a long for the familiar mountain homeland in sending them back was the only effective cure since then nostalgia has evolved from a longing for place to a longing for time somewhere we can't go
268.56,285.99, no cure for nostalgia as it exists to day there's only a treatment escape is reveling in all that we have of the past the trinkets and souvenirs holmes television shows in the shared experience of drawing up in the nice atmospheres of our respective childhood decades
286.83,293.58, surrounded ourselves with the past as a cushion of sorts incubating us in a room that shields from the harshness of reality
294.18,324.42, a result time doesn't go away any more and said it's just put on the shelf where persists in syndication a perpetual ambulance to modern life a coping that an ism in the face of rapid change cultural nostalgia as we may call it isn't new but are current relationship to it is the internet as provided unhindered access to an exhaustive archive of cultural memory eliminating the scarcity of the past in a predigt age and replacing it with sheer abundance
324.72,343.59, so the first truly digital decade in the first decade that saw widespread use of the public international it is now on the internet so longside the spike an innovation in global the nats are also characterized by intoxication with what came before some mutinously shoving us into the future and tugging us back into the past
343.65,354.63, bad organ because nostalgia isn't necessarily or strictly derivative it can also be productive and creative evident through some recent original series with message undertones
356.01,361.17, still this begs the question and consideration of our own time will be defined and remembered
361.32,372.18, the chief power of the internet has given rise to a movement of temporal and cultural preservation now that we have the power to capture time and a bottle and re examine it whenever we like we don't really have to let it go
372.45,379.08, it'll be interesting to see how the first digital generations relate to nostalgia and the past given its abundance in today's culture
379.98,405.66, with the modern world changing so fast we find ourselves hurtling into the uncertainty of the future and an ever accelerating rate were thrust into a to morrow we were unwilling immigrants from yesterday pining for the comfort and familiarity of a homeland we can never revisit the stadia and moderation may be a healthy indulgence the comforting lie we tell ourselves and willingly buy into in order to adapt to an increasingly global ized ever changing world
405.81,407.94, an inevitable product of our time
408.18,419.55, we grow the shallow childhood innocence must face the harshness of the world and times of despair uncertainty when overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness the sage provides the valuable escape

439.65,466.86, it doesn't good or bad it can heal and call upon the heel and it can deceive when too much trust is placed in its warm embrace many of us feel that if we could relive the memory dear to us you would cherish it more if we could transport ourselves back and live it again we relish its warmth and its brevity we breathe it in before it yet again disappears as time always does that much warning with how much care
467.7,486.21, the funny thing is nostalgia requires separation a distance in time and an acceptance that what's gone is un retrievable otherwise the spell doesn't work all we can do is examiner memories the souvenir a song behoove a comforting glimpse of the way we were through a window
486.21,508.44, distant with a longing that can never be cured and remind ourselves that were infinite product of where we've been that memories are real even if they no longer exist they happened and disappeared he kept something from them some token of the passage through time only in that way can be re visit what can't be retrieved before the taper uns out
