0.0,11.79, i sang that song for more than sixty years a song of praise to joseph smith
11.85,29.19, profit of the restoration and founder of the old church the church i served as a bishop for five years i knew the church was true i was a faithful latterday saying my life as men will on certain truths
29.28,31.62, wishing doesn't change the truth
32.49,76.14, i said you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free when i finally learned the truth about the real history and doctrines mormonism i realized that i was following the gospel joseph smith and not the gospel of jesus christ i have come to learn that many others have made a similar journey out of the bondage of religion and into an authentic relationship with jesus and that's what they show is all about courageous people who want to show their story hoping that you the viewer will discover the same new life in jesus so if you're a later day save whistling with questions or seeking a genuine encounter with the safety of join us to night
76.26,103.92, a joyful message that we want to share with you welcome to another episode of the ex woman files on your hospital and i appreciate your spending some time with us i have a guest and to day who story is somewhat similar to mine and it's very fascinating i think you'll enjoy it it jason un
104.1,114.81, and appreciate your coming and i'm sure they'll say your name on the screen but it's an unusual measter of thee i'm told that germany
114.81,116.88, means
117.27,136.5, quiet or uneasy and behave people remember me as a rule so as loosens lower in the fine out that you made some changes in your life horserace california that's where you grew up yet i i live there
136.5,145.23, until i went and served to mission in barway and no you were last originally the number family what were they in
146.04,173.01, kind of kind of merely didn't have any particular no really up he religion wasn't something we did as a family there was a bit of pressure from my paternal grandmother too to perform that in some way but there was a tin of shack from us on a madagascar and he just kind of let us
173.16,200.67, our own path and here so some point you run into some ibis friends and the kind of disgust to the church with you yes about that while these are my aves remy best bloedsinnig school i kind of ran in a couple o different crowds one that was the very party heavy and the other of these other guys and mormondom bodies were a surprise i was and now they had a lot of fun and didn't go
200.73,205.5, reasons
205.62,222.48, my leading in the mormonism really was out in northern california waiting for a wave to come in to mention has gossamerland is actually it was widowhood no background in anything and so everything there were saying just
222.48,310.29, was wild and iceland you know these were my these were my terms he's my really good body probably four or five and then that group grew the where i was just solely hanging out with him and then suddenly in these missionaries talkativeness thereby
310.71,326.34, you know the mission in paraguay it was just it was fun it was great it was you know you know serving people and it just all pushed the button that i wanted to push it was just a fantasia
326.58,330.78, quasi public when i'm a mission but said he you know
331.02,342.21, the dog remember the mission at a emission was fantastic as i didn't we have fun is in yes we did but that was the question asked me didn't we have fun undine
342.54,376.14, he's a guy you know i love and respect him but that was just a weird question to ask now given what i had devolved you know and i'm probably at doing this always be and i have done it a number of times and leading question to me a few years later looking back on misstatements
376.14,401.4, really pushing the book a more families are for ever planeshear and joyously it was the organization is no no i mean when i mean he was spoken of and i get where that kind of gets in some folks way won't you know we talk of jesus is in the name of our church and i get that 
401.97,409.5, but this is a religious thing we're doing and it's near lining up all these half teosinte
409.56,465.54, form for the church really i mean you look at the hops you got to jump through to go to the temple large to be go to heaven and that's all distant er interesting thing that happens why you're on your mission is a yamassee converted to the church it youkahainen something happened as you came home it happened oh well by the time i got out they were inactive that was so far as soon doubt because again they had become part of my eternal family and now as what they got and of course the threshold didn't do something right or i didn't do something right or i might test the money wasn't strong enough and a bobouton and never really
466.17,476.55, spent time to ask why and just going to quietly was now you ended up getting married in the temple awful temple and good lasgird martensson
476.58,495.33, he did she asked to return and so you're married now for many years years and then a very patient for children but infortune well what happens so long away her
495.36,520.98, active i mean you have callings over corn osborne teacher ah well here's a thing i or life was designed around this we had purposely innocence this was worth the truth was in capitulated the we were i'm all and she's all in we resort kids on purpose all in and it just was where truth was and so i can't
521.16,544.02, looking back it's like i couldn't imagine anything was wrong there but brown two thousand men and guests here two thousand six or seven maybe sooner i would go to church and those things that i had spoken of before that were true like a no duchesses of refino the church is true i know whatever profit is the profit he ends
544.02,558.0, were things i knew and i felt that my eye you know there was a motion behind that and so suddenly i'm sinecure and somebody else is saying those things i get this big ball could his cuninghame
558.84,564.54, no joseph misimprove it was like good no
564.63,581.43, yeah we do with it i know so i'm so hearing thinking well i'm looking around going is it this is a joke i mean what can it was it was not that it was audible it wasn't but it was this profound moment of wisdom
581.58,588.66, and it was you had other concerns about nature ever ever ever help
588.84,605.4, with my belief it was you know i knew about the old temper temple ceremony and i explained the way okay great so they change it that's cool black the priesthood they know no big deal there was an it was if they said you know we just
605.4,628.32, we supposed to know the right now oh i tempted the transliteration six to ten seven till eight i mean it just kept happening i go to church is the true church and i am just starting to stack these things up that
628.74,632.25, should be true from me that are not true
632.25,643.59, and i know it i can't explain it away i'm starting to talk to my wife about it i am agonizing i am freaking out because if this isn't true
644.01,647.01, then i don't know what is and
647.25,653.07, well this is my eternal fame not you know a hellion what's going on as you 
653.22,654.48, my wife's also
654.48,662.73, a wife is leaps and bounds cooler and better than me and when this was going on i am terrified and i am like
663.21,666.18, i think it were done
666.39,674.61, i'm losing my family nainsell wells up the stuff and so i remember
674.88,700.71, just kind of bein a real big jerk to her about it and i was going to head it off at the pass and i really tried to push her way i really tried to your outcomer like like i was goin to drop her before she dropped me because i know the church says that you know you just you kick the gatineaus rock and the polished have been thrown so
700.95,716.88, but she kept coming back with love and your my guy and i choose you and i alike let us sweeties that kept happening and i finally decide around somewhere into those
717.24,722.13, i can't go and i can't take it i can't pretend
722.31,724.05, and
724.14,731.55, member i had borne my testimony few months before i left and i couldn't say
733.35,749.91, i knew anything about the church was true and i even said that i can't say this but your testimony i don't know that i did because i remember the bishop who was my body came up and he sethosis awesome as what i said was
750.09,751.38, i don't know
752.22,768.99, but i do believe in jesus and i just can't get past that and it was precieuse jesus was there jesus was supposedly this was his churches it just wasn't working and so i finally
769.2,782.01, round and like i can't do it one we shall leave and she stood by me the entire time and she kept going and i found myself 
782.37,784.71, trying to find work on sunday is
784.92,799.11, i excuse i did and then fell at some point the bishop called you in here oh yeah they wanted to renumbered that amos that was actually before he left and
799.17,804.78, in one of my buddies with the first counter and i go and you know i don't want that
804.99,813.06, americano i got the canyon was just
813.72,831.21, i don't want it i don't believe in it and i don't know why i don't believe in it i just know i don't believe in it and you really didn't at this point you really didn't know all the negative stuff and knew none of us will doctrine history or anything either knew none of it or the stuff that i did know
831.24,843.72, nineteen like okay we'll put that in a compartment for later cause you know i don't need to know me to deal with it is it was all pretty clean i mean i left the church with
844.92,886.74, wasn't i wasn't angry at it in fact for convenience sake i agonize i wished i could still be mormon so that it would be easy on my kids would be easy on my wife's be easy one and it thus it couldn't happen i couldn't will it to happen to it some point you go into your office years'll this this happened my wife i started becoming one of my good two things is when i'm scared i get angry and she's like your beginning way to angry and need to find god she is like a care for your mormon christian you could be you dissolve catholic i don't care you're driving me crazy
887.07,902.88, go find god and so my freight i am going to be buddhist because that's cool i am just going to do that and some reading buddhism like gray and at one point she who go with your buddy to that church a goes to which was cato
903.39,919.41, i care okay i'll go to the christian church whatever and that's going to be a free show because i hear they got a band and you know it's going to be totally ever into and i go there and there's this gallon a guitar and acoustic and she's just
919.83,946.77, praising jesus in song and i just lose it just lose it like were praying to god through song i'm praying to got thorson wait a minute i've just been trying to tell myself an atheist and now i'm praying the what in justice to go back the next week and you know distances again so i go home that after that second week and i kneel down
947.07,948.48, look at
950.79,964.11, believe in you i do i get it i'm crying constantly now and i'm feeling you but don't get this don't get the jesus i don't get the everything out of it together to do get it so you
964.14,968.94, you're going to have to help me like i can't do this i am
968.94,976.17, terrified and happy and i don't get it and i just need you so it was this answer of
977.22,990.9, something like in my head it was just like i've got you i love you right where you are i know you're a mass i know your angry and now your scared i know you're just trying to blow everything up so it goes away
990.93,997.17, and i gave my love to grace right there as i knelt in my office floor and i go out into
998.7,1000.05, room
1001.04,1014.99, and it was kind of like this awesome and know raiment like a kind know what this means you know i go out i had something like a lease
1016.94,1024.44, christian it turns out and she she's crying and so that started this journey of
1024.56,1026.27, just
1027.14,1032.99, for lack of a better word i guess letting jesus wants is stiff arm and macray
1033.68,1035.12, in realizing that
1035.33,1040.25, he's got me an he wasn't worried
1041.66,1049.34, it was nothing doctrinal for me it was just relational it was this pure i love you
1049.76,1050.84, moment
1050.9,1062.21, i just wanted to be with him i wanted to dig into the word i would want it to go to church i wanted to just be with him transferred
1062.3,1065.45, to feel that is a good word actually
1065.6,1083.57, you understood grace is a mormon no i mean the word there was said often enough but this this idea that this thing i don't deserve i'm getting because jesus loves me like i don't
1083.72,1089.75, i know i deserve it at last and everybody and you know i know how missed up my mind
1089.78,1093.83, you really even understand that sacrifice on the cross
1094.04,1101.12, no i know i didn't know i didn't get it it was it was it was kind of a
1101.63,1113.39, it was like it was like the story that i was supposed to relate to this story of a supposed to understand deeply and i didn't get it until i can get it in the office of
1113.51,1116.81, again it was information on this hand or
1117.17,1120.11, in relationship with the god of the universe here and it
1121.13,1149.57, whelming the bible as he will change for you yahmani i carried it around as a missioner she was hardened down my bag but you know it was a book mormon we were slain and sure but tremendously i mean i look back and go how could i have looked at his words as these imperfect things are these things that needed to be revised and edited by
1152.48,1158.84, and i remember my bible study or scripture study which included a book more manoel's what else but
1159.77,1174.02, it was a chore i didn't want it to be a carpeted always was a charity to carve out time to read the scriptures that you know and for for some reason at some point
1175.43,1178.67, at this moment in the office it was
1179.12,1183.29, like the esoon jesus in there and
1183.41,1190.73, i need and as yet was like a god the analogy of food before i heard it and was so dumb to me
1191.18,1204.08, in this moment i like i get that analogy now because this is i want this moment i want this time with jesus i want to hear what he says i want to be with him and
1204.44,1222.77, that was totally different and what i experienced before to you wife has been supported through all the stiletto her serawoolli to hear her story some time if she had cared to share that or she's amazing and we did the two church thing for
1223.1,1239.96, a year or two ago with her to do and now i wouldn't tease would she would take the kid to the mormon church and then once a month and then it became twice a month in an imbecile three times a month they would come with you and yet because she wanted to do church with me
1240.02,1254.69, chiefly of the service as any beata as christian era will yet the christian service is contestor as it were in action really enjoyed it and she dissipating and she did 
1254.72,1266.36, culturally though she was still really it and so you know i left the mormon church pretty clean but a year a year and a half and my christianity though it became
1266.69,1280.64, men wanting to kind of beat her out of mormonism with the word you know we give back guy that christian and you know her heels just dug in and we had fits and she
1280.73,1285.08, the one showing the grace she was the one that kept coming out and to say
1285.56,1300.92, you know i love you and i am like a perceiving this gift and still this and become this guy now hear those stories and now was i got er yeah unruly yet so so
1302.24,1308.6, a church mission this is for jesus not for you and this is not this is not your deal
1308.81,1314.39, even on your shoulder this is our general
1314.6,1332.18, i felt god saying that to me too and i finally it's funny that i gave my life to him but there are still thistle compartment with them and i take that i make that i think monkee that and my wife my son that struggling men to keep those because i'm a better part than you got apparently that's what i thought so my wife
1332.27,1334.1, i just
1334.1,1336.38, this moment with jesus and the like
1337.04,1338.75, i don't
1339.11,1342.5, sure you love her more than me
1342.98,1358.97, yours and whatever this journey looks like or i'm out of trying to force it to be a certain way and she is yours and then this movement started happened with her that was not what i would have designed
1359.45,1364.49, it was super perfect and then there was the moment where
1364.94,1366.89, we had had an argument again
1367.07,1386.54, and she goes out has his wrestle with god she's taken this i am not called this tool that cuts weeds and she was cut nourish it and she's like god you know this is not going to go well and i'm going to go and i'm going to go to the creation church all the time and i'm just going to go all in here and
1386.87,1391.61, there is other things that happened in this conversation but when she called me she says
1391.7,1393.2, the government of
1394.01,1400.28, in what a trio talk or out of it like we don't do that for me like no no
1401.15,1403.46, i were got has me i'm
1405.02,1426.26, i am here and it's been awesome journey like that overset and we have been you know doing this crazy walk this messy at bassora awesome wait is a challenge and and christianity can be gentleness so delightful so joyful a when
1426.35,1434.57, when i surrender and realized that the guy again the godliness has me now and why do i keep trying to take a back
1434.99,1442.94, so it's been awesome and my wife and i've been married years despite my best efforts when i left the church to push her 
1443.21,1459.8, and you know we walk together in christ houseman sister and their great now the voice been supported and when they left another but
1460.04,1477.08, he leaned more into christianity pretty rattle at the especially my sister and so memere talking to her husband and he had always have a bit of a roll about mormonism and i would defend it stanchly and read this conversation because he
1478.22,1490.37, reintegrate thing was that we i mean i thought it was i guess some basic questions what do you think the demos misunderstand about
1490.55,1495.86, a grace obviously
1498.32,1505.88, we get into a lot of the doctrines of rogues in his nature but the idea that there is this gift out there
1506.18,1523.4, and when i read five it seems pretty obvious it does to the needn't cover those scriptures as a missionary of the the ones that were hot the asseveration and orontas more the deduce
1525.71,1529.22, but the idea that there is a god who who
1529.94,1532.25, came and died and
1532.28,1535.04, me loves you and
1537.08,1538.61, he wants to
1538.85,1545.6, he wants us to walk with him he wants us to accept what he's done and there's this thing called
1546.02,1564.35, a sommation and that it is a misdirection ship that i have with god and not this thing where i got a man you know i had to make sure i don't drink that or do this or say that and i can make sure i go do this teaching and go to the temple and work work work work
1565.91,1583.1, disagreement all the burden be my oiseau my burden is life your family then is your church together when a mean
1583.28,1603.05, we do and that's been it's been a little hard because it we lost a little bit of currency with our kids because it was here's the truth and now and there were little older to some of the men as sixteen year old daughter an eighteen year old timers in college six year old attaree year old daughter to year old daughter and
1603.65,1617.33, they are now in a spot where their comfortable the last six eight months you know going to christian church and identifies christians for they identify as annoyed at eugenio like in a wood
1617.75,1662.03, ascertaining thing is that you were saying that it really was over doctrinal or even part of the history of the church i guess you learn more about that now in a kind of bugs me now things that you didn't know right history and i would use that that's the hammer obediently
1663.11,1665.72, what i've been saying is that
1666.23,1708.26, there is a god his name is jesus and he loves and loses and the case in thanks so much with a wonderful story i appreciate your time thanks and we'll see you next time on the exorable
