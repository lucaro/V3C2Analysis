0.18,34.74, good morning my name is more pain the physician who lives on may i am the district health officer from alicante for the state department of health so the department of health my office and the malecon civil defense we partner together and with decided that we would like to present to alicante only video series on updates where we stand
34.83,65.85, with certainties as mosquitoes that are affecting the rest of the world and coming into may so these mosquitoes are dangan chicken guayana chicken gone chick for short okay so where do we stand now and a little bit basic background since this is the first time in presenting to you we are having about several imported suspected cases of these three diseases per month
66.09,76.92, before this last year we were looking at maybe several imported cases coming outside from several cases per year
76.92,98.76, now we're having several months and it's all mixed up some chick some second some dingy carinated means that people either residence go somewhere where they get the disease a mexico or philippines and they bring it back and so all of our stuff that we've been looking at but sweedlepipe
98.88,104.46, sometimes visitors like bringing it okay so then they get here and we have to investigate
104.64,106.29, now
106.38,129.84, there is no local transmission that means these people have brought the stuff back they might have spread it to our mosquitoes and the mosquitoes might give it to a local residence we haven't seen the second half yet we haven't seen our local residence so all the people cases we look at or suspect they have travel history and that we will pick them up catherick
129.84,141.69, so we're looking at imported cases no outbreak not of course in florida they import so many that they have an outbreak but that's not as yet okay now
141.75,149.61, where are these things coming in i can tell when you get several a month there are current all over my
149.73,172.89, it's not one particular spot in fact we had one one et cetera et cetera a lot of times its suspected cases travel history symptoms they turn out when we check him by the laboratory not to be the disease are all there not confirmed while why don't we just do the laboratory first because the laboratory takes time
173.19,241.92, to actually confirm some of these most of these tests are sent upon a sometimes they got to be sent farther to the sad on the mainland sometimes are timing is wrong you drew the test too early so different tests become positive at different times none the less based on just the symptoms that travel history we will start to look at these places and two thirds of the time which i parforce does turn out to be negative and then we think while you did all that work for nothing not quite when we go out even if it's negative and even if we're extractions it makes the communes very aware that were under the threat or the castrate world is having these issues and it's kind of a general message but we focus it where the case was so what we do we go out to these homes and right now when looking at a couple in fact to day couple imported suspected cases in onawandah the past over leadenhall one cetacea and we tell people
242.01,283.47, help them control the mosquitoes don't get bit him long parents long the shirt use repellent used mosquito coils fix the screens on their house don't get bitten next go around your house and destroy the breeding sights those water pockets that have the lavinian empty it out say you have bromelias spray it once a week with the soapy water solution just use dish washed so it's on our website what's that delusion so that's what we tell people that we focusing on the areas that we have suspected imported cases what out do we tell the people well
283.59,285.78, a case has come in
286.14,295.71, tanaquites bid him that aristides have these diseases and they might transmit it to our residence we never travel so we have to go
295.77,299.04, for all the residents around this area
299.25,306.42, by that i mean yards in a day pierre they live where they were and where they had lunch
306.51,308.37, to look for symptoms
308.43,318.18, and if they have symptoms of these diseases headache fever bodying join sometimes a rash scais red eyes
318.33,320.49, you noticed i didn't say cough
320.58,326.1, vomiting for diary so we're looking for kind of febrile
326.61,350.28, general body a can general may be a rash if they have these that means they might have got it from the mosquitoes that bit the imported cases then they should call their doctor and hellenes we were very closely with the doctors and they will notify us to watch for secondary cases
350.34,355.26, you have secondary cases that means you have an outbreak calford or
355.59,359.4, many other countries the rest of the world so
359.91,367.47, we can't go so many places all the time so often now so the reporting of
367.95,370.71, secondary cases or the suspicion
370.8,383.04, we are going with this public service announcement because we can visit all the homes all the time the lot of you aren't home when we go visit and then we live flowers on your door so if you have the symptoms
383.28,397.62, an if you don't travel please tell your doctor what's going on i call that and he'll call us or call the department of health and we will talk about this now where are these cases
397.62,402.27, you go to this website it's one word more ready
402.51,406.53, one way to slash mosquito
406.59,418.11, you could go to see oh i think that sounds county to each eye do you as we decided to vaguely kind of map
418.23,419.4, where these
419.46,421.62, imported case of our coming
422.22,449.55, the more we have people might just throw in the towel and say look everybody i may everywhere all the time patrols mosquitoes watch for secondary cases while we try to be a little more foolish go onto the website you can see where we are looking now if an important case comes and he doesn't spread it to the other neighbours and we watch and we don't see anything for maybe
449.64,456.36, too much while it burned out it's not going to go anywhere so then we try to track and
457.62,459.45, kind of active
459.75,476.91, suspected important cases if it comes back to his lab negative then okay let it go it looks like we i don't say we overreach it i think this is quite precautionary if you go out and only find positive collabone cases to don't think you're doing enough
477.03,498.18, being precautious enough so that's the situation i will try to give you our sort of the county people will come in and we'll give you a monthly updates on what's going on
498.39,514.77, i eenamost
