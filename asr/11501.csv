0.06,12.87, he was following some leases shall a tiger and a part security firm has been working with public authority officials to sort of police the no doubt a movement and you help write to a again talk a little bit about
12.93,21.78, the work he did on that article absolutely so it's three or four tears with the interception brown and will perish and basically we obtain a leak from a tiger son employee
21.81,28.35, has given us more than documents internal situation reports that paternoster between november and may
28.35,36.12, at which his energy counterpart nor so the privacy and in addition to that we also obtain more than a public records
36.3,41.28, really robert some of the leaks material we have and also showed the level of
41.28,44.31, in between private and not private
44.52,51.6, and law enforcement and i think the documents to a lot of things really they showed really massive surveillance for
51.75,56.82, went on throughout the protest they show infiltration on base aerial surveillance
56.94,62.94, the monitoring of activist words i sometimes we've got really detailed reports of what's happening inside the camps
63.15,67.83, shows the fact that peterson and other private security firms
67.89,81.33, presence in the camp and were there listening and reporting back to the employer but i actually think that one of the most fascinating things that revealed in this weeks is really the extent of the collaboration between private security firms and pale
81.42,88.53, not sanctioned in any contract right so the client for tigers on was energy transporters private oil company
88.59,91.8, same time paterson was feeding the situation reports
91.92,102.69, she to patterns investigations to the bi so really does is something quite quite revealing in quitting i think that i'm sure as
102.69,108.99, imperatives community and hear people talking about it very disturbing really you have terming
109.05,110.79, of people's names
111.24,114.15, really detailing formation about their
114.42,120.9, license plates numbers all their activities sometimes they were following people across state lines and feeling all this material to enforcement
121.65,122.67, that's
123.21,134.4, i think for people know for reinterpretations and so people are new this was sort of happening but nobody would believe them and now they're kind of out there and the like oh like this is what we're talking about everybody
134.49,136.98, the parents
137.31,152.61, you public private collusion and like how was this happening like you know where was the space as these are happening and beginneth essonnes ing thing i find is the fact that this was not as i mentioned it was not sentiment was not public knowledge of this was happening
152.64,160.47, it happened on the day today is that tiernan that were on the ground reticences and i and whatever other laforce ment agency was on the ground
160.5,164.7, we welcome sometimes less so i mean something they talk about in the reports
164.82,168.06, the effort to get some police some shares departments
168.21,174.81, respond more aggressively to progress so they kind of had their own agenda in that sense to some law enforcement
174.99,180.57, very receptive of persons material some were a little bit more suspicious of their role
180.69,198.69, a basically they had a presence on the ground they also had a presence in one of these and it centers that law enforcement was running and a ready there was a level of collaboration between different agencies so we had cheese had stargeshina guard we had the bi we had tea a number of federal agencies are working together
198.69,203.28, the things that was storehouse communication that was happening between all these different groups
203.28,204.72, rotha
204.78,208.29, france one of the mails that we were able to obtain though probably records
208.32,215.64, how that law enforcement was using adaptation to wash the protests and so that's kind of that's the level of public private
215.91,218.07, that we exposed that was really
218.46,225.21, and your saying there is there is a intelligence gathering centres and and those i mean those are called like fugiens like
225.27,228.9, then within that center there was a tiger and employee
229.02,233.76, enter or something that's a ready wit slishing that's quite interesting it's
233.88,238.32, something that came about in on the tail of the so called war on terror and it was
238.35,241.11, for stablish meetest
241.14,245.7, have collaboration between different informants enforcement agencies to
246.57,260.22, counterterrorism prosaically so we are ready have different agencies local state and federal working together which is something that you know is problematic town and in addition to that we had tiepolo at the actual physical place
260.34,265.47, enforcement coronation was happening so they had a reason placed in one of these fugiente
265.62,274.29, and where again fitting them information working with them and so they think this is i mean this is something that's not completely unusual like we've seen some level of private public
274.56,278.61, on over a surveillance of anapoests you know there are private
278.76,284.55, companies for instance there are collaborating with law enforcement in surveillance of banister activists and other groups
284.67,288.45, a descent obesely just how expensive that collaboration is
288.75,309.36, speaking of tucson to like they started in the middle east doing private security work and they brought some of that language they're using their two hearts speak to that little ones a company that's mostly been doing defense contracts overseas they operate in several different countries but most of the work has been done in the anahita again in the so called war on terror and i think actually one of the things that
309.6,346.95, disturbing about this report is that the fact that they were able to operate in such an unchecked manner in the us against us citizens just makes you wonder what the hellenes like where there's absolutely no scrutiny oversight nobody patteson to what they're doing but was also interesting is that you know this is a military fence contractor that then come home and bring bringthereout direct action as attacks they talk about the camps as a battlefield at some point they described them movement and compared to a shadow i thought was
348.18,354.27, i mean about warrantably can give your sense of the level of hostility and militarism
354.63,355.74, in
356.67,371.13, they using that language of the report so as sentinels the future connote saying his reports that the language that they brought from doing work in iraq absolutely and none of the other things that we should in one of the stories is that tiresome was feeding his intelligent reports that it was preparing
371.34,379.08, energy concert there it was also sending them to warehousemen and it was communicated with lenormant about some of the things he observed on the ground so for instance
379.2,382.53, the reports quite a bit is racial profiling of
382.65,384.66, nor activists of
384.84,393.75, presuming we know not what it is so course but in one instance there is animal chain that we looked at in which
394.11,398.19, but none of this my first man talks about
398.46,399.78, activists of
399.96,409.53, she origin for trouble he receives and comely shows it is level of paranoia and really racial profiling that came from tiensiert
411.48,414.3, i for
414.3,428.34, i was wondering too is so when i was on the ground there the sheriff would talk a lot about the need to do things lawfully and how like tyrant being lowlands idea of lawful and so was tiresias the work they are doing as they have to day where they do 
429.99,455.49, not have a visit actually another revelation of the story tiersot have continues not half a periodicity working north dakota so they have permitted other states where they are also operating and in our ecoutait they were doing it consulting work which is of course a very limited part of what they were doing to distant have a license the section something it was just confederation because
455.52,463.2, a lot of people just assumed all of this must be illegal and in fact because pierson is a private security for a lot of it is messily i mean
463.23,467.07, things are very unethical and shady but they're not necessarily breaking on the law
467.64,476.46, allusion centers are within the public domain and theory and someone's a chance that the public can access their information but tiger son
476.7,481.86, i mean the only reason why we were able to report on an this is because we got a lacrosse
481.98,485.37, interesting is that the stuff we obtain to public records request
485.49,493.44, it so sometimes you know we had the private obtained document from tiger son and then a version of that document which was also shared with lamorce
493.53,501.87, was shared with enforcement it became public record i also think that it is an untiring toes out really is that you know a enforcement has much higher standards
501.99,507.42, it comes to what they should chesnay when it comes to acting people's privacy people the right to
507.42,508.86, semble and protest
508.95,513.57, you know they have allegations to constitutional rights that private companies don't necessarily have
513.57,523.53, because this relationship between pierson and law enforcement was not sanctioned in any contract it's a lot more difficult to make the case that tigernach were officially
523.53,529.59, contractors they did have public contracts and so they were just feeding and you know intelligence and other information
529.68,534.21, early making themselves accountable to the levels of catinat law enforcement has
534.39,538.5, i mean i think one thing quite interesting what is is not a coastal has some
538.68,543.18, open publican formation of laws you can request a lot of information
543.18,549.45, many journalists now like when you do do reclassification you'll have to fight them and keep at it and really
549.54,558.39, to get information you do have a right too but in some states you don't even have to i mean really getting any kind of continents from law enforcement and the low part of the
558.66,559.65, i think you know
559.74,565.17, i hope his documents do as we're doing at the intercepts publishing all the documents because i think
565.44,566.52, much in the
566.73,573.87, can be can be learned about and that people that were on the ground and activists and other groups that came under surveillance can use his documents
574.29,582.9, that's you know useful to them were also hearing from eyes that are hoping to use some of this stuff in court and so because the documents are so expansive we're just
583.29,590.19, to departure really of course we're doing audience you know we like very fine documents that were also
590.22,594.45, all of them in contacting every single person that gets named in them which is
594.72,604.32, why we're all in it you know we're all in and out a few weeks at a time because there is so much in their thousands and dozens of people that get named and we want to make sure they have a chance to
604.56,608.46, before we realize our names and if we don't get a hold of them we have redactors
608.85,627.87, ivery time frame that we could neepeelootambo were speaking on you know there's not starkweather going to release all these documents are time frame would be altogether to the story we hoping to you knowing
628.02,631.65, well it's a pretty time consuming process to go through them and for that time
631.8,650.37, we have documents from trieste way through me so we'll probably release those in the next few weeks but were also doing additional reporting on things that were learning about from the document so we're looking at other pipeline fights for instance and that actually on the stories that you as might look out for were looking at was discussed
650.4,653.22, people that have been arrested in the protest and 
653.67,661.17, those stories as well as i was just say where else is tigrera within and they're still contracted at
661.23,671.91, the contractor dakota as the documents show that were actually operating in a well linton thing in that actually are interesting they had a pretty strong presence here in chicago
672.12,677.82, he looked at connections between the antient pamment and other activists groups so why the end
677.91,680.37, the documents we have so all the way to my
680.37,682.53, see how tigers is
682.56,685.98, pictet its client as a potential
686.04,692.37, soon other fights they follow activists so the climate marching in washington they talk about other
692.52,707.19, the fights that are happening in a post danilovgrad and one thing to keep in mind i think that's important is that parson is a for profit company and it's very able when you read this report that they were trying to make a case with a client that the situation on the ground was
707.28,712.56, the much more volatile than it actually was so they could justify the very expensive residence there
714.57,758.67, to say that at this time thanks for speaking to that so i mean i know that our audience we spent a lot time there and i know just sitterson there is no aspirate privation there was all this sort of actions to tithingmen and miss anacoluthon that attentive surveillance and security and infiltration and foreshows how cascarillero this movement and how eatin the movement was the pride of it of its a its losses as well you know the you don't do this if you don't really fear does not love with this tone and i think if anybody can tie consolation at the denoument is that that reticence
759.78,793.47, thank you pantheist a little charlie on the other sat a rather tiresome documents leaks take look at these stories really informed of it looking forward to irvington is there a bullet hole of you or you waterfront ranting to tell us about tigers or your interactions with them you recollect all that information is an interesting sight for one of our posterities we are still the people submit we're going to be trying to find an solitaries about i
793.47,809.07, in suffolk that and then this brigham to you live i know that we have been liable the working on trying to find it ascertain sense of interest and to say the names yet in case they fall through but there coming let's pretty again comitates to our best
809.19,811.14, can support our work
811.14,812.49, a little bit
