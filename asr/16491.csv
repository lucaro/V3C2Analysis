337.26,368.91, i don't think bullionist why would you want to bully if you one of bully than the mean to your insecure and near a bad person on the inside your mad for a reason but you just don't know how to express it really blind never can claypole if they believe a person like every time when somebody gets bullied people be like all i want to kill myself all i want to do that teleprobe them up
369.09,377.7, priorities is your guys safety and i know that sometimes bullying can cause the victim to hurt themselves and i would never want any of you guys to hurt yourself

525.54,530.97, i can i can infect it can make a better by my having
531.12,582.96, in about things that were sent to you that you felt lavacombe her train make the person filled better and never never let make the person till angry about the self antikities well what i think that we indifferent happening in my life that make me put the fact on her and become front become friends with her and get on with life within speak up to parents teachers with inspector new people we can speak of a whole bunch o other people instead of just keeping into a yerselves unwearied situation because bullying
583.2,596.79, with either handle it for our souls they think that they can handle themselves but when it gets our control it or know what to do children do really tell their parents and they're getting belief they hold they did until they really
596.88,646.29, that emotional voted and such one person and one person gets pushed too hard and now they're upset and illness and up in a fight and if at the end up in a flat the other person would have some linscott consequences nowadays if you bully someone he say someone gets in a fight and you up load the video so many people can share like people in china can share your your video now that that's a thing schools have adopted a no tolerance policy for bullying so we don't let it happen because a lot of bad things come from it fingerless all the same things admiration she had intention we teachers or adults are wetherell place to get help if her
646.56,679.05, they make a shake hands dangers go right back to bully and never works on dante don't think that it's the defense kids lie about a just to get attention so they pushed them away until they really realize that these kids were lying and that they were being bullied parents showed beware of wonder tales getting bullied because when you get bullieve the type of sad face all the time and you always go on being like okay for example it if i was home
679.2,709.83, what if i was at home right and like my mom didn't see me talking in like cold i took to my place of a saw in my mind and something and and he saw me so that i was said and she was no less a wilmecote would ask me like if something was happening at school that she should now be teachers or no about this and take care of it so shall parents
709.83,713.79, still i hate to have courtship to the dogs
714.81,726.87, and let them handle as long as adults are alerted that it's happening as long as somebody knows that there's bullying going on then they can do something about it i do promise in plain
727.38,731.13, mentor role to kinspeople
731.19,769.5, speaking of someone whom they feel carl he got to tell your parents you have to tell an adult you have to tell somebody so we could take action however if we don't know if the adults in a building don't know that it's going on then we won't be able to do anything about it on the teaching the snitcher did handle but i did listen to her because at that time i didn't care of what he said so i think that she did do something she thought the prince was stuff and to my mother but i thought that i believe care about you so just kept on buying it so i think that the right their best escapable her by it was working
773.34,780.69, some samoan open a program about building free
781.83,787.2, that means there's no bullying no whatever
788.04,792.39, no being mean to any one than you should get like
792.39,801.54, social worker for them or counseling to calm down the issue and tell them how you feeling so you won't think it on to another person since i am like
801.66,812.37, i usually stand up to that person i say why you bullying this big this person when he shouldn't smaller than you i think that the person who is getting bullies
812.46,830.76, one does tell the center on their own but sometimes it doesn't happen when i saw other people going on the people in incanting because i thought it was funny in the way they were buying the person and i thought that i can keep on going with it so i
830.76,835.2, i bullied the person to and also that
835.41,844.41, i retire somebody boys somebody i don't care what they're doing in just an follow what they're doing in this poniarding at it and laughing at it
844.62,859.95, as for basically what i've seen throughout like my class and in the lunchroom and outside i don't see a lot of bullying on on maybe i've seen one or two things but i don't usually see somebody bullying somebody else
860.04,861.81, really happens and
862.35,863.61, and your friends
863.88,868.65, that is always there like we were walking to another class right
868.65,886.14, miserably the principal right there is in life their over protective but some people think that but i think that they will not this is a school so people people probably got expressed their type of 
886.17,892.08, what they do what their difference from someone else does all
892.32,906.12, making students apologize students locomote talk into the adults in this building and we have a much smaller group of students so we get a chance to monitor everybody at a higher rate
906.81,926.34, by is a worse or better in any other schools and i and schools where the behavior problems were the adults are more strict than there are alessandro because of fear of
926.4,928.35, i fear me
928.44,930.42, trouble or anything like that
930.45,933.03, so
933.45,943.32, i have seen a tiny bit a bullying and i've been reported that i'd been a bully to somebody else too but i think it's not happening less but
943.35,948.33, time gets more as it progresses that i think
948.51,950.76, there will be more ability
950.82,958.08, have students got into engage in a few conflicts of course but i have not been alerted to buying during the school year
958.44,963.81, i think most of the time it's the bully was and sometimes it can be locatable
964.05,969.99, certainly isn't the person being bullied fault that they are being bored it definitely not their full
970.2,984.66, in both the bullies form and the person who is getting belief because one the bolletino be doing that to the person because they know is wrong and to the person who getting bullion
985.14,991.65, because that they should be coming to cease as soon as it starts a just waiting there
993.66,1020.84, it was my fault because i should have never let my anger gone her whatever was happening i should let but her go by me and fixed upon myself and i say of this stuff about what's happening to my life and bring it on to her being a bully was okay for me and then i could just keep on to ayclough that i'll be cautious everybody else was going on and that 
1021.02,1022.13, thought that
1022.25,1030.65, so in that i wanted to be a colossal by every was okay you know when you're younger there's a lot of pure pressure
1030.68,1074.27, students especially in middle school and in the early grades of high school it's very important that your viewed by your peers as somebody that is cool or somebody that is you know funeral and older and you start establishing yourself more you kind of learned that if anybody is mean to you or anybody isitsoornot that i should have never bother and i should have set sorry and so but then on the other hand i got that i can be colarossi's anything or do anything with her
1075.14,1080.03, i was a boy i was somewhere a popular kind
1080.51,1085.85, i had an image of old i felt like it was necessary to have others feel
1086.03,1088.64, maria than i was
1088.64,1089.54, the time
1089.75,1091.88, i would say anything would be on mine said
1091.97,1115.73, it's not cold to have all the kids think that the less of than you are they can really be terrible i can really affect people in terrible ways if they're being belied i think that my friend and travice up learning from the situation that he's got he had to stand up for himself i think that something he had to learn was had as advocate for himself had as he matured picks on him and not
1115.94,1120.98, do things for people said that way he would make people happy at a stand up a brand person
1121.37,1139.31, it'll get worse it'll get harder but it'll be over middle school does not last for ever just try to find someone you chase aged friend a teacher and yet they go all your best friend teacher met good people try to be a good person
1141.59,1144.41, to take too much of the time but i was
1144.89,1147.47, billy and i was but
1147.47,1150.17, promise us inmates kid again

1152.87,1155.36, that i would have my pay at
1155.72,1157.91, i saw this young man
1159.17,1160.79, maybe a few years ago
1161.57,1162.77, and
1162.8,1165.17, he was a young man who was
1165.2,1166.73, at a train station
1166.91,1168.02, asking for money
1168.71,1169.79, and
1170.21,1172.07, he worked me initially
1172.37,1174.89, but i recognized him and
1175.16,1181.67, he reintroduced myself you know i told my was and we had a slight conversation and began to cry
1181.97,1184.16, and i didn't cry but i felt
1184.22,1201.17, the same emotion ah what i can say about about him at that moment as a histology him because we were young kids he made me feel very bad and he expressed how apologetically was
1201.23,1209.18, and i took his word for
1210.98,1251.3, the sister is teetotalers teetotallers
