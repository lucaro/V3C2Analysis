13.77,17.67, already a scatter the jam what go
18.12,27.57, okay garments can use twelve for flabbily and that's what she's going to be using in her upcoming music idea so i'll let her stick with us
27.6,47.94, not usually the dumbell be at the floor so let's go ahead and put those life for instance if you're working out with somebody you would finish your story and put him down on the floor and move away and they would come and they would do their set and get em on the floor so i tell you what go ahead and do that naturally and show them what tablelike
48.39,55.32, take a seat on the end of the benches with the smaller nose not the flatter side if you've got one like that
56.07,57.63, over and reach him
57.96,60.84, right there behind your knees on your 
61.68,63.18, together
63.57,64.95, it down
65.46,108.06, now this exercise the dumb bells are proud of you recite a meshisha means all right like right now they're pretty good but it's not necessarily natural to do that usually you put them right over where your shoulder joints are that's just the most natural place put him but where they go is over your rebate a see that's just an inch or whatever forward and gay and they stay level kay so they're not like the sky and there together and everything like that that is your starting position you want to feel balance it's a neutral balance is where they start now the movement
108.57,135.06, let me back i mean those shoulders down and redcoats true and everything that we do say all upper body exercises its stabilize the locations of your shoulder joint it's very important and an insurer no strain on them that's very very important and it ensures that the right muscles are working and that the right muscles are doing the right thing say remember to ride a mount program it's also a right
135.36,156.06, level of each detail okay so we got that whole balance in a lime thing assure you sick of hearing about balance and linen so let me see this one come dan to the said good i'm sorry i mean both of them all i let me see both of them come down to the sad good and back
156.3,160.08, that was good and can
160.17,177.57, the elbow the elbow is in the least straining position when it points to the side but now hers is pointed this way out towards our jim windows not so what she did as she took his arm and she went
178.26,204.72, you do that from the shoulder joint okay guess what you can do that all day long from the shoulder joint that's what the shoulder joint does say that the part of what we mean by rotator cuff we rotate the upper arm bone the ball of the upper arm on his in the shoulder joint capsule and we rode at nantasket the shoulder joint is called it a very confusing title
204.93,207.99, so you got to have a seton
211.98,216.75, and that party much concludes the instruction on this one so open
217.92,234.66, close can you do him a more commendably like to hold on hold on go back to the south what i want you to watch for you do have to watch how the vibrations are emanating on her body and you'll later you'll see it on the music vidout we want and you
234.75,241.26, there camels so you picture muscles that on the outside
241.29,278.76, you know of the rebate it's like a bearer you pitch or the muscle tissue this is called external its external of our skeleton the vital organs are in the middle so you pitchers patting of muscle and you grip it milly you just want a firm grip of your riptyles do that as you prepare to open the first one and then you'll feel how those repasses actually are providing the energy to wag your arm the shoulder joint is to stain in the sector sedately just to hand now what your due to good ones
287.91,298.47, turning now to turn a man philip i'm going to bring my knees up to meet him because it's easy air for us we forgot and do the mountain the dismal one more time
301.47,312.54, and turn him on enamored turn wrong exercise okay and the dismal good kate i want to talk to that one more time no not the mount to the
314.13,327.6, leon this distant you take these you know you're a control of them and you storming them forward as you lift your knees and they met each other and set you up to do that more those forward
327.96,337.23, if you don't move him forward first you don't have that momentum momentum it is everything i mean we don't ever strain ourselves so one last time on the mount distant
337.86,343.23, do one good rap on good bisgood center over her recent good rub
345.63,482.1, and you're done god does forward okay that's all for teaching at bent plateau to get hoodooed thank you thank you very much she illimitable flies are unique exercise
482.22,486.12, you to feel the muscles of your rib cage
486.12,526.41, a unique combination of muscles that are designed to work together and no other exercise allows you to feel it like that were always talking about upper back we're talking about upper chest all the time but the way the number on either side of your rib cage allows you to feel tension really it's like a grip that's all around your ribcage you just tense the muscles all ran you rotate as how you control yourself and all the other upper body exercises so it's a unique lesson that you use in every other upper body exercise think about that i'll see a sin
