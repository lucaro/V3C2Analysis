30.45,33.42, volumes about the nature of photography
33.42,38.28, well as david's personality was really only about 
38.31,47.37, if i pleistocene things that david causes not book which i would argue is a loose flitwick bound in alexix
47.73,58.35, as relations were not postponements
58.47,62.22, last year and it's alisaunder short period to
62.49,76.05, in addition to being an award winning some publisher david has a day job working as a director of photography and cebes outdoor as well as contributing regularly to emerging carogne and ran commerce
76.38,82.17, as photographs are in many promotions in cutting icy pinner and resonant and his
83.13,94.92, early years he attended his school visual arts the new school for social research were studied anatomy clearly serapion and i spoke
95.1,101.73, time david and has taught himself let about poverty with the farewell and continues to share his knowledge
102.15,105.93, even more freely and even more freely his opinions
106.17,108.54, but the world is the world of large
108.9,110.52, i sat
110.7,112.47, he ate
112.53,115.05, i once
115.29,125.34, he therefore hint she said a lot of it to some of his immortal aright
125.49,126.99, the deal
127.71,133.38, i'm towering early 
133.56,136.23, i did a lot of commercial work in early 
136.32,142.2, i reinforced with photogen called the image back and the hovering as it had as any more
142.2,146.55, become a getting bought and i shot a lot of stock in the ages
146.88,151.47, and when a sousoulito stock agape and making money i snapshotting for myself
152.1,154.74, the percession was to start
154.83,159.33, caring about the money part at photo agency and such etymon stuff again
159.93,163.98, and manganese her myself a while
164.79,168.36, everything in my book starts pretty much in the
169.38,171.63, sort of my personal vision of the world
171.84,175.17, really how i feel about talking about photography
176.22,179.37, so i assumed renders oodles
179.7,182.28, he might in the name is probably the
182.61,188.76, two or three greatest living photograph right now pretty much and robert frank and the freeland i say it three greatest living bodies
189.57,192.87, no moving out of matters lidarwat
193.26,197.1, those of the soetkin of news it with this
197.34,198.24, so
199.44,201.0, a being said
201.36,205.92, talbot the ography which is an irony in that
206.4,212.22, so i have four books out the first book was a collaboration with the gallery that used to represent me
212.28,217.23, was bastards a catalog for his gallery to some photographs a ten year retrospective
217.5,218.58, and
218.91,225.18, i know he said that it cercamorte in turn to it cutover hard covered book with a
225.66,229.5, tipped in photographs that we went out kind of crazy
229.74,234.66, that is well my relationship with to and the seasoning my books and
235.23,242.19, that two more books which i controlled everything when they came out they said if i was going to make books and to me but on the best way to waterford
242.28,244.47, people have having shoes but
244.65,246.24, a transient
246.57,255.78, looking at pictures you know on like that i shall if people crowding enoshima to show right now in new york and the museum is sitting new york that fetid
256.17,260.94, i really went to the opening and after that i think back to me senechaussee wall
261.24,273.21, since every but i want parts i want to be able to sit in a bed and a chair and footrope ures and really taken every photograph of inveterate do it and that's why botmane to me and that's why the last two books is sort of
274.08,279.24, self published on but i did it with the cooperation of a lot of people helping out and
280.35,281.49, the first book
281.82,285.9, actually not a photograph of the book this is a bed but looking like the book
286.47,290.43, the second book which will in presence to keep lowering the ink levels
290.43,292.47, you couldn't see it any more
292.56,294.93, that satisfied by the white album
295.2,298.98, it is almost a bookstore hated
299.01,303.06, the passion i see poker actually said to me how are they mirette what this is
303.06,306.3, then they sold them all out the first week that the potatoes there you go
306.75,308.58, and this is the last box
308.97,311.61, this is the truth about how i would have tied
312.81,313.71, but
317.58,319.17, this is what i do
319.29,320.31, so
320.46,324.6, a talk about commercial or because i think it boadicea it
324.6,327.0, i write a common range finder which is
327.03,329.1, eversmann
329.22,331.8, it's the personal work of professional photographers
332.37,339.93, the pleasure that is about somebody else when i do photo cause i don't do any of the corporate stuff because it doesn't matter to me what matters is what you're doing is it together
340.11,342.3, what you look at what you say
342.99,347.58, i think righteousness theories don't have any person or
347.73,355.47, they do but which just like the stuff they should for money so mostly i find the tires for themselves a cannon make a living 
355.71,361.11, we don't stop that in public because then the whole premise is gone so welcome to this
363.96,372.78, in looking around pretty much everything is the same person actually by the way if you think this is funny at all i don't bulamatadi
372.9,376.89, and i was told a long time ago i can't come pictures but i really don't take funny
380.67,382.5, happy pictures
382.68,384.45, opposite
385.08,393.33, have somebody somebody bought his photographs there alienate he's always miserable and she literally for this in her office because that's perfect said guess i don't know
394.77,396.63, that kid in the back
396.87,402.27, the background after the natatory what was a slim two years ago that hither
403.92,406.77, i had new york that was around the block for us
407.07,408.78, a little boy with a big trick
410.1,415.11, everything i thought aramis really about myself and what i see in the world and how i look at it
417.12,423.03, like a lens classes or in know what you guys talked about in the tribute to me at ography is all that yourself
423.15,425.76, people ask me what subtilitate
426.06,429.99, just about me walking around and kind of like a little kid going on that and that weird
430.08,432.69, that's pretty much percent of everything they shoot
432.72,433.74, for me
433.98,438.45, look at this and put that was weird actually i'm in this picture was a workin that
439.23,445.08, a hotel bar in a room i was traveling in my friend in texas we have from texas
446.97,451.41, so i don't know whether your boy ease this was the honeymoon sweep
451.89,462.99, had no roseville and i wonder reflect or bucks and they say you know for another twenty bucks got a honeymoon sleep so they sought was the honeymoon sweet where is a bag behind me was like a regular room and the honeymoon par
463.26,464.73, so
465.06,469.98, you noticed they must have just back in the heart of man up there cause tinkerer
471.3,478.62, in moscow in moscow the first time in ninety one and i bet this is anything have made that up i don't remember
478.68,481.83, the most intelligent of the pictures my lab puts a deep
482.04,484.53, the envelop and that's usually the way i can tell
484.77,486.6, in moscow in the winter
486.63,491.28, and one of the things interesting about i mean obviously i could to things in boxes
491.28,497.94, yet at alienation know why i didn't know this to my first book would being edited and the person adding it was in this last
498.48,504.3, she laid all these princes and as were walking shortening in order the cosmics the boxes are
504.33,508.53, the boxes and you know when you put things in boxes and put boxes as
508.65,514.35, it's not going to be thinking about boxes every time i get to the lecture but apparently for a lot of things in boxes
514.41,520.08, so this woman in russia is boxes and if you see the candles i later learned this is so the flowers don't freeze
520.5,524.25, make it warm enough that they don't use its cold and russia
526.47,529.83, this is interesting this is i just read in that article
529.89,530.88, this is
530.91,534.75, ironic because it's a big betook like you should fly takes in it
534.84,543.12, in case i don't even know if that's what i thought but i like it so that's going to be my story going forward we at the big decoration the otello
543.33,561.72, we were here to we went to the speech it's in the satirist to look at it one day i saw the sign and it was really a sort of a plain kynast interested in taking it the bane o there's a picture there so one day was driving around in the clouds ronador the ocean i said oh i got to get down there and i couldn't find it and i went to lake two beeches in the clouds or coming in i found that again
562.05,564.63, i took the picture of it and i'm not even sure
564.72,567.63, but but i think it's funny this is one i admit is fun
568.38,571.32, he got so in nineteen eighty seven
572.34,575.64, an ancient for the image bank i went to the
576.45,581.37, preface it would disintegrate entire canada for i three or four weeks before the olympics had then
581.58,584.64, my job is starting a maritime and work my way corsetiere
584.91,586.8, get every
586.86,591.12, province to pictures in it so they can use it for the olympics for this book that was coming up
591.54,593.58, and so they would have pictures
593.64,598.35, so i got to go to the arctic not here but a place called tucky upon
598.38,602.1, in north of yellow and yer up there in his basically
602.28,621.9, there danusia's and like a bunch of guys in big boots were dirty looking for oil so this is weird contrast the only white people they say pretty much are orestes and canadian or american would have rolls they're not thrilled with us up there but i went up there and i said i want to go to the art that this is cool so i think i convinced them the senate arctic
621.96,623.67, i think the premise was
623.82,628.71, orographic and stuff like that that air cannon and people could use for their
628.74,636.18, advertisements and actually the first time i went i photograph icicles hanging off an iceberg and motioned for their most an ice camping
636.48,640.32, the biggest ever made i think back then in s i think i got
640.95,647.31, for the bit of the iceboats like a big like tallow but night was really the
647.31,650.64, without children or utterers orderlies
650.85,655.14, anyway i want it so much this is the kids
655.32,661.14, he and the child of this guy alistening he was an initiation that part of
661.41,663.39, have
663.84,667.35, anna of the northwest territory which is now called something else
668.88,672.9, with these guys for like days days and just live on the land
673.2,678.33, i bernenstein this isn't even that cold this is kind of the spring time this is the first time i went
678.57,687.33, i just would live with them and choose for stock the stuff they need you know so justified being there but a kind of just hangout with the photographs so this is probably three in the morning
687.81,689.76, by the way this time o year it's light all the time
690.03,703.98, so basically you don't know what's going on you know it's just life and suddenly it's like something your exhausted kind of like her second those we gaieties all the time and you tideshead for thirty hours like a hose and i remember it was that
703.98,706.2, i think my wife said was like in the morning
706.26,707.16, and
707.43,708.78, one of the men
708.96,714.12, i came out immediately because i thought i heard somebody these do or hanging out just calling so chillen
714.45,726.63, and so i was too and they're sitting there and there watching for homesteadin the middle of it so that was reassuring that eight year old and a thirteen year old were going to protect me from being even by poorer
726.78,728.91, as a sidenote about
729.0,732.3, third or fourth time i went up there in the winter going forward
732.51,734.19, i took out
734.22,738.27, but it hours to get out to the flow at this part of the ocean
738.45,740.22, we got there said we
740.4,743.61, i said oh he was but i'll go get some
743.88,753.06, i said okay and i mean really he's saying and he incurs the greatest guy my kids middle name is alive it because of this get what he did say to me i'll be back in a little while
753.24,756.66, and he left me and my friend joe and it just like that
757.02,761.16, in the middle of the night and darkness with the cold and burner to burgers
761.28,762.42, come
762.51,764.67, he warm while he was gone
764.76,765.9, no for
765.93,779.1, sleeping bags that we a pounds because and you know when you're in the leaking beds if it blow it's interesting if you do exist and are gets in your screameth our case that's going to be like a shining on the other thing happened to get paid
779.43,785.76, teething too this is a life decision so anyone willing to initiate
786.18,794.34, joe decides a much otis is weird man cause we don't have gone and could be called bears in any way were atonement and is now night and he snoring
794.7,807.6, as a sleep like this stairway is to go by there travels manicures of him coming at the josette and me all the time and joseph leaped snoring really lad which probably attracts followed and he snoring under his leaving bed
808.23,809.37, and
809.64,820.77, the morning oh i idiome back the next day so we're only there for that eighteen hours alone and alice back and next day and he had food and everything and joe academican you sleep when you were it is i took a few value
820.8,832.08, i like you too valiant in the arctic ore and this actually continued into some russian escapades where we are traveling from i think moscow to tolleston and we were told
832.17,867.15, no one more it's early you know russia was so his breaking up there's no raw there's no law any more there's no protect you to lock your door on the train when you're going to because what they is they not on the door and say their customs and then you the kill you and take your stuff and like a great and is but the other thing they also do as they clumped esther under the door and that not so well so you had to actions of had it go down so were in the ordinating travelling in a bongrand and you know i'm jerry swam thinking about is like germany you know and i like cold and the dancing train and it was horrible and at one point i said to joe if they do say passport at the door do we not open it
867.3,870.57, if we don't open it don't think like a restless we have to and i sleep
872.13,879.27, and i'm like a plucky did it again so he went to sleep and i parted at the doors of spincourt when we had some border or somewhere
879.45,884.25, by the by the baseborn and might artist and i appointed kill us because that's
884.25,890.88, if i did i wouldn't be here so yes and same guenes this is the arctic in the middle of the middle of night
891.18,899.97, i like the stuff comes out of a photograph as a sort of side note of hate i love not a hand comes in on a wire that is something in there that feels like he is a rest of the world behind him
902.46,906.66, to me this is kind of near here this is vague
907.2,910.68, actually called to the parting laetitia
911.85,922.83, this is i don't even know this i guess this is one of those jacobins but they called joshua ottawaites for many this christmas
922.89,929.85, to go every one this is like the potato mutations
930.0,933.06, he used to be to get all every one being
933.21,936.03, we go to everyone to camp out in the winter
936.12,939.93, this was on the road why we did it in the winter because in the day time you can supply
940.38,942.12, okay this i guess a box
942.18,948.12, a list one of the land of the mostly on the out on the land they have these little cabins
948.12,949.86, there also their about
950.04,954.12, at the side of this for on this usually about in it in it warming up
954.18,975.81, the elation that square and there also reintegrate and yet not also and this a giant cockaine corner of the room and that's where the refuge goes which is pretty exciting the first time or in that she basically suffocating and telling your and everybody eatenus in the room is in the corner thomascat road and there taken chancing to my janus
976.02,981.51, so the red cap it's awful actually care was not that better a seal is an awful thing to 
981.57,992.13, they know well that the meaning and stuff i know it's never did that that was the canadians the french canada pemaquid kill him them and getting on t v and like abusing sealed he initialed them eat them and make close of it
992.19,996.06, that terrible clothing on the ground there so well that lives can
996.87,1003.38, this is me this is like what i learned recently ruinart about this i've noticed over like the last eraste the same picture all over the world
1003.41,1007.64, the same picture so this to me in this to me and is to me all the same shot
1007.88,1009.71, this is up there
1009.98,1013.55, this is down there and this is never house
1013.67,1017.06, but i don't even know why attractive these boxes but i am
1017.81,1020.6, these here which maybe it's a good time to talk about it
1021.29,1023.48, i see the little right there that ship
1024.23,1026.78, okay so when i was an art school
1027.02,1030.35, i used to get these little things in pictures and say that the teacher is really cool
1030.59,1033.89, this beintein extra thing i was really lucky
1033.89,1039.05, a semester she said to me you know if it keeps happening it's not luck
1039.23,1047.33, may not be aware of it's not well to instant reason says lottie have partitions to wit who i got some cooler if they keep savant's not what you're doing something
1047.93,1053.66, i always think about it in this picture because you know i'm looking at this thing trying to balance it with the sky and the whole thing
1054.02,1058.37, nothing was there to me that's luck and i would not you care that that's it but matters to me
1058.37,1060.44, cuthfert have used the picture
1062.09,1065.87, maybe i should give every body that came carelessly
1066.92,1071.18, this is actually the same this is the first time i saw the notes that when there was no call
1071.24,1072.59, near the open
1072.98,1075.05, i know what that sitting there actually
1075.71,1077.36, so
1077.42,1079.13, a certain point in my life
1079.67,1087.68, i got married wonder i married an editor from the agency that reply who later became a shrink so opinion
1089.06,1096.08, we had these kids and taken features of kids was always really weird to me in mastered to and had kids in my thirties
1096.32,1103.49, it was killin beings never really photographed moisten their deal there was in strange i didn't relate to them
1103.85,1114.62, relate to them now but now i start photogram estate my own and it's like a built in subject so you always have somebody to take a picture so this is a place we have not been made and this is my son bouncing on a rock
1114.89,1116.93, the lake from our deck
1117.05,1123.23, about this as i like this picture is one of my favorite pictures actually it tells one of the most epicures and people seem to like it
1123.62,1125.24, something action like
1125.42,1131.87, but the point of the picture is i actually so many email me said a horrible picture that can drown in
1132.11,1139.19, no my wherewithal to drown in the fonder like
1139.97,1147.05, he's back there this but this is the thing about having my kids with a doll i think i started my kid thing to early in the
1147.23,1148.94, do
1149.21,1163.34, actually found out later people not them over before storms i didn't live in the suburbs and witnesses as well they were live the city in other places he came out after the serbs of people didn't in plantigrade would lay them down and he never knew what to their blowing down they took before a storm of escaping
1164.03,1165.71, this one favorite pictures
1165.74,1168.41, again my kids get credit as were on a family vacation
1168.65,1170.63, similar florida
1170.63,1172.28, to me this
1172.61,1185.72, funny it is seen again i don't see the funny but i i i get them reaching in part but to me this is like the best i can do in a pott's not maybe my best for her but to me i've done everything i ever wanted to notice the sudden interesting in the middle
1186.11,1207.5, it's published in its and the closed we know that that's the little scary door there's no one knows there's the phone number of were to go to the new close opportunities the big hand on what i don't know if it's sexes i'm sure i do i believe in that day and he's reaching into the tables otherwise matrimony and his cloudy which is like an editorial buntin and his telephone wires
1207.53,1210.59, i didn't know that i did all the time but i learned
1210.68,1212.48, no robert from
1212.48,1219.83, yet we welcome as prices and he hates them and i realized or he said he hates somebody incorporates them to make you know need them
1219.92,1223.55, i started doing it i think robert crumple as a child when i
1223.82,1227.18, a small boy was reading a comic way to young
1227.75,1230.72, these two pictures of the same to me cause i like
1230.99,1235.13, the thing i talk about with photography is called its cold
1235.37,1249.8, i thought of something and that it is a thing in intensified to talk about organizing chaos in a photograph i think it's the number one noon thinking honors has to be interesting it's not interesting how care what you did what threshold of how you lately care like who cares
1249.89,1253.61, so pretensive that everything's interesting
1253.79,1257.75, important thing that is had organized what's going on in the picture and to organize the case
1257.87,1261.65, i think there's a native i think people haven't matatiele can learn 
1261.71,1262.67, i think
1263.06,1269.03, people see a certain way i know i see a certain way in organizing the casemate number one thing to do take nor
1269.21,1272.78, you do that inside this rectangle with a lot of stuff going
1273.17,1277.28, and this is one of the pictures i think i really got a lot of stuff right here
1277.37,1293.12, to me it's like a oyster you got me wibblesley head the black background the strain a black one here's a white wood everything makes sense is nothing i wouldn't change and when i have tonsillitis this semblance picture better without this and like if it is your picture fall
1293.21,1302.24, you can still keep it sometimes really noisome in another part of it but that sort of how i look at it and in this one i think i got him all right just like on this one there's nothing i would change it wouldn't move i wouldn't read doit
1302.3,1303.98, and that's where
1304.07,1309.98, for me anyway cottages may be they but for me it's rare and when i do it i get really excited
1311.15,1323.75, this is being sentimental with children you know i've had the same pinions he's never asked me for it i plentifully took this one which i often insult or a compliment but it took eighteen years from the sweat and one
1323.81,1340.55, i came home from shooting something else and that will shape was my son playing in the snow and as i walked at a collateral i literally was working like this like you know like a monkey or some and i saw my hands from passes i said oh this epicure and that's why you can't see my osiris my camel and like a nettle
1340.73,1343.43, so that's meilke this one
1344.0,1348.26, so i love beaches i like travelling but i like
1348.29,1352.73, each a lot i didn't know i like them because i hated him as a kid to don't like one in the water
1352.82,1354.86, i think there's a lot to photograph on the beach
1355.07,1356.06, so
1356.06,1367.76, he's actually another example maybe we don't see what you're doing and its intuitive like the stripes and the straining weather's no way it was aware of that iswara to keep his head out of the picture while he kept talking in the other guy selling subspace my picture too
1367.76,1370.49, they thought they were going to get some actually he did to get some money out of
1370.58,1374.96, you know so that to me and i like to hand coming around i was like a random hand
1375.14,1385.46, time you can get a hand at a picture that's not a tax to person i think that becomes very interesting all right so that it again in the country stuff not the one with the arms the journey but the little one
1385.55,1387.44, italy two years ago
1387.83,1401.54, said i want to picture myself looking like a cool italian kid so this is mean making it look like it's cochituate but you know it was good i like the picture enough nothing's my kittenhood
1404.3,1407.51, here's one this is a picture i'm really proud of
1407.66,1415.97, because this is one i no idea with the exposure was to make this guy silhouette and elaborated to a picture because what he did was
1416.09,1425.42, soon as he took the pictures head warbeck and the next shot in his face let which is his god so this one with the lighter at this detection at i think an interesting anyone
1425.48,1428.72, that's the place of going in new york which is where my office is sis
1428.81,1430.49, one of the developments
1432.32,1435.02, one way looks so much better on the screen 
1436.31,1440.72, here's the big kid doing the opposite of the hands now is doing a fool
1441.02,1444.8, and that's a mexican bring your kids along you can do stuff
1445.22,1456.68, that's him upside down boy by the way this is the kites on the cover of the posse magazine this thing that this picture but he never likes his face mamselle we should have his joke like he hides
1456.71,1461.66, only picture ever taken them that i kept is the one showing his face and liever the magazine so
1461.72,1463.88, the only time i gave looked at you
1464.33,1468.02, there's the same kid without in florida 
1468.08,1470.93, and he says i have a great idea for a foreign
1471.92,1476.81, some so i take my five year old age you know now i have these new subjects i don't were
1477.14,1481.61, no creditor this he said watch this and he goes and to loisette my picture
1481.61,1495.14, it's on the cover of an album now he's on a governor he has his aluminium now sadly ani's actually an artist in usagara so who know his way beyond them he figured it out
1495.74,1503.84, best question i ever got about this was being interviewed and they said that you bring them across with you 
1503.84,1510.92, ah well well i goin to find a match there of course the totally set it up
1511.13,1521.27, the berceuse why not this was excellent his as before this noise this is this is like another waimea happy with its old
1521.39,1531.62, you know it's like if there's any way i could be related to like a musician and i think his son is i feels like one of my hiawatha like it and it was may be one of the first times i really became aware
1531.83,1533.75, the telephone wire thing
1533.99,1544.58, i think maybe you know when you're at this is i think california but i think when you're doing something like this and there's no sky somethin's got to be in there and again the wires go out i like that i think it makes it interesting
1545.18,1555.26, now what else somebody said to me when they saw this the woman working on the first book said was that like you know i could trainante cursed my mind that that was a picture like a venetian 
1555.5,1557.03, turn
1559.07,1560.36, i like it
1560.66,1563.24, in outlet there that's painted over
1563.33,1567.35, interesting but mostly i like it i took this in micantes
1568.04,1572.96, about taxes no midland texas is where the bushes like a really rich
1573.32,1574.82, and with oil
1575.09,1577.37, i sat there in a really good stake
1577.49,1594.71, thinking the place one of old because every part of you know when you drive to middling you smell oil and i think in these gay the stroyed midland and ruining my stick that's what i thought about it had a horrible mill but i like that you know actually why is that you were then have that that is done
1595.28,1599.54, you no hear right here you have the flat woman
1600.71,1602.93, so i didn't like the picture
1603.2,1609.95, my wife like that she said printed its cool it might be because we're together in turkey driving down in the southern pitture in
1609.95,1611.42, but this 
1611.48,1613.58, the enterprise
1613.67,1627.83, reactionary and hesitate guy and i ran out i don't want to run over the right so i was going to take him packthread but a kind did one of these numbers you know any think the picture and then i took him at my wife as a pictureless
1628.31,1634.4, and i didn't want this picture so there's a museum in texas called the resume of fine art houston is like a big deal
1634.49,1638.57, the woman who is the curators and tucker and she's like a really big deal
1638.72,1640.76, and i got a call one day
1640.94,1644.33, from the gallery in chicago that was representing the seven deadly
1644.42,1647.96, and tuckers here and she's bin or turtle major
1647.99,1657.56, now who's antignano he goes at a canter about them but she wants to buy it and because she let and there's actually limited dishonor folio she could she just once this one i said don't give it word
1657.95,1659.75, he was no she wants to pay for 
1659.81,1661.22, she paid for it
1661.55,1673.58, then four years later when my book was coming out five years later i said to him in getting wet the introduction estancia no no i think i can do it so going back and forth like six or seven months i finally got her on the phone
1673.91,1678.38, literally on the phone she's like you know i don't even how i mean friends with her assistant
1678.56,1684.05, the move and all things made friends of the person who the big shot trusts
1684.17,1694.49, the wife the kid would ever be nice to their kids you know whenever i get access to the diction so i got out and she got in tone and she even said i think something like now
1694.61,1696.8, the girl the woman's name was her sister
1696.83,1711.83, to me that's interesting i said well here's a deal i want you to do the thing by buckshot don't really do that i said but you have my picture on your wall and your bedroom and because what's the picture i said that turtleshell he took the turtle and he stood tell me the story about what the torment her in his old thing and like the 
1711.92,1716.87, even i didn't want it this but okay my wife made me do it i really didn't have anything what she said

1736.91,1741.86, it was like an tickerlerly famous and she said she'd do it she was what you have to pay me
1742.28,1747.08, more budget problems right in case had to give the museum ten pictures
1747.83,1777.2, like you know i'll take every museum if that's the case i give you begins i was thrilled and she did it and she wrote the thing and actually hadn't put in the front because she was the one of the first people sitwell funny pictures and i thought i don't want my book people who think i'm like literature not that he's just that because he's like the greatest standpoint it in the back and make it the afterwards to the forward and she left him goes off everything i did become a afterward i said okay that's how close he's the course woman
1777.53,1788.57, the stories about bringthereout and will's talker is very important and she doesn't have like it and she's a big deal and anybody knows photography stuff no she's a big deal esculent be more regular
1788.72,1790.91, to the jection
1791.33,1795.02, the joseph kay e this is joe goes to sleep
1795.02,1798.08, antipas often the one
1799.13,1803.57, joe the first time you came up i'd been up before he wanted to go with me i said you can come 
1803.96,1812.57, we went up there and with it and the arctic as a whole scene that get their personal takes forever you got a hominous
1813.47,1818.57, you have to do this whole thing to get up the arts and contagious it's just a real pain in the neck
1818.57,1822.92, we're going up there and he told joe to get all these clothes and we've got pedagogues and almost
1822.92,1828.08, we get there and there's like the sort of it's like a settlement and you land on the tarmac
1828.23,1830.87, and you working people can get you and
1830.87,1840.11, then this is a prefect hotel thing it's really for oil workers and maybe an orange or maybe birdcatchers dauter bird within so we get in there
1840.41,1842.45, and it's on a bay on in
1842.69,1843.98, the big
1844.16,1850.34, there colvile away and joe goes i want to walk out to the certainty is not going going
1850.43,1871.7, well i'm not because i've been here before and i'm not stupid so i remember i sat in the big room and i watched him more and he goes to them his walking and then he kind of walking walking in so to back to the roman but an hour half water because back is like a ihashi i lost my glove i i don know where i drive it and it's really cold out there nothing was stay in the same size it was really far away and i said you must orlov
1871.73,1875.9, my club i said you're going to need your lot you know we're going to be here for a while
1876.11,1885.5, of course i wrote three pairs of the gloves because i'm not a so i gave oenothera and we went out but then he's kind of small and everything in the inweave him this for outfit
1885.56,1886.7, so
1886.73,1897.47, a great company but it's low nothing works is it carrie and the reason carlos and i was told us with an with every one necessitates widows told and i said
1897.65,1909.11, is hollow so your own body he keeps up these likewise insulated hairs and the hair and i know if you sit in my wife got a testiness been the arctic you sit on carabine artery get hot it's like you start to perspire
1909.11,1917.66, even i like you know when you're inside milestones like restores and earths as joe and this is how you travel that's more for
1917.66,1923.42, probably blow on being pulled across the ocean that's the land in the distance back there and you're in this box
1923.45,1932.15, in a being dreaded the by dogs or noble bull dogs are better as nubbles pounhas ted osele beneath little building i told debater
1932.3,1938.21, it's always a form of noise in the most beautiful place on and you stay in the box for eight hours
1938.36,1941.06, that you got out to day your pig
1941.87,1943.67, this is joe's haircut
1943.7,1946.76, we don't see joe but trust me getting her
1947.0,1955.04, and joe decided actually i decided that was funny where in death valley and there's a lot hartebeest i'll pay you twenty buckshot
1955.13,1958.04, really i saltpeter giving buckets
1958.1,1967.91, the joke became never let some weird place you get her so we're in istanbul he got like the worst haircut ever so he's siddartha kids watching him get his bed hard
1967.91,1969.56, this is joe
1970.19,1971.6, this is a
1971.75,1978.11, funny the joe story so actually goes before the kids really and travel with jennie kids in my wide one that him anymore
1978.11,1990.65, here we all underscore bisonoid and under the baggage looking really suspicious right that joe he don't feel an actually joe made a lot of money we are going to isabella been he goes we get to the airport
1990.71,2001.27, i have coached tickets and he goes i can't a twelve hours in a coacher i saw your noticing first pleasing a little drop for a thousand dollars to put his botanist last and it was owsley because i had never done that before
2001.39,2005.2, and we sat on the fore seasons to joke on the stained hotel
2006.7,2008.95, also so
2009.22,2023.95, up in the attic and we wanted to eat fish so joe and out was a lie on the back of a snowball tried find some intenser fishing and the way they fish up there they look for cracks cause the ice is probably told the so they find a crack they put a hook in it
2024.1,2028.33, they told me within a minute so something by poland that's arctic cap
2028.42,2030.4, when you pull them out they do this
2030.88,2040.9, and then the fruiting the gascons and that was maybe the best such ever had because the belly of the eminent descend but it's an artichoke like a lion
2041.05,2047.32, autochthones in new york it is really expensive and that was a naturally good and what weird is
2047.38,2058.06, this was in the chicago tribune the show i was having and somebody wrote about it being a sort of holy grail of the time and people seem to connect to it but i just like it joe holding a fish so it's cold so with pitch
2059.2,2070.63, it is in us like a new york city joke this is like new york joe people derogates really long and this is it like other someone emanations i don't know where it is
2071.8,2074.8, make up where that is can you tell me that is because i don't know yes
2076.57,2084.73, no he reiterated but today is to this is cool so he went to costaguana more family stuff not a kid
2084.85,2094.6, that is really cool place in the jungle and that's anneli's about kano and i was literally just got into this part of casarico on blaming bed looking at the book i did one of these deals
2096.1,2100.63, wow and i walked outside the held it out because
2100.66,2106.24, later it's never not covered with clouds of i had the moment when this thing was a coming cloud
2106.24,2107.29, you know what
2107.38,2121.15, amazing the people great the food great it's fascinating there's much it's just an amazing place but were like next to a nuclear power plant as ethel i don't think that that we be sitting there in her little in the whole hotel which angrily would stay in her
2121.15,2123.28, i don't know that i wasn't relieved the 
2123.4,2131.05, ariovistus animals in colorado and one of the reasons i hear somebody told me this looks like a diorama than his eventual history
2131.35,2132.67, i never thought
2133.18,2135.46, my mother in law and she has nice
2137.38,2139.36, a photographer you know
2142.15,2150.97, this is sometimes the issue would like all the time but i use the hasseltine find things that go like this in the house of life so you guys see this isn't where do
2151.03,2158.95, i like this in new york is like what always now i were that you know you're going to europe this is a big deal out here it's just looks like the neighborhood 
2159.01,2160.72, this is
2160.96,2166.63, this last but it's no use for and i see can't tell you wait for the thing that pacific
2166.63,2170.74, i wanted to look right and this is actually one of the i was nervous illness
2171.58,2173.89, i just want to think it funny but 
2174.76,2178.27, yet this is costigan on the road to supersede
2178.27,2182.83, that was the cause it's called touchwood let the case
2183.34,2185.29, this is the place of a man
2185.53,2190.06, this is most for my kids i think it's really funny underwear up dry
2190.06,2198.01, by the way we have like an out house and no electricity everything's run by profane so this is you know this is my walker evans comes to
2199.27,2206.32, so this one i don't alianora so this is just what goethe looking at
2206.83,2212.95, there i think it's a caravanserai in the vatican you're forced to stare the sun to see this thing
2213.13,2214.84, adonis
2215.8,2219.94, that i may be funny too i'll take funny on now and that's peru
2220.21,2222.13, where it flies actually
2222.34,2225.82, she she is the star so it may be
2225.88,2227.38, the place
2227.59,2229.33, i wondered later by the way
2229.96,2231.94, this is southern turkey and
2232.3,2241.87, again i didn't like this part in my life made me frantic and the oratorio think i like it but to me the ionian is this is actually one of my favorite pictures is that the kids were a smart one arter you can't see it
2242.29,2245.47, people think it now because of the artist that this is 
2248.44,2249.52, the
2249.88,2253.93, there's a magazine sitting here that all story about me and the illustrated with this
2254.05,2258.22, that i don't say that this is but again there's the wires all the stuff and
2259.75,2261.1, we have a neighbor
2261.25,2270.04, plastic palm trees in front of it and i never figured it out but this is like a dusting of snow and indefinite
2270.04,2281.2, again maybe i am funny i don't know this was funny to me and the movement he changed them they're not always the same patriot him different in maternity like the garage was he filled with his too
2282.1,2292.6, i play golf now because i moved to the suburbs and it was appropriate so i went and amplified and i was decently god i got down to a better ten so all right
2292.69,2315.61, for but i was up in scotland years ago and its royal door not like a dog fusille die to play now but it's i and the ingenious are possessive case the becomes how is this gate stopping anybody from seven of the one foot piece of stone that's what it is like okay i don't have a key i can't get in
2316.51,2329.47, this seems to resonate with photographers there is love his picture on knowest preserver got is the sidewind somebody said that the retainers anybody in beastlike on no real not like
2329.68,2338.59, a window a weird goose i used to i was in a golf course where my little gray takes lessons and
2339.1,2341.89, why there's waves at a water
2342.52,2345.34, in long and we have waithmanite
2345.37,2346.99, apparently plastic
2347.17,2354.28, mammals scarce so they put these things out again i don't believe it gayathitha looked funny
2354.28,2363.1, it was actually a different kind of picture the guainares you have to point this because you don't have anything to the window thing like the life in bidasari
2364.81,2371.11, so last summer i decided i had been shooting anything so i saw oscar shooting more de street which i did when i was let
2371.14,2372.91, in complete
2373.12,2374.8, anything over years ago
2374.83,2376.69, so i said she street
2376.84,2384.46, the sort of great thing that happened was i started shooting last may or june i got how much of good stuff and the curate a resume it in new york
2384.64,2391.03, some through face which is a great promotion device for me and said we're doing a shell in streets shouting that we want to use a much of your stuff
2391.42,2409.45, then they sent up a calabrese very special that you can't amaranthe put in for my pictures from really nice gammy on wall and the minute i got to the opening as you got to see what i did for you too and he's the greatest gusterson osseous for years now and the musicians beautiful thing and he put it on the wall and 
2409.54,2417.91, and this i just started doing it a recently so for me the sort of an old of course this is from a man aristodemus by my office in the city
2418.81,2424.87, there's a whole boy in there by the sort of the way so i get out later but when i walk by the first thing he was like a little boy and the suit case
2426.67,2432.28, at this i said this a i don't say it like street but my son actually have a better one
2432.4,2435.07, he put this mess with the monopoly man mask
2435.19,2450.79, he's walking down the street actually it's not the seisachtheia ly i said stop and he stood it like this going or you know you're doing this again and then these two this woman on the left was i can tell us he did canteenair but that's on sorting
2451.51,2459.34, so this is in rome in a problem went to italy everything was beautiful nothing was ironic nothing was weird everything was just awesome
2459.43,2461.83, like beautiful just tolerance
2461.95,2466.18, i regret that i went to paris to wish i'd moved a wrong but i moved to pass
2466.51,2468.94, french noisette idly on
2468.97,2476.44, on a way to the airport i asked if i could sit in the front seat on the outside and on one import i saw this none of the road i
2476.5,2486.67, wonder is it something i'm trying to set my camerons really low wit and i think it just that the exposed to that cloth and i have a chance and i really like it my wife does not like this one that
2487.0,2488.35, it bore
2489.04,2493.6, this is recently and somebody said they would like morandot
2493.75,2501.19, i just wanted to picture angelina joy actually a lot of the street i do now i don't look through the camera but i kinder time nowhere it is
2501.19,2503.32, people say that really is true
2503.65,2504.7, i really do

2633.7,2642.64, and you know the guy's going through capital growth for a really good meal and his pistol like italian you got his aggressor angry
2643.39,2645.67, i like this one for a lot of reasons so
2645.85,2650.44, with the world wrestling federation whatever it's called so is the woman whom it
2650.44,2653.38, and she was running for the governor senator from connecticut

2679.39,2681.82, this could be in europe
2682.36,2685.0, this is also in the show and
2685.21,2701.98, this underseas of a church there was about to be a wedding and i just knew you know when you get that man history know when you know something is going on but you don't know what's going on in your feeling i got to be somewhere near this i always say you know you can't force a picture but you certainly give yourself pretty some in a position where it might happen
2702.19,2711.13, i remember running up the steps and almost killing myself doing this some going on the way these people are all and i tokubei love this one and lifelike but and i let him just the teleport of his head either
2711.19,2714.07, the people who remember the little rascals everybody over like
2715.54,2717.43, some of the parking lot
2717.49,2718.81, more
2718.84,2722.26, and this woman was working around with this baby
2722.71,2728.59, i took a picture i don't believe it's a real baby by the late do not fall on me
2729.31,2731.05, this is the end
2731.11,2733.9, and you know the joke at least one show business
2734.08,2737.2, now take that it
2738.28,2756.34, i made this for me and any did that man thank you aesayatyenenghdon
2757.12,2759.31, he is pre
2760.3,2762.07, about
2763.9,2769.48, no that was my beautiful now that was the beauty of rome you know i think what was ironic was
2769.75,2783.91, but we're we're getting esterote place there was like righteous great a group i think they are franconnette it and hernani think they saw the idea of her and the other ones like i don't know i don't really know actually the turns
2784.0,2802.96, i know that in shooting something i mean i think if a lot of it especially in the street no one solemn but really i and even now after a hundred of years ago in this when the contact sheepscote back i swear it so exciting when i get one i just got one the other day and i like dignitaries
2803.8,2806.38, i don't fear them i never goin to be another picture
2806.47,2808.36, always surprised when i do
2808.36,2814.81, i guess it's a confidence in but it genuinely always like a relief almost that i got one that i liked because
2815.2,2818.38, can stop right i mean cordials
2818.8,2821.41, he started painting again
2821.56,2822.97, if there's 
2826.75,2827.89, he
2827.92,2830.29, she digitally for work
2830.77,2841.84, and when should filomel but on this trip for the first time in bringing so many gave me a camera with his nice lands one of their little cameras and reticule with it so i do she called sometimes for the little digital can
2842.83,2852.85, so the caller i still don't get the black and white thing with digital need the grain you know dinosaurian set but i don't care and i like the book i actually think
2853.54,2862.18, we asked me an interesting question she said with her three best and horses about the time we today i think digital tisane of us thinks it's great
2862.63,2866.65, so because certain things happens when you take a picture tiny
2866.95,2870.64, you expectation just seen it it's not your expectations to but
2871.09,2874.48, i think waiting three weeks and inspection i had is now gone
2874.48,2877.12, something that may be i got wrong can be right
2877.24,2881.23, people as a lot of stuff digitally because they're like this is one i wanted his 
2881.26,2887.68, you don't have the choice of film it's going to come i found pictures that i took in the nineties not upstanding stuff to put our face work
2887.95,2890.86, it finishes and if it was digital i know it would 
2891.28,2893.41, i think digitalis an issue i think
2893.44,2899.14, you can see what you did right away i get it with parnassia fun we loved it but that was never
2899.5,2903.31, the way to take pictures like think you needed to let i think so three weeks really helps
2906.43,2914.29, so i really sitting like there's nothing more to adoration crop
2914.59,2926.05, you know it's weird whose outside now in pentameter for another the interviewed me and she got it in he knew the more you interviewed by people the more even think about what you're doing i think it's actually a good process
2926.05,2928.78, on the radio because they hear yourself and that's a nightmare
2930.1,2933.7, especially when the chop it up and make it said were not i don't mean to be on the radio
2933.88,2940.48, you are thinking about what you do and i students privately that for a while and then cropped and we croisades i think
2940.78,2947.86, a picture not go you know what this is what i think you are looking at an protection and i see them getting better through that process
2947.92,2949.57, at this point in my life 
2950.29,2956.8, aaron of my books has cropped because there was an issue at the corner of a headland we put a flame round and its crop but
2957.49,2961.27, i think now if i miss one so i have a bunch it's like i have money in the bank
2961.3,2973.75, some weird way i don't need to do that and i can't learn any more i mean i can learn but i'm no goin to learn cropping my picters what i meant to do i can see when i screwed about and that's why i have pictured it a good that i won't keep because they don't hit with the other one
2974.02,2976.51, kind of a weird thing i think one day may be
2976.93,2986.2, then of course the truth is one something what it's like but i mean i have pictures like that i don't plateaus they don't fit in with the rest and i know to do with him
2986.59,3002.13, which is some like the about you can calling alike the attar this again that i need like to him you know the original plan when i was in at school with a couple of my friends as we get one good picture every year when were fifty will have a book and logically it makes sense you know like and i said that was the plan
3002.16,3010.23, the first book before that and i don't mean the sestian enough for them now that if i want to make another book and it's sort of cool
3010.23,3013.08, that this sort of went out the window but i still believe that like
3013.2,3016.08, at percent you're behind him
3016.38,3022.95, said the chief you on the busy off the bus if i have any gadabout a picture it doesn't make sense to me i don't want it i can't
3022.98,3024.87, it's not worth it anyway this point
3025.53,3029.82, this opened a way she does not
3029.85,3031.98, it solon
3032.73,3039.3, okay so the first book came out and it was a disaster they ship three hundred museum carriers that was great
3039.75,3043.41, we didn't limit addition with gallery owner
3043.8,3053.64, a great guy said don't take a good picture don't take what he respects it does well in something a sort of not that great then you'll do etudiants the stupidest thing i select one
3053.79,3061.23, and it's because i didn't go into my own instinct which was to yourself to me are so many did was for the next book i got little ensample
3062.31,3063.54, nothing to do with it
3063.84,3065.79, the door
3065.91,3071.88, so looks i'm not like what you need to eat but i'm not it makes a lot of money in cellars
3072.03,3075.96, so i went to my own i said i think i can pull this off i'll get the same people
3076.05,3083.1, the same way and i make a limited additional calberte book comes out and i can limit edition with the prince to rafters of the puranapore
3083.22,3089.52, literally as soon as my cousin had not gone faces that this great market self whatever was
3090.06,3092.46, in the first place we
3092.85,3114.03, he had like all this money in lines as this easy and i literally and then for two endless missus restaurant with some friends who was for a north where like idiots and there the other people there they felt badly they were yelling and stuff i said let us pay for our meal with a jerk and she goes she was german a waldenian teaches on the on the board of the
3114.36,3117.36, was the place called the national arts club
3117.57,3121.02, she said poor place and talk about your photography or whatever i might really
3121.11,3131.46, she goes on she said what are you doing aisthesin emailed her she ended on the two sisters on your work come speak and his men imbuing at a year or one month let's do that
3131.7,3133.89, so like in his present
3134.28,3137.94, a bunch of money had this book signing when crazy on face book
3138.12,3146.37, trick by one can't do now i started finding everybody who liked leyland gathering lidarwat i started framing the micrad
3146.46,3152.43, can't do that now they're like somehow it's different and i got like a people i focused on new york twice late
3152.55,3157.53, books and so we did the same range there were at this time
3157.53,3160.05, and they said i know i got scared
3160.08,3162.75, the very famous photographer that a book signing
3162.84,3166.41, this place my friend said to me you know i went to a like people that
3167.04,3168.27, as
3168.27,3170.22, really like husbands
3170.22,3179.22, i'm screwed that's no way and was coming to my time we got a hundred people there and i think the five ranleigh there so we seen the pre thing and that book is like
3179.25,3187.56, the publisher this is ridiculous i learned how to do and on the first one i went on press wadawasee and so now agreed with joe
3187.68,3190.02, he's actually that's what he does
3190.26,3195.27, and the last two persons and they were both in the black before they were out
3195.84,3201.66, business was that there you don't have to give a publisher twenty five thousand dollars and take your book anymore
3201.99,3214.05, one man that's my only i have a lot of pains about that but you got to be involved and it takes a lot of it you know it's a project with a personal interpersonal desire and you got and you're all i want to care
3214.11,3215.19, the honest
3215.19,3222.42, press does not care what your book looks like the publisher i don't care what they say you don't care the care look at her there investment back
3222.45,3224.58, nothing because they make you pay for everything
3224.58,3228.03, so that's the real that's why i get myself
3229.86,3231.24, something
3232.29,3236.82, for we gothically anybody else
3236.97,3241.74, well thanks for coming in like that i filled the house is really good
3242.28,3247.23, nearer
