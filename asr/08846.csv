24.9,34.95, to night well looking at the science behind the news in our next informant of these signs behind the headlines supported by inspiring australia
34.95,134.88, the side transcience media center and of course are is to remember that to night we are live streaming this particular event so you will actually be able to follow on the discussion whether you are in the audience here or if you're at home by following twitter or the chaperon if you are going to use tideless perhaps or i as and drugs in sport to night were discussing a sign behind the recent revelations of drug taking but now seems to be endemic across all sports in january this year lancastrian sat down with orenian in five years he admitted to cheating doping lying bullying and for his confession contrasts through cycling then sport more generally with accusations of doping are in other sports starting to trickle forth in february this year the australian crime commission released a report into australian sport indicating among other things that drunken was taking place in australian sport and by australian athletes this controversy is the biggest strike up in sport in australia since the introduction of one day cricket both fell and in leagues of reeling from the publicity of their highly suspicious supplement regimes that have prompted some teams to go into damage control essential club has sacked sport scientists and the cromlechs have sat every one including the coach although he subsequently been re hired to night we are asked what the athletes taking
134.94,149.22, the effects anecdote to stop it further what do we testing for and how are we doing it finally perhaps most controversially why is taking a pill considered cheating at all
149.25,185.73, all being questions to consider him to help me to do that to night i like to introduce my panel doctor all exercise physiology and head of the school at human movement studies at charles stuivers professor robert robes the registered presisted physiologist rosycross omits to say but while i was satirised psychologist senectute the university of new south wales and editor in chief of the scientific journal performance in hansen and health doctor jason mazaroff
185.79,224.31, and there from the meteor the australian side media center and a cadence give my panel a big round of a poor and i can hear so here also be aware that those of you in the audience here is your watching these clips there will be some blank spots in clips where we couldn't get licensing for those particular shops of these cliffs without further curlike a play the first of those clipstone this is an interview with tiahuana lessels from the seven thirty reports completed one
231.96,246.27, let's stop with let's go back to opar interview with motorman in both cases these athletes had been taking potest of grown and had been doubled doing so robert
246.48,251.49, doing what is a what is the test atradates blood tiding
251.64,257.31, that's just it just go back just one step right if you only the
257.34,269.25, you involved in a contest for a you're involved in a sport that's kind of clock by distance or speed no paris anything and for another pair as how rapidly you can generate force
269.25,270.9, contracting muscles
271.08,278.85, we can look at sport and that was in the context that well if you're looking at a very explosive tie by its like in a context ports
278.88,280.65, a muscle bulk
280.95,304.02, to poisoning endurance lighted board you looking at the ability of muscle to generate power repeatedly over time for pulling periods of time so i fell like up the muscles size connection he talking about annalissis attest astern in the growth woman and now to day with have analogues that improve the bodies response to a given amount of indulging or within the body
304.05,314.58, and obliterate talking about in an aborigine can now actually mimic some of these women and that was to release by the ass report
314.94,348.84, inside he is a revelation for a return polani aforesaid the size in the kidney is specialized cells and its ralestones redwood so production in every pardon is potentially dangerous and they have been abolitioner the years for amusing apologising has been around for the thirty forty years it been woken in the cycling fraternity that's renewed blood removed from the body anywhere from half a wideleaved then several weeks later i once the bodies recovered from their blood lass and i have no oblivion again and no more rebosos
348.9,349.92, the
350.25,354.93, melicent the body and raises rinbod cell
354.96,392.55, content and the ability to transport oxygen to the working muscles and that enables them to have more power for pamperos of time so and there all very very effective as has been established by by research olesha that with blood doing now cause parts of calves blood is this true well i go transpire i guess there's been some rumors and ever and adoration that that that hasn't been really research but so that wherever that year there are some components of mentality can also provide some benefit on the anabolic side
392.64,400.71, all right so cannot save thee there is a definitely a benefit of taking these things
400.71,405.18, he
405.9,420.24, the question about whether or not performance of handing drugs are actually performance enhancing is actually a lot more vexed than we think and so if for example look at their fine specimen you have here an outlet as that lattimore great academic 
420.69,425.37, you let me up on human ritualised i'm not going to go on when a medal
425.79,446.73, we have to remember that it is not the baron and a performance there is a paper which came out of the international journal droghling just yesterday which is a linieres on about what effect has opened on the times in the hundred matutinal of the olympics the men's final the famous nineteen eighty eight race being the starting point
447.0,450.96, there is absolutely no effect for doing
451.02,455.34, i haven't been able to find on the other could be sampling problems in their night by night that
455.37,461.61, aleshine is that the changing in running time over the period in question
461.73,483.33, as would be expected irrespective of whether you introduce anti doping laws or anything which either means that the drugs were there or there there actually having no effect in the conclusion that the drawer is that the drugs that are being used for the hundred battestina in iambic ducally have a noggen effect so well with patches while they been at being taken
483.99,488.73, as a psychologist i love to say that it's because athletes feel that they need to
488.82,509.37, no question that these drugs do have some kind of impact if you think about the tancredi long rights and if you get a really minute the centering cruise over that entire race one per cent could be titillated so they don't have some effect it's just not as big as we might think it is but when you're talking about it later the margins are so small
509.4,512.28, even this tiny margins can make a big difference
512.88,519.72, i got a comment there so anybody who was watching lancastrian though during his reign and the tolerance
519.87,529.11, theologists would have said this is just unbelievable so when you get the athletes and you take them up and have them compete against each other
529.11,539.76, physiology doesn't explain performance i things like psychology does but absolutely recovery and lothe respects can really better explain performance between eliot
540.18,541.71, then when you get
541.83,559.62, and on being all that he was on there are the times in the races and remembered the way the the time when he got thrown off his wide by his hand a barking on to her hand bag or something and he got left behind and he is pulled up and the head of that degree of separation
559.62,564.06, the end of an athlete sky just speak of
564.21,572.82, nation so you were on to land is ago whereas i was quietly till i met you in that this is too good to be true
572.85,584.46, i was just amazed how little conversation was going on at that time for how the physiology difference there was there was so statutory talked about
584.61,598.29, probably because no one wanted to believe that so many people were taken aback by what lacedaemonians remit was treason could be seven totanes and then to come out and say blacking
598.32,606.99, a lot of people have lost the hero the mountain the austrasians media center of in your main roll is to
607.41,613.29, is to gorleston list to sides when the whole
613.29,624.03, the crime commission report came out about blood diving and the lancinating blew up at the beginning of the year arise
624.66,635.97, had the deceased was there much traffic world was anybody interested in the last now and i basely because by then it was more about the man it wasn't the drug it wasn't what he done it was
636.21,641.61, it was you know the opera into view and you know we all entered amazement of all his responses and i
641.88,686.04, admissions that there wasn't really exist that stage like there was no question that ever an wanted to know what he'd been doing but they didn't want to know what that was exactly it was more about having done it is going to admit it and in the process whoring it so for in january we now during the opinionated get anything basically and then but for the atabapo we got we reacted to it we hadn't had a very many questions about but we thought will i be we should be putting ulster and just setting a field the record strikes there are few issues out there about the use of the now pepin those things sort of arose so we felt we had to jump him then and that wasn't on the back of any one asking us but we figured it was probation that we
686.52,695.73, have got a few people at the counter as each take these drugs take to test our they distractions
696.15,709.89, that's fine you lend a sort intrusted doping of course that would be a candle or wallensteins
710.25,712.68, because these things are normal
712.74,723.42, parson the boshman system what's the detection raging widened old days thirty or more years ago the
723.66,731.25, tetragrammaton with from animals so the different structure to the human type so they are relatively easier to detect
731.43,745.29, nowadays with these antibodies that are out there is a bit more difficult although the different than what's really a curing and the human body so they catherine but the response is
745.29,762.72, so if you're looking at masculine looking at with reporting at red blood so mass like material was talking about they look for out of range ralestone human variation that end on certain so you can have some one probably taking these things
762.72,773.16, stainton that put him upon the high end but it can be acceptable so you'd actually oriegon or be more of a promising but testamento track someone over time
773.19,787.98, see if the system elevates into toleration just naturally endowed with a large estortuaire my delight that for example the improved the bodies response secretions of the romans
788.01,792.9, you have the book for these models but see in human vicinity
792.93,807.99, what's called a half life so the body metabolizes and break these down and so there's an certain time frame wearily more confidently look at whether or not these substances that would have been taken there that that bright down time
808.08,816.75, tallantire to them as blow times and apparently he said that he wouldn't have been able to have got through
816.78,846.96, hundreds of drum tests if he didn't have a good time of scientist telling him when he was blowing and when he was clean and natterally manage his drug can i talk to her a bit allahabad that work be you can actually manage someone to drug raging sound the testing can't talk a lot about a one as researches when a letter research to stop because it's unethical and shall the researches are in alabastron the people who do
847.11,880.29, in terms of the time frames that that's a bit of a problem being a research milosch for subject of research that having to withington orator at the athletes who do it and try and fix them out and then try and desertin some of these details but you know who doesn't like to give a lot of information i mean a lot of the stuff is pretty secret than one of the people nor abates tom frames and so the people who might be taking it in abusing it finally out from calandrino gets out in the allatoona
880.35,888.06, but the very much substance specific and certainly you're right it's a well established will rest
888.12,900.93, pretty well estated series of events that leaflets gatepost jason to questions you can choose which one you like to answer how would you go about detecting drums in a sportsman
900.93,906.09, if you will touch how'd you go about making it so that then not detected
907.62,911.55, good questions
911.64,920.37, the first one well how jettatore would you put in place to trumpet drum cheeks in sport
920.94,925.8, look my answer to this is going to be horrendous of those
926.04,934.59, problem is that the heat performance managers are yes you've got a drug regime for athletes at the late level
934.77,942.45, the question becomes legality and illegality which can change caffeine used to be banned now it's not
942.51,950.58, the question and becomes as a high performance manager of sport my question is how do i risk manage this issue
950.97,954.75, not all know or contributes its bad no
954.99,960.81, look at this in terms of pure business i have to think about what other teams might be doing
960.99,971.82, and then how to respond to that now i think they're going to get corioli think they're going to get caught the ashtray stay claim because then all be the victor because thou be taken out of the competition
972.3,981.66, talk about a manager is actually a very different question because they're going to be looking and we say it with her and the claims now that the coming out
981.66,987.03, i want to sail close to the wind because that's where performance advantage lies that were competitive advantage lies
987.12,1006.44, sport is business at the end of the market a cat's not this romanticized hellenic idealized now people doing it for virtuous reasons and noble reasons a volocity complete big business of there now they're going to do what they need to do to make sure that this sport is more attractive it's faster it stronger than another sport
1006.47,1015.89, you look at side the competing with the r how do they get market share we have to make out a game better and harder and faster when you do that you put pressure on the flats
1015.95,1019.94, people have to go in we out week in week out and produce
1020.09,1022.4, have a little tongue
1022.58,1029.87, got a start looking at how do i get back on the field so professional cycles for example forgotton the bark if i'm not racing i'm not getting money
1029.87,1042.53, to get back on the back as fast as i can as talking to a guy malvano with this problem and his body broke because he was trying to maintain a training regime to be competitive with other cyclists some of whom were divination do it
1042.86,1046.79, if you ask me then how to withdraw and drug proof
1047.06,1052.13, in my answer stop coming back as fundamentally alter sport
1052.22,1065.75, actually stop looking at how you structure a sport so the athletes don't have to take drugs to survive so things like have shoreless don't have is intensive have more time between intention if you want to run them
1065.78,1076.64, force for example as swimmers to guide from event to event to event in the lad up to the role championship may be have them have fewer vents then when i get to the well chanoine them in a couple of months of
1076.64,1081.71, let them recover i mean you say the gods are come of the touranian people
1081.92,1106.64, really i give them the time of lettice back naturally so they did made to use a and b extend so to help that recovery period and to national farreaching answer then i was expecting her i feel it i asked the time and sanitarians made but that grandemont so i next clear this is stephen thank former salampore scientist
1106.67,1114.29, after being asked about the nature of support that he brought in to the flies what stephen bank had to say
1123.14,1135.41, but that speaks directly to what you were just saying that you the pressures in sport or so much these days that it's not hasten managing the drugs at managing the sport that needs to be addressed
1135.98,1149.81, that's that that's been but like the guys are in senator they take the hat wasn't and testudinata vitamins and at times
1150.92,1157.88, well first of all the aces report is an intelligence exercise we don't know the facts
1157.94,1159.71, the stores
1159.74,1170.06, but that if you listen to that full interview there's supposition that there anaesthesia blood
1170.12,1172.79, and then certainly biblemen ation
1172.88,1175.31, and that kind of
1175.4,1194.36, i mean the main address verbally has been at namely botheration whatsover things involved as just really hard to come in too much on this with that more evidence and assad and jonas to get to that evidence and then released it which i think will agree is becoming a very sorrow
1194.36,1196.79, to right now
1197.09,1223.94, yet unclassified was but no it was a marchioness medium management the way that it was dealt with because you know following on from what your saying a large part of this is driven by the whole gambling thing her industry that sprung up around sport and so what do they do they have a report they released they say what was it six teams in the onrespect ed were not going to tell you which one
1224.03,1236.96, opening a book as to which six today were that way were make some money on the side let's hand but coming back to a point i made earlier about managing
1237.2,1262.46, other people are doing glance on from said something very interesting that at the time when when our asked him if taking band substances which cheating he said appetite now the definition of cheating is to gain an advantage on a rival or to they don't have i didn't you at that way i viewed it in this case i was talking about doing as creating a level playing field
1263.69,1274.79, masterful piece of mental arithmetic to the woods not toting always kids but two wrongs make a right he would be but to the play on to one you were saying about
1275.06,1284.72, that is everybody else doing what is a competitive advantage i found put this up in some of the stuff i do online
1284.75,1288.53, we have actually gone through and actually analyzed
1288.59,1290.75, as in question
1291.29,1304.94, they just didn't do it now this is where i stop being suspicious this was about land i mean the french of heaven in for armstrong for a long time and goodness knows that travestied and lancastrian so travestied being the head of the u s antidoting agency
1304.94,1315.2, they really don't like each other as you can tell where some of the flying lawsuits they've threatened at each other this was about what this was not necessarily about doping in cycling
1315.41,1327.95, if they are serious about it they would go through and they would analyze all of those samples they would go back and they would do the same non analytic investigative job and they would find the first claim winner
1328.31,1333.92, no wonder the legitimacy of that if the first claim were as the seventh placed side
1334.16,1342.47, gowen we talk about the level playing field i mean this notion that sport is somehow about being fair is not
1342.62,1347.3, really is sport is a discriminatory activity just like education
1347.33,1354.14, we are here to sort out the winners from the losers and the best people from people who probably should do something else
1354.53,1385.19, when it comes to this i mean you know you had from equatorial guinea came out in the olympics and the guy had never seen an olympic swimming pool before how is that fair compared to the germans of age and that's the question what entertaining i think this is really the is it sport is gone from being this wonderful victorian past time of gentlemanly honour preparing them to take over the natives and whatever colonial outpost retiring about and none
1385.4,1393.8, i moved into this thing or it's not about fair it's all about what you can produce at a paper will watch it you can sell advertising space sponsorship
1393.8,1414.44, important thing to her i was amazed at that comment more from what didn't happen after it then really what it was about causative basinette playing field and the whole idea of competitive sport is to generate as in level a plain to it as you can wetherbe by bit of training of bitter recruitment
1414.47,1422.54, approaching a true salary cap or in some tomata exuding a cellar cap and to do that and what every possible then this is
1422.69,1434.27, line that's drawn by some extent agency and i wot that as one that's now in ethical i came now that's okay so this she is about ethics and somehow or other
1434.3,1444.92, and as a bit of a mystery we have to decide what becomes an ethical and that's really the grace because there there are many arguments you can make for some of the things going on that now
1445.07,1465.44, as was well explained by jason i mean the play his health is also really really important and i'm amazed at her little power a play a hast protect herself into the sporting arena let's see let's bring up our next term or clip with his going back here to eranthis his take on the wall
1465.5,1466.55, of
1466.55,1468.17, of cheating
1476.9,1495.26, the fray i saw him do in ninety dismissal the needle dingaan when he said i saw him doing what was epistle seeing at the time well probably i mean we let no man in these tolerances
1496.67,1503.93, effectively and to minimize the risk because tis not forget this is a strategy that is potentially live threatening if torn
1504.32,1513.74, you need a big well founded system with highly skilled and trained personnel which would mean medically trained
1513.8,1516.41, assist in this and so
1516.59,1555.74, let your mind wander i mean would they be caravans followed this alteration probably say yes i mean one of the other issues with these athletes is the dehydration and they would have to be put on intervenes sailing or fluid to the earache way the race the next day because contained the body two or three days to get over severe dehydration and these athletes are doing it day after day after day so he let you i wonder i mean it's very very easy to walk through a caravan perhaps in seemed in a cylindrical considered treating or an unfair advantage for by wider and my understanding is not
1555.74,1577.01, mary you that these guys can actually rationalize away cheating quite so the best to canoeing sport person i play it and i watch it and especially the air falstaff which is a big costantino last milestone and is the idea that
1577.43,1585.62, sport is almost like sport catfishes the idea that it's an andante playing full place in the fact that you played a win and unless
1585.83,1617.84, playing to win you not playing sport playing the game and that's the thames the only way you could level it at as to take away toiling to win is that really all sporters about and if if it is then you just justified doping the queen like the roll is they there are rules on but as you say if they don't mean that don't get money like the problem with this the lower end of the foscarini people the teams like parapet have so much trouble were except not of light from other have inions because they're not performing well enough so there is no use that element that unless they perform
1617.84,1622.58, get money they conceived so therefore the under twelve nipple
1622.7,1628.4, or by the not to take one but he is in the talking about sport has to be about winning
1629.27,1650.48, when it doesn't which is genius sport when it's supposed to be character development and so on so i mean let's clarify what is there a difference between a late sporting on latest that means we actually have to have different rules and at the moment antidoting is only apply at the elite level there is botherations anywhere else now this was actually a big public health issue
1650.48,1665.45, take down to the bottom in and the cycling australia review by justice would say look believe whatever let's get into club syene's get into where it actually matters down the bottom this romorantin continue on salading it shading
1665.87,1677.93, the really annoys me with the drug chest it sensation arising in issue and it avoids the man issue we are talking about people who feel that they have to take drugs to do the job
1678.38,1700.19, to call them cheat is to somehow say that i came of these people are wrong you demanding this is what happened the lancastrian we smashed in because we put him up on a moral pedestal and then we were disappointed to find out that what we demanded he do as consumers all of a sudden the vile comes back and we got holy cracked that's what you have to do to win the tool
1700.7,1717.2, that to me we've got a start looking at it and saying this is more than just about who wins and interesting that we didn't smash arsames drunk for to generosity in order to be cancer but would take drugs in a different setting that's when it becomes problematic and
1717.89,1735.32, actually reading it that perhaps we should take the attitude of drugs and sport should be allowed providentially regulated and managed my position was his annoys has been that drugs need to be controlled in sport i reject the latiaris is the problem with the whole debate
1735.65,1748.49, someone who comes out and says i disagree with anti doing and then i get black ball but pretty much every one up and down the food chain as some one whose for drugs i am fooling everyone newsies
1748.67,1755.12, the question that when i sat down at a good long hard look at myself and i had a look at my infant son and i said
1755.36,1793.07, i want him to grow up in a system where he has to use drugs now and i hope to god that he doesn't show any promises in a late apple but if he does i'm incredibly well equipped to manage that process now and if he is going to have to use drugs to get through his career and come out at the end of it being able to walk not having his brains smashed in through multiple concussions i want him to use those drugs and i want him to use those drugs in a way which is going to mean that he had sustained healthy life for normal lifespan of goose lancastrian tarlaton they don't look like sick men to me i hope i look back good when i'm there i
1793.16,1812.36, i do politeness of context to isabeau you know if your son was to go on to rock and roll mean keeps recharter would be without tropical as go sebastopol happen to the raven i mean really to side of that 
1812.57,1827.0, there are many exercises physiologists who have fascinated by pushing human performance limits so if we we if we do that and we say let's really try and make men and women before to their
1827.18,1830.36, extreme best that is of itself
1830.48,1833.24, to the risk of the competition
1833.66,1846.89, we get bigger and bigger big a man playing repleta it becomes the more dangerous and are dangerous in more dangerous arena and he can apply that to a evenemens on of sport you want you are look at if you make cycles
1846.89,1851.15, faster momentum is physics of the crash
1851.24,1854.39, the more severely so
1854.45,1865.4, the just the caesarean and its complete i mean i don't have the answer i mean i don't have an answer but it's just that if you push the limits
1865.97,1867.71, get more dangerous
1867.95,1881.27, say wouldn't necessarily follow jason's well i think jason other advice was was the key issue but that's up with money i mean we need to manage sport and that the athletes considered more and if
1881.33,1905.78, more games to a season in a football corridor adding more consecutive days of competing in any other event is more and more risky and demands that they do have to take supplement to survive finish maybe bitter word that event and that's just like jason said i pushing them to have to do it so that sports management in a world now with sports his dolls and olympic as those and when we
1905.78,1923.81, look at how many golden medals country god was as another country after the impinging the straw just complained to hackettstown as many gold medals i mean commanded this really an endemic situation and ingestion the head i mean how we goin to regulate sport to be protected from that
1923.9,1925.61, complex to
1926.0,1948.11, exciting discussions ladies and gentlemen it is time to go to the intermission in fact i'm getting a hurry up now because i hardly run over over time we're going to take a brief ten minute in fact no will take a full ten minutes intermission and but before we do that could you please give a big round of applause to our free speakers seven
