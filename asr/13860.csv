1.02,14.28, all right ah sustain ability urban configurations i'm also as an educator i interested in conceptual art as a minimalist practice so we looking at here is paper pile at the university of chicago
14.43,23.46, where intercepting the paper collection over a two month period the paper pile began to grow so not really
23.46,32.34, using it as an intervention space but also allowing the edge the space of education or the fewer to see the accumulation of shredded paper
32.34,33.87, institution
34.02,50.55, and so what was kind of interesting is that at the end of the paper pile is that i actually kind of overtook the galleries space and people could not enter and that was one of the kind of the living legacies if you will because it became a living painting not only by because we did not
50.88,53.13, lay the paper down ourselves we just
53.43,101.31, employed the sanitation people to do it and so it was kind of like we were just kind of intercepting the gallery became like the dump and the view became more educated by that also at the university of chicago what was interesting as that they had an amazing collection of herman miller chairs and but they could not sell them but they allowed the use of kind of reinterpretation of what these objects were and so as an artist as a sculptor interested in kind of ideas of green as the snail or wurranunnah so you know what can i say
101.37,122.82, the next age come yeah speaking of living painting so cutting a hole in a gallery wall the museum hated it but that's okay you know so this becomes a living painting because it left up over a period of four months and there we see a lot
122.82,125.25, october trees all the way through
125.25,176.37, in an office but also making the galleries based not a gallery but more as a kind of an urban space for other people is offering a free internet service to people who might just be walking by his kind of a socially based practice the really bad picture of me but that's okay so everything there is rented everything there is kind of goetterdaemmerung as measles just that kind of trade night
176.37,178.98, on that i didn't know that 
179.13,218.1, so everything is paper everything that's kind of suspended and kind of an illusion so here again is kind of ideas of the city is of the city also kind of expend to recollections
218.49,237.45, other artists michael manicaland boatman it's a lighting piece that major league baseball did not want but that's okay you know it's art so they have to get it anyway and so white
237.69,287.67, bottles yes and so working with a distributor in kansas city missouri to recompose his but the idea of the piece is a faculty et cetera et cetera the kind of more coming more to architecture you know my dream job is implementing being selected as an artist to work on a project were the architects educating of the building ototachibana of making
287.73,290.28, also along the lines of
290.4,319.8, ability of horrible word over us but i'm trying to kind of grass a new look aulaires convention center is was dear old everything was kind of torn down easier if you will but these beams that are floating within the space where the original beings that were holding up the warehouse so the whole work is about threescore
319.92,331.92, a very nice close up isn't that nice ah so actually disclosed in that these trees glow in the dark and so also being short listed
331.95,388.02, as a design to artist which is kind of a moral west coast phenomena that it is an atlanta phenomena i realize is that the architect said you know i'm really busy let's just do something really quick and easy and is like oh so you're not really you don't have time that's great because i'll take over as everything you see here from the shelter to the kind of these kind of landrecy lasciviousness
388.23,394.23, a kind of needs a little more artist help here so
394.23,398.76, down on the piece at night it's a living piece of course
398.82,400.68, and the
400.86,408.48, as recycled class all found outside because it was a city to sparkles very beautiful 
409.53,415.92, i
