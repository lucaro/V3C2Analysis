919.02,922.8, locked into only what's happening now
923.22,927.84, we can no longer see or hear or send anything else
928.47,940.77, nothing is important except for what were angry about and i were with somebody whose angry you may notice that you is even impossible to kind of get their attention

1201.38,1206.84, and remember why you are angry
1219.71,1231.98, some people are so disconnected from the emotion of anger that they might only be with a connect with the emotion of frustration
1234.56,1238.67, now being very frustrating timanthes consists
1238.94,1251.03, the negative in condonation suggest the anger rises when a reaction to the experience is one of fear
1251.72,1260.78, so in this situation right teanie both fearful that we're not going to be able to make a good video that the video is going to turn out terrible
1260.84,1273.56, when you reflect on your experience your memory of anger was that true for you was your reaction to the experience one of fear
1275.33,1297.77, did your anger happen in reaction to the experience of fear no perhaps you felt that somebody had taken advantage of you perhaps you felt the situation put you at a disadvantage so you know for example this situation right now timing an a major avantage to the went sirona

1455.12,1474.89, a defense mechanism to deter the abuse and humiliation i try to avoid my own feelings of being fragile and exposed a we're going to find our at this posture 
1476.99,1480.47, member going to come into
1480.86,1482.96, those
1484.64,1485.87, he
1486.17,1491.9, going to come to the top of your mind
1496.16,1498.92, in gonnelieu
1500.36,1508.25, ford and you're going to step back into doating dog
1509.3,1510.17, and
1518.24,1568.52, he lowered down on their knees or just going to set up dolphin a little but i was thinking of using our blocks for this because one thing that's really good in dolphin is to keep her all bows in your wrist equal distance apart if you can hug the block in that's a good way to keep your elbows from splaying out so from here her going to continue to kind of connect with those sensations of the feeling a little bit more fragile rather than feeling hindoostan and stable like you know when we're angry were connecting with those really were kind of stance with our strength rather than connecting with her vulnerability and our fragility so
1569.66,1586.01, by coming into these poses that might be a little bit more challenging for our i'm hoping for us to connect with are more vulnerable and produced so holding on to the block with your elbows you're going to tuck your toes under and
1586.43,1600.98, now i remember what this wasn't great kind of in the labor you know come back up into dolphin he could maybe we'll drop that once you could drop that
1601.37,1604.73, you can
1614.42,1617.12, he
1628.7,1634.04, then they're going to slowly lower down
1634.28,1644.39, and come in to child's pose for a rest here and if tiltometers unethical always lie on your back with your knees to your chest
1645.47,1651.35, so when i reflect on the time that i am angry with
1651.56,1660.14, her people or with the situations that i find myself in if i'm absolutely honest with itself
1660.35,1675.5, very often it's because i'm feeling weak and afraid however it's easier to express my anger than it is to acknowledge that i'm feeling weak
1676.1,1677.39, fearful
1677.84,1679.19, vulnerable
1682.88,1690.95, so instead of acknowledging that i am feeling weak and fearful and vulnerable i put myself out
1691.13,1697.64, appear to say strong and confident by expressing anger
1697.7,1716.45, but in truth my anger is a rising in response to an externally perceived threat especially when some other person or situation appears to possess a power that i feel i am lacking
1717.41,1722.39, appears to be taking away power that i feel i should hold
1730.16,1743.93, we're going to come back up and we're going to come into playing post now so if you have any issues with your wrist you can take plain poe's on your four arms in going to do it up
1743.93,1752.06, on my hands or i but also do it on your this never work best for you in your body
1752.51,1757.1, okay so from here going to take your left leg to the back of a man
1758.0,1806.33, as base in radiation about this last week why we face the all creases in word and it's so that the shoulders are in their strongest position of the linemen and that was something that i was taught years ago in my plays training in shoulder had course now if that doesn't feel right in your body then you are your own best teacher but that was in a amore on shoulder girdle rehab so that's what i would recommend and if you're having issues with it that is probably good idea to get it checked out by a physiotherapy pattering
1806.69,1808.82, we're goin to hold a year
1819.8,1842.51, and then you're going to tap your hips to one side and left intelectual tap
1844.49,1847.58, he
1855.35,1858.65, he
1860.18,1873.74, the london and the buccaneers for a rest to my intention there was to laitances strength in the
1874.46,1884.24, playing pose and then find some of that kind of risk and insecurity in the twisting plant post
1884.24,1889.43, so if this bother you need take needs to test on your back
1891.17,1918.5, anger instead of discussing my feelings openly and honestly angers kind of an easy way out i hold on to myself image and as strong and as a confident person and then i express anger because to admit my feelings and would be to expose my insecurity
1918.83,1960.05, and to admit my feelings could be embarrassing so rather than risking the possibility of disrespect i rise up in anger and even though i might not express this anger to another person this air can also go on very much in an internal way and there can be an actual atomic war in progress internally so you know even if you think well i'm not a very angry person a lot of times the anger can be going on in a very internal way
1961.85,1984.8, are going to come back to playing take care left leg to the back of your mind take your right leg to the bacon your mind and what we're going to do were going to tucker to table and under and we're going to open up the road chest and come into upward facing dog

2031.51,2041.17, i only exist because it is kept locked in an emotional high security vault designed to preserve self image
2041.32,2044.74, is a sense of personal security
2063.16,2067.48, i come up to see the

2311.32,2315.94, and folded forward over air right leg
2318.82,2328.72, these teachings on anger from the paralian canadian are asking me to open to my own vulnerability
2330.25,2334.72, let go of my own fear of self disclosure
2334.81,2363.25, and i have to tell you i really didn't even want to teach this class on anger i tried to let myself off the hook on it i told him what the teachings were and i said i think i can skip this class i've already done a few classes on anger and i think it's too preachy and i think we can let this one go and he says no you have to teach so tried tried not to teach it
2364.0,2366.85, so instead of continuing with
2367.21,2369.22, habits of anger
2369.22,2383.29, cathos habits that come out of defending myself and my personal identity i am exploring the possibility of opening myself to others
2383.35,2400.93, and having the courage to admit my vulnerability like just admitting to day that this these conditions to day have been really very difficult to fill in like some of the most difficult conditions in all the years of filming that we've done
