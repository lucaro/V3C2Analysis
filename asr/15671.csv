0.03,24.72, the toleration
34.02,74.55, well the military and menetaras had a relationship that is both close and had no antagonisms in relationship the various conflicts so there have been various ways in which each party has sought to manage that relationship meant to get coverage the military and to get coverage in aticular way both because that coverage would become part of the conflict itself but would also be important obviously in sustaining political sort support and domestic support for that so historically over time we've had different forms of the relationship between the military and the media and low what we've seen in
74.88,94.35, and afghanistan there's the latest permutation of that and what every one is understood is embedded journalism in many ways i think that one of the great achievements of the iraq war from the front the military point of view both the british military and the un military because what they've been able to set up this time as a system where
94.8,98.64, photographer or camera grow
98.76,101.85, the operating with incredible freedom
102.18,103.68, constraint
103.83,112.98, within an overall structure that has really conditioned the sort of coverage that have come be produced by their work so
113.79,119.7, a majority of the purisima liar with who worked in that system of report and very little
119.76,128.7, straight on a database operating with a military unit in times of conflict on the front line or whatever
128.73,132.51, but by embedding with that military unit but
132.72,135.84, let them only a very narrow frame of view
135.87,146.34, come have so it's freely obtained but it's particularly framed and that's the great given that means that the story has been about
146.76,148.05, his
148.35,159.69, particular conduct of the war on that front line very very technical and not strategic in that sense because when you're all new front line in that narrow view
159.78,184.74, the one unit you don't have a comprehensive account of the war you couldn't possibly provide a comprehensive account of the war and i know that various photographers ticularly say those you know particularly if you go in berenice carry or out in the gulf of whatever in a very short time they were concerned that what they were doing although they were freely able to do it was simply providing kindergarten
184.89,190.38, visual account of the washing at work in a way that supported the war machine at work
192.54,226.29, the system of villagers as i said i think it's really one of the great achievements from the military point of view in terms of contemporary conflict precisely because it's given that sense of freedom and therefore removed the idea that there is somehow censorship involved even though what you're getting as a very constructed visibility of very structured way in which we are made to see something and prevented from seeing other things and if you compare that to previous
226.59,261.18, systems of managing the relationship between the military and the medium it's become much more refined because of that to go back to the gulf war in nineteen ninety ninety one that's the pool system where you get a sample of journalists or sample of camors sample of photographers selected each day or periodically to them go with military units or whatever to certain parts of both the conflict and on and then provide those images generally for the media constituency at large which of course
261.39,276.21, many of the media didn't like because of the time that talk that delay in getting the images back then making this selection they're not going control over those too things and in one account of that course because there were also
276.33,278.37, men which
278.4,304.71, military officials wanted to review the sort of coverage people concluded that actually it was taking longer to get the image from the front line through the system through the military saintship controls out to the public that was taken and then in the american civil war in the night ith century for something to actually reach the public so
305.31,364.35, the contemporary in the most contemporary period that sort of delight is unsustainable because the media are not the only people with image producing machines on the battlefield you got the soldiers themselves with digital technology you you've got the cycle enemy with digital technology so number of sources from which he could get imagery and from which he could get coverage as multiplied and then of course once that's mollie the ease and with which no that digital costigliole can be produced package circulated distributed everything happens that much quicker so you couldn't have in their context a system where you have a number of gatekeepers along the way biartey would simply be by past so therefore embassies responding directly or indirectly to those technological changes so as always you have these transformations in kind of social and political practice going hand in hand with these these changes and technological crept
365.79,393.06, the salt the sort of image that you actually get produced by these managed relationships between military immediate changes over time changes in relationship to conflict only but there are probably a couple of common strands if we think about a potful of war to carrion was the most obvious strand is the focus on the individual soldier can of the embodiment of the military in a brave and heroic figure
393.21,409.11, a pool system whether it's an embedded system whether it's the credential system in vietnam you know that's from the perspective of the soldier on the ground engaged in combat suffering or fighting in particular was
409.26,448.29, that's where there's kind of a link between the sort of visual product you get out of the mediating in those environments in the name of journalism and hollywood of course you know reflecting that an someways most obviously in you know the beginning to saving quarrel be robert capatious photographs from the delay landing in night in forty four and what gilbert visually less almost exactly the same so that sensational and loose of the soldier would be one common thread running right throughout nothing to what we seen for example in the embedded work coming out of afghanistan is exactly that is a focus on
448.47,471.69, military units the individuals the personalities the struggles they have another strand that comes in and out in different ways is of course the foison the technology of war itself and the actual fighting machines and you know you can it's pretty common to see what kind of the will to espalion that is but if you think of the gulf war in nineteen
471.78,486.99, that was a distinctive moment because we got to see the camera on the nose of the missile right up to the point of impact on the target and that's the sense of the place fisticated technologically advanced
487.02,488.49, surgical
488.61,500.88, conflict and there has come in as well in various ways and we get some of the afghanistan we get some of that in roadways
500.91,531.12, all that or what is managed in a very particular way of it of course the consequence of fighting and you know the casualties the deaths of the soldiers that as well as of the enemy and of the civilians and although there is this common sense that the media loves to show violence both in a popular sense i don't think that's true in fact most media let go out of their way not to show extreme violence except when it involves of course foreign bodies in
531.18,542.91, resistance that went on directly in heated in but in these moments of military coverage and we could have had the senate coverage where the consequence of war and is
543.12,560.4, consumes far less of the coverage occupies paterson the coverage and then a dozen the actual practice of war itself and so some of the most significant moments of conflict in a managed relationship between the military and the media are over the coverage of casualties and the coverage of death
561.27,619.17, so the sort of view that gets produced out of the embrace system is one that both tactical and always has the perspective of the military unit that the image maker is impelled with that sister function of being with their unit and viewing the battlefield from the respective some people will say it speaks well the photographers are the cameraman then rely on the uniformity that built up personal relationships whether they want to or not the colors the kind of coverage that there old to provide and no doubt there's an element of that if you're undefended another will be of to protect you in that moment but more importantly the structure of that simply means that you have no choice really but to have the perspective of that military unit so if you look at afghanistan and we look at the cover of a number of protagonists from two thousand and nine that was noticeable was that there was a
619.26,622.95, large group of followers who independently
623.07,648.93, deducting work from one location a coronal valley in afghanistan where there was a particularly intensive encounter and military struggle between us forces in the belly and celibataires in that very it was no excellent that all those potomac out of that particular location because when those photographers wanted to go cover the afghanistan war
649.2,652.95, whether military talk them to that location
653.01,672.45, first of all every one ends up in the same place for a moment so we getting to see not the entire country not the range of possible conflict between the us of lightfoot but just in their location and then we get in to see what's taking place in their valley from
672.48,684.36, the us forward basis from the us military locations with the us soldiers as the principal characters in in the coverage of that of that story and that's just
684.48,736.38, inevitability of setting up a system of embedding journalists in that way that if you win imbed them with those military units they will have perspective therefore what we get to see at home as it were it's something not dissimilar to what a hollywood movie would get to show you off particular conflict and would have resonances of second old man military accounts residents of vietnam resonances of more recent conflict because that perspective would be from the military perspective looking out to what you don't get to see in those or very rarely in these accounts are the people that are being for against the insurgents we don't see them it will the faces we anterior with one their account they don't play a role somehow they kind of absent
737.64,755.37, deems to be allusive heart find and you get the soldiers talking about that sort of thing and in frequently you get to see the civilians who were caught up in the conflict and when you do get to see them it's only in their encounter with the u s military and all the constant place with that
755.46,765.39, and as often actually because they like to come casualties of its ring or or unintended casualties of the fighting itself so this
765.42,780.96, a very but ticular way in which that embedding system constructs visibility and it makes certain things visible and certain things invisible and that's really effecting what we get to see about on ingatherings an
782.49,804.87, the one
