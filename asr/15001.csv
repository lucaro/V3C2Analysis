1098.15,1100.76, it was like a
1101.03,1144.23, we all doomed if we are knowable cable in west not gone quite as with us were we concerned about seven as the recoil is interesting some things that might come out of that are not to be real pleasant said tempered under deadline to adjust her attempt going to go up some are going to go down the androsace will be a neutral revenita change but it will make us charge a corn the way the federal government thinks we should do it by a very confusing and complicated formula that will make us charge
1144.35,1150.89, that we've always charged if you had six or seven hours to pay for six seven holes if you literary in the nursing home
1150.98,1152.9, and you paid

1161.36,1172.82, some of the other things that are happening a little more confusing and a little frightening one of them is called re transmission consent and what that means is we have always had an agreement
1173.0,1184.73, arrangement with all the broadcast channels that we carry absences local caliber or fox channel whatever
1185.54,1187.52, our cable system
1187.55,1189.17, to reach our customers
1189.17,1192.26, we bring them to marcus of difficult for them to get to
1192.41,1200.93, we needed them on our system so our customers have all the network that they can flouting with their cable channels and not have to have anything special
1201.17,1246.14, one big package for it's work that pretty equal they gain from it we gain from it everybody's happy well a government looked at it and said no chapelain that if the broadcaster want you to pay for their service you should have to pay for the right to carry my mother have a choice i don't have to ask for that they don't ask for that we automatically have to carry him in but if they ask for payment than we do in a negotiating situation with all of the local channels and distant channels that we bring in that abradatas very concentrated
1246.14,1258.26, but whether or not they lost or not they were very i mean they no question they just gave us consent right off the bat and were very very pleased with that we have now worked out an arrangement basically with all except one of our
1258.29,1313.52, broadcast and the only one that's remaining out there is our fox channel the fox channel is a different story than most o the rest they're being basically represented by the fox network it's not the individual lontaine's doing negotiating the network is doing negotiating for all the affiliates and were getting pretty close to some dead lines here and we're a long way from greenhithe or four five stations now there's so many that sororities really to their advantage to the starlight it's definitely the ensete onsartain badly too
1313.55,1340.7, some are going to want him and going to be very upset if we don't have them and there are a lot of customers in town i can pick up those channels the local channels even with a decent weathertight if you had to increase somebody's rates as result of this or take a channel of it's not the government that people call in complaint to ritching
1340.85,1341.99, customer
1342.17,1352.16, that channel i should send in the bill directly instead of using us as the middle man to collect money for them and if they want to get in the patisserie
1352.97,1365.81, we just think they ought to have us out of all because we know were the ones are going to pay the heat when a benches gets passed on to the consumer and it could take what congress is supposedly offered a decrease
1365.99,1372.02, america is really not going to affect anecdotes some customers here or not others
1372.05,1380.72, but then they're going to turn right around and if a lot of cable customs have companies have to pay a lot of dollars for re transmission and sent
1380.99,1386.36, whatever a decrease people god is going to go up the old fool hold in winter
1386.36,1388.58, in what we're going to do now
1388.64,1418.04, is going to sound like you know something we often the future somewhere and if you heard the morning show on the radio yesterday morning you know what we're fiction to do and this is not something that's going to happen from norway
1418.13,1422.9, i want you to do is to give a sort of an overview
