18.3,23.22, he
23.76,41.28, fatality as therapy very effective therapy in fact who said so i said so because that is what i believe
41.31,57.96, i think the torpor is just as effective as any other there based on somebody's belief one has to be careful as to what one believes especially if it comes from so called sources of authority for example
57.96,64.56, he is a source of authority you trust that you believe in them
64.95,98.67, and eat something that is artificial made from chemicals alien to the bodies of militant process effectively made from questionable sources why not when no less an author of in the day tells you that it is safe and good for you then one day on a whim you decide to read the labels for yourself you go even further and investigate for yourself ingredients of what is inside that so called food stuff and what i can do to your body your health you will be
98.79,122.16, you come away very shocked at what your eating noting that you actually ingesting things that were never meant for the human being to ingest once upon a time the scholars of the day taught and believed absolutely that the earth was flat to not believe that meant one of two things
122.49,150.27, and you are stupid and an educated and more you are a heretic to be executed very strong words but in fact that exactly what they did believe systems can be very strong with some very serious overtones for example you may want to look up the origin of the word picnic in a cent in a word as it is in
150.75,178.14, and then read what happened at picnic like setting in our history he really need to keep in mind that it wasn't that long ago that certain members of her society were not considered human beings people from no less an authority than the bible erecting to the clergy these sources of authority would determine which among us would deserve civil rights and which would not
179.1,184.59, i said the life systems can have some very serious complications
185.61,202.02, one entire the educated ones of the day were the clergy and if they said that the earth was a center fevers then as an onager person you had no choice but to believe that the center of the universe was in fact earth
202.02,239.55, i do not believe that you would of course risk the fate of execution think about that i did to day i thought about that as i drove on which dock road to day this is where they would throw women accused of being witches into a lake on which the code and if they drowned that proved it they were witches free thinking women were simply not allowed they were a freethought and you run the risk of execution by drowning i have no idea how many women were murdered that way
239.61,248.76, after all they were which is so maybe nobody even bothered to keep a record of those which is
248.94,253.8, will you say that could not happen to day really
253.95,263.64, do you really believe that our justice system is infallible without bein deliberate imperfections
263.7,350.97, the last time you entertained yourself by questioning what you really believe about anything your religion your heritage your politics your parents or any so called sacred cow not to be question areas of your life as an oneida person that is to say am not learned and so an disciplines meaning that i am free to think as i wish dogma does not save me and as an ignorant person on so many different levels on having to do with so many different subjects i am free to draw my own conclusion based on three things my knowledge my experience and my feelings now that is freedom of thought don't get me wrong i'm not advocating ignorance quite a concourse a matter of fact i am saying now what you're talking about and now what you actually believe in is so in other words substitute facts for fantasy regardless of the authority who generated that fantasy i believe that pattern it is really really really good serpent so now you can share your belief with me by sharing your comments and your suggestions thank you
