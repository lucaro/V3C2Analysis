0.06,36.03, by this is meg from niblack foods thanks for joining us today we have a special guest and this is very from arsinoe varies going to help us learn about his wonderful company his wonderful soup bases and what were malthouse them in well first of all thank you for having me here i appreciate your business and i appreciate your interest in our products or so fine food was founded in nineteen seventy two by rubicon and his wife helen ruin was working for a company that was purchased
36.06,75.69, and rubens customer base were chefs ruin was not satisfied with the way the new company started changing some of the soup bases they took the ingredients that they were using and the cheapener and reuben had complaints from the shafts he is latouche and he promised them that he would do something about it that's how our sea find food got started our sea started out of a garage and back a rubens home his three children susan barbara and gary were involved in the business to the point where they were packing the cases and tape and man carysfort job was to roast the garlic
75.93,88.08, roasted garlic and he still has those clothes he still had those clothes up in the attachement in a while and the kids start talking about things that they are not appreciating about life
88.14,168.99, let them see you just what it was like growing up into this business now the family owns the business still susan is the president barbaric present garry the other vice president so we are a minority on business and met with a women business enterprise no part of the reason that we got started with what i was saying about the chef the chef wanted to produce customarily we sell our products all over the place and i can recommend for people to go to your website because you are so wonderful video just showing you the facility that they will gorleston that your product is doing out there that's making a different well one the things that i would to beginning is the reason the company was created was because a chap's needs
168.99,194.04, and then asking us to do certain things for them so we have our ear to the grindstone we have people like me all over the country and we are in touch with our customer base daily and were always asking the question what looking for what do you need what's important to you what are your challenges so for example one of the more recent challenges that we were asked about her to reduce sodium
194.37,246.72, not just low sodium which is in a regulated issue at one hundred forty milligrams pretences but they were saying thus will the low soundest have in flavor is it's too light so in what can you do about that so one of the chefs gave a side and we ended up developing a reduced sodium soup basis cold smart sodium nobody else in the country has this product for handmaids penthouses we go from thousands to one forty and it's a big adjustment for people now we've given him a midway point and it's very helpful as far as the chef's being able to take that and adhesiveness the favorite
246.78,258.69, so that's just one area another area that were distinctly different is that these formulas that we are using once we've developed it and we've put it out there with our customers
258.81,261.39, the same supplier that gives us the chicken
261.51,306.72, the same day we've been using for years right we're not jumping around to find it cheapest chicken the cheapest beef cheapest le stock we have consistent suppliers one case in point in our seafood from the england ravening the same guise for years same boats so what it gives us his andante and that we can claim that there's consistency for these people that are loyal to our products to begin with and when they put out a product they know what to expect so they make a super sauce using these products they know that they can count on it being the same and not getting surprise complaint from one of their customers exactly create well we hope our customers have the same result in a now they will 
306.81,315.54, other question because we were actually out working with a much ascalon what do you in your you know your
315.57,349.17, around the wet the upstate new york area and pennsylvania new jersey and traveling around the country which you feel your the shops are really looking for these days a great question and you know that's the first question i asked them you know what are your challenge and one of the things that we're hearing you know gutenfels become a big topic you know years back it was unheard of what is glutinosa discovering what that means so we're dealing with gutermann is a person who is intolerant to wet
349.17,380.07, products and if you look around and the ingredients in a lot of the products that you can soon there's a weed in the face for example is always developed with wheat and doesn't have to be so what we did as we developed a gloree product we were talking about that with a lot of chefs today and it was something that's on their especially in their catering men where they need a point that out to their customer prospect they once to get a catering job done and and the customers looking for special diet needs recently in massachusetts there was a college
380.19,393.42, in massachusetts that was sued by other students right because they didn't offer gluten free diet choices for all meals of the day and if they can't eat they can't stay and if they can't study their paying money for what
393.72,401.28, it's been you know very popular college is lately to go to but in free another area is began
401.34,420.78, it's been very important to especially in younger people dining to look at van products and we have a vegan flavor product that is a beef flavor and a chicken flavor nobody else has that the very unusual so what would that be for let's say you wanted to make it chilly
421.32,423.03, van chilly
423.36,442.41, most began chile most chillis you would think i have a bee flavor to it plustost so if you are making it with our vigilare product it would be almost like it had amerikay another place you can go is you know let's say we were making french onion soup
442.62,467.52, most of the time though use be base and that so here we have another option for that and you can go on expand on that many different ways and we are so went with the we went with the low sodium with that as well said that because french anunit can be solitude go back to the gluten freely quick we were discussing earlier your facility and why
467.52,495.21, but fifewell when we started out into the glut free business one of our owners on the principles has a gluten free issue okay and so he studied up on it and he went to the national silly act awareness foundation which is the umbrella organization than helps establish standards for how to produce a silly act free product gluepot and they gave a tigurines
495.27,535.77, and we follow those guidelines whenever we do a batch it's the first run of the day before anything else has taken place in the plan is in the segregated areas so there's no intermingling of other weed products that may have entered that room and that matches prepared and finished and held in a private secluded are so to speak so that is close to any other but product because you don't want outward landing on the cases and then being shipped out and somehow making it into a lutenist where the kitchen is totally good and free and i but we in their kitchen anyway we have all these standards in place and before we release the product
535.86,552.09, even though we have our own laboratory that test the product and it's right ritratti party to a laboratory a certified laboratory outside of our business and we get a certification on the batch the whole idea there being we know for certain
552.36,611.4, when it leaves our facility it truly is gluten free so when a shaft that's important that mother your son which your daughter is going to have blue free supper sauce or whatever here it truly is and when the things that we should mention is that this is what we're currently carrying that what we're starting out with archfiend foods has two hundred and seventy products we would have to have an archfiend food store so what were bringing in and to day once again we were out in the local area and the premier beef faced the primaries base and this even roasted chicken he was a huge success then we were able to go with the low sodium as well as the gluten free vegetarian we brought in the sea food base because it is locorum and seafood bases
611.52,639.99, very high and so dim so that's a nice alternative but there's many other basis that we can bring in lobster crab all other kinds of different places we can go with that i was excited about a low sodium hambone again very hard to find make your wonderful split pea soup with something really good and the chicken as well as the low sodium face very
640.23,656.76, what differentiates the premier base lines so we brought in the roasted the oven roasted the chicken and the beef from the rest of the line where i will too good question its first to taste preference right you know you like to nilachal
656.79,665.31, so it's a little bit of that in just a callithamnium her going see some ingredients in here that are not in the oven roasted chicken
665.4,675.12, so it's an ingredient change and of course you know ingredients affects what it's going to take like so this has two american okay it also has gone in powder
675.3,678.18, this one over here does not have to marian it
678.48,721.41, a little bit more chicken fat in it what we try to do with this particular one this is the open roasted chicken we wanted to get the taste of the rothesay chicken into the jar you know give it a real nice flavoured profile but i'll tell you why there's a lot of people don't want to go to that when they're making a gravies or the making or sauces or the making their soups and i want to go with something like this that has this particular flavor bootha's while we make six different types of chicken bassenthwaite there giving to his when your chest
721.65,723.3, i don't like to taste it that one
