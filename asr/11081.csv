0.09,7.8, he 
8.31,20.25, one will come to the mellowest out began as you can probably tell i am not molasses but i am here to day to present you with a genial thecla for beginners
20.37,41.34, and in heart and i run the yoga with cassandra out channel and i do specialize in the nagas man will used the cited to collaborate and do a video for each other's channel if you enjoy to day's practice and on to do more noise i encourage you to come subscribe over to my channel and while you're here also definitely subscribed to melissa you became
41.64,72.36, going to need one block and one strap for today's ygarape if you don't happen to own these props it's not a big deal so a great replacement for a strap is a belt so just like a regular belt for your passelewe really well and if you don't happen to own a block you can get some relief stick or dense cushions or you can even grab a really large book some people who might have a little bit more flexibility and might not even need to use any proper this practice but it always got to have a couple of options around you just in case
72.9,135.72, so if you are unfamiliar with the practice of gin you it's quite different from other style such as half hour of inasa or power you so insidious ing on our muscles in ginghams the focus is on our joints and honour connective tissues so we do not warm up before practicing in yoga which i know a lot of people think is kind of strange but by not warming up were able to send the stress and send the benefits of the poses to or connected to shoes and cordons as opposed to our muscles and indian ogowe are holding poses for an extended period of time a period of time so it can be anywhere from two to eight minutes depending on what we're doing so we always want to make sure that we're not pushing ourselves too far in erasing way to gain some flexibility and increase your range of motion in your joints but because we are in the poses for such a long time the student has to be very mindful and very respectful of their own bodies limitations and any injuries that you might be working with so
135.84,206.76, always like to tell people if you're looking at a scale of one to for intensity were ten is really painful and union to stay out about a four or five so just enough so that you are feeling a stretch but not so much so that it's really hard for you to hold the poles or you feel other areas of your body certain to tighten up and contract this is a beginner friendly ginguene and actually just going to start sitting up in a comfortable position it can be cross legged like i am or up on a block of that works a little better for you and we're just going to open up the neck so enamored things to do sitting up nice and tall drop the shoulders down and away from the ears and you want your chin parallel to the ground it just going to drop your right ear towards your right shoulder so the giniselli tly elevated here you school start to feel this a little bit towards the left side of your neck if you'd like to make this a little bit more intense a little juicier you can reach your lasting or tip out to the side and you can even bring your right hand to rest over the top of the head so instead of applying a downward pressure on your neck think instead of pulling the ear a little bit further away from the shoulder so you're increasing that space there to find her intensity
207.21,210.36, four or five on a scale of one to ten
210.6,215.46, enough so that you feel sensation but it's not painful in any kind of way
216.03,218.28, you find yourself in

553.86,555.54, his fall open
556.29,623.16, you're welcome to put a block underneath the knees or underneath the hips if you feel like your rolling and falling backwards all heating the hips will make it a little bit easier for you to tilt forward and you can play with the distance that you have between the heels and the grains of the closer you have your heels in towards you the more you'll tractates towards the inner this and interring and the further away they are the more you probably feel this towards the outer edges of your legs so find the positioning that works for you and feels the best for your hits and we're going to walk or comforter so this is not a half a yellow are not trying to maintain a flat back in the nogais doing the work for us and we want to relax the muscles all muscles as much as possible so that we can get into our joys as opposed to working the muscular body so walking upon forward i like to turn my palms i face up to resist the temptation to push and pull so there is none of that going on and when you find your edge you can let the spine naturally round and the head hang heavy if you're somewhere close towards the floor
623.4,634.11, having a prop and placing it beneath the forehead or underneath the chest and make the poles a lot more comfortable or you might prefer to just let yourself hang heavy
