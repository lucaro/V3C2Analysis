0.03,33.09, i know something that really resonated for me when i had a conversation with a guy who wasn't from canada this was around last year in a twenty sixteen baseball season when the days were doing really sort of mediocrity it wasn't that they weren't going to finish close to the top of their division is just they were playing poorly in a season in which they eventually went to for the second consecutive year to the sea to the championship series
33.72,35.4, and the guy was saying
35.4,42.3, i really don't like how you guys are fans and by you guys he was meeting like you know the established canadians that were here for a while
42.39,48.18, i'm not a real big baseball fan but i got into a couple of games and i like the game and like the experience
48.54,50.76, he said you guys are fickle founds
52.89,413.34, and he was a football fan or fan from turkey and he like you know we support galataea we support gatestone matter what if the winning or the losing we're going to show for every game with our scarves and whatever football fans do and we're going to cheer them on no matter how good their playing in the aminabad season if they're having a mediocre and that really resonated with me again the i said for the reason that tahiti the fans and trooper sense and be very fickle it doesn't apply in the case of the maple leaf for some reason i lean this last year which was a pretty seller year with a bunch of rokesmith or canada center to the this was happening a much real went to the hacketts utterly bad they would never be that kind of fancied for some reason the owners of the maples have succeeded in creating a kind of an ethos where being a malian is not about hockey it's about being a belief in but the jaradic rent ball game here in this town and if the jarno doing well for some reason people talk smack against the jade that doesn't stop roger center from filling up more than forty five thousand francs for almost every single game but it's just it's earphone on that you'll have people talking magians the jays this year and twenty seventeen the jays are not doing very well their fifty one in fifty seven it's two thirds of the way into the season the great half games back the ringless place in the east in the most competitive division in all of sports not just in baseball and all sports the least americanly east is the most competitive division the yankees boston tametomo reels and thrown of luis the most impeditive division in all of competitive sports anywhere it is emotion that has the most party but what i want to say is that baseball can be a metaphor for life and i think the reason that baseball baseball expressions have entered the side guys to enter the lexicon or the jargon you know whatever hoistings know made it to first base in a home run grand slam out of the park strike out in all these different expressions that entered especially in corporate language i think because baseball a super metaphor for what's going on in life you know you could be happy in mediocrities and the the season is over two thirds of the way of the isanusis place doesn't mean you can you can't pull off a comeback you know if a batter having a bad slump you're just in a slum beaterio not logging down deals are you reggitt gigs or your connecting jobs you're just in a prolonged slumdom you can to be in the sun or the entire season yandher looking at it from the flip side just because yes because he had a great season last year decimo going to have an automatic lassois yearlin the work you know he still have to go out there and your forward bad every single game do you work to your batting practice to your drills get on the plain travels to the different cities have road games do your stretching you know it's i love baseball for that reason is one of the most grueling sports your beans and comes in ortheris that watch baseball games and say it slow and boring they really do know what they're talking about it's so difficult to tabatha being flung at you and oftentimes over ninety miles an hour to try to hit it with a stick that you know not wider than i don't know for i isocrates twenty or twenty five inches in length you know whatever the matadores it's a completely difficult game and that some of these unaesthetic opportunities many lessons from it and to help a lot of people to be kind of relating any difficult difficulties that they may be going to going through to to whatever the jays are experiencing as a team as a collective so maybe just to rest reiterate some of the lessons from this particular log first of all don't be a fickle fan don't be a thickened there be fair weather you have to be stalwart be there for people in the matter what and you have to be there when you start something you have to take it out you can't just you know go into a thing and then drop people whose a singsong going so well that can include a marriage relationship business proposition or any other endeavor that you choose to embark upon the second last onstott over the yokemate coin the expression and in popular base a lexicon and looketh famous catcher for the yankees in nineteen fifties he is the guy that actually said it over till it's over so it inoperative the seasons that denied and the jays are only five and a half games out of the second while cards but so it abetting things could happen between now and the end of september may be the last thing is baseball is a really tough game anybody who thinks it baseballs at easier a boring game that's a bunch of fat guys baseball players have the top trainers talent exercise coordinator watrin programs just as rigorous just as cretinism other sport be a tennis or football or you know or whatever european football crisscrosses have to do every single other thing that every other at the athlete has to do but they have to do it on skates anyway come back video blog
