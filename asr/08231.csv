0.03,21.87, homoioteleuton
30.75,43.77, the saving we spoke in about the diagnosis of bindeth and maisead a lot of information fairly quickly there's another important more personal area that we really only touched on and that's around the consent for argentinian
44.22,45.57, let us
46.02,55.41, for in it were talking about a very stressful time and it's important to take a step back for a moment and really discuss the decision making process that goes on in this situation
55.68,58.5, to assist us with this discussion
58.53,60.99, my pleasure to introduce benefit richards
61.38,66.48, selector at the university of adelaide with the research focus on medical law
67.95,83.28, you've done some research in the past on the community attitudes towards a catenation can you outline for us to night about this end and what your research is found sure we are involved in a team a couple of years ago that did some quite extensive research
83.37,92.43, community attitudes into actually embryos and organs back into mannering will they are foretime 
92.49,100.41, an interesting starting point from some of the things that we that we asked was one question we asked as we had had 
100.44,104.67, thereabouts of a brain dead person now
104.76,109.62, follow and from the information with with heardred
109.89,123.48, the community views they show that there's a lack of certainty and a lack of understanding of brandon alone community because we had five percent of our respondence were quite clear they say yes
123.84,128.25, that's a dead body but only twenty avenante five per cent said
128.49,130.2, a living body
130.23,140.61, shows that there's a lot of understanding of the real status there so we found that quite interesting we then ask
142.05,148.62, i think ought to be making these kinds of decisions now 
148.74,151.83, we talk about organization as a whole
152.16,160.89, percent to the majority of our respondence actually said yes we are in support of organtin and
162.15,174.6, in theory we we fell because they'll seventy three per cent on giving you a lot of numbers hubert quite off the next the easiest way to make sense of it said that the decision of whether or not to donate rests
174.75,181.23, the actual person who is the nearly dead person it something that we a decision we make in our life
182.43,185.79, to have her to our bodies when we are dead
186.66,195.81, a small percentage around percent who said that it's really up to the immediate family that partner this past the children the parents
196.5,200.28, if there is a conflict between
200.73,206.46, a choice and what the family wants we had seventeen said
206.61,213.81, i think that we ought to happen is what the donataire during their life even if it upsets
214.14,221.55, the man and that was the community views that tom that that way we received
225.03,233.49, do you think from your research and the work that you've done in the syrian what do you actually think determines people's willingness to do now he got any
233.55,242.76, monterey instinctive and dust we did get some evidence that hircanians levels
243.42,268.14, and towards a support for organ donation but i think it's i know it's a hell on this piece of string and a thing it's as individual as anything i think it's an i think it's religious in its personal experience of antoine
268.47,276.66, i think he's just a whole variety of different factors that actually come into play and it's a very very complex process
278.82,280.32, explain
280.35,304.83, we hedged around hissef consent and so could you explain to us the the consent of medical treatment from a legal point of view medical treatment to during our aloose we actually have a very fundamental right to agree to what is or is not done to our bodies so consent to medical treatment legally
304.83,306.66, about a conversation
306.69,322.02, it's about a conversation between the person who will be treating and the doctor and the patient is about an exchange of information the more averse to it as material information and this is a whole great
322.29,326.52, lecture about this but at its very simplest
326.52,332.67, information is that information that would influence your decision making process
332.88,339.42, a difference to you and that usually goes into the risks inherent in the treatment
340.29,358.53, the possible outcome of the treatment positive and negative and of course what happened if you don't have that treatment and the bottom line is of course the autonomy of the individual person where we as individuals watering initiate move on
358.71,363.48, in him it happens after we are dead as we are living we have the
363.66,368.25, no right to agree to what is or is not done to us
369.09,371.94, that different to consent for organization
373.47,375.24, the whole living and dead
375.42,385.47, the socinian absence of the conversation of the contemporaneous conversation conversation must happen before him the conversation must have been
385.5,401.58, for such as these are with your family and consent to organ inaction is really something that takes place as a result of legislative provisions so to do me to explain what they are
402.42,419.13, straw actually have a very rare situation were all of the states agree with each other we have a group of a group of collectively called the human tissue the one ensorcelled the transplantation and a native
419.46,422.76, nations of the scription around the state
422.79,424.98, here in south estralla
425.34,433.23, a provision in the legislation which is essentially that the
433.89,440.16, officer who had been introduced to is to be comfortable
440.52,450.54, there is evidence that the dye has concerned during their life to being a din now quite often 
450.72,462.15, they only ordination registry would be sufficient he and outstation course is all in our drivers lasses and so then and to be
462.18,469.29, consideration of what on the register now according to the law if there is
469.92,491.07, no such evidence then they need to turn to what's called the salvable next of kin which is a higher after you have relations to you now for a child you say your vallyble next of kin is your parent then either a brother or sister if there overattention for an adult it's your spouse
491.28,500.52, sunderiand then it can be parent or brother or sister said the parents about the brother or sister
500.79,502.86, so then the lower
502.86,505.59, having a conversation
505.62,511.11, the next of kin if there is evidence that
512.61,542.16, to dine had specifically said no during the life because he can register and know as well then there is also ran for that conversation the another conversation is to determine whether or not there's been a change in view or circumstance or maybe that her conversation over the recent times to indicate that perhaps while they work they hadn't got around to benalder weren't on the register they would like it for they were on the register but something's happened
542.22,546.54, they've changed their minds so that conversation happens
546.54,551.4, but we done by proxy with the family at times
551.91,553.59, essentially legally
554.7,557.82, another register
557.91,562.68, enough authority however were him and veins
563.01,565.23, also
565.53,567.0, real
567.0,569.64, charged situation
570.21,573.84, this one very real people before
574.68,586.65, instead the colleges that need to be talked to so alongside the now we have national and medical research council the united masses have ethical guidelines
587.04,591.39, and i chicagoans very clearly stipulated
591.48,592.59, to do
592.83,597.42, headlines very much like came their antiquities
597.51,613.77, very much like the lord but there's a little bit of a change and is quite a subtle shift but it's a significant shift because it talks about that the need to have their conversation with the family and the need to respect the family
614.88,615.93, and
616.08,634.89, i respect the fact that whilst this legal he is author also ethical considerations here and there's a morning process and that the family needs to be respected and the guide lines say that if there is evidence of significant upset
635.1,637.77, in the family then
638.04,641.76, you not to proceed even if
641.91,657.75, evidence that the person has indeed consented because according to the itineraries of but a very nice place here which is that consent in these circumstances is a permission it is not a director or mandate
660.09,661.65, and so
662.04,665.07, the consent process is quite
665.1,671.85, it's not black and not in the law would like it to be it does as far as
672.03,681.36, possible for a black and white but imbedded in the law is the recognized recognition of the very human process that were going through
682.92,686.88, just to clarify cannot condemn person consent thing
687.75,708.24, contrite can take all reasonable steps in a comes back to this conversation i think we can take all reasonable steps we can put it we feel very strongly before again then we put a name down on the road to stop we have that conversation with our families we do everything that we possibly can
708.33,709.71, as
709.95,712.11, at the end of it all
712.29,714.03, and
714.24,724.62, northmandy i cannot dictate what does or does not happen to your body can't except for dinner to reach
724.86,729.78, about lately and so then as soon as
732.57,738.72, existence is not there or personality is not there then this then we become
738.99,741.99, of individuals that are around us parting
743.13,768.18, that's really steps to some pretty tricky issues or maneuvre there be some questions about that we were going to take questions now but we are short of time so we just got to defer all the questions until the end if you bear with us through that because we just have some other very important things that we want to cope with you thank you been
