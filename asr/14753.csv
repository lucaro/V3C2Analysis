55.2,61.11, you can do it activity to lastly a couple of minutes and still get a taste of what it's like to be a scientist in reality
61.23,94.2, the way that the nights not work would take science concepts and experiences and practices and brings it to the public in noetic real way is some of the best i've ever seen i think it's really fighting that we have made hundreds of kids and have put these out all across the country and it's really the unique resource in the sense that we distributed these to science center museums in urban areas molares were reaching a really broad swath of people children museums comari different sizes with a network like this network
94.32,101.7, they are able to not only get programs that they otherwise would have access to but also to grow
101.7,105.45, in a way that continues to progress their mission
105.75,113.46, allows them to better serve their audience allows them to better serve the needs of the kids in their community
113.55,166.29, science enters and science is superior and to engage this kind of audience because there is a different kind of education revetting in schools so allowing them to have a lot of freedom an exploration instead of learning my standard when a nice neat kit arrives in the male it's a box full of potential it's a boxful of you know memories that are about to be made that something really special and that we try to deliver on every time we bring it up to the floor the volunteers are excited to be a part of this network and the visitors are excited to inattention learn something new or they are excited charcoaled know
166.86,286.32, the greatest things are you know using a telescope for example getting someone whether it be a child or adult and look at the telecaster for the first time it's actually see that it has in seaplane in orbit you can look at their face but the excitement their energy their now you cantonments it indelicate to because i feel like i would be sightseeing as a single solsgrace myself and that's a really big tool for us as ambassadors to be able to have a partnership with these museums were the platonists and researchers who could help us with that content piece of the science that we do here at the museum we have an opportunity to hopefully change someone's live especially with children to get them to hopefully look towards a future and stem looking towards a future in space exploration or attendant if we can affect one life make one positive change get somebody to go towards the sciences is just a huge opportunity
