4.02,16.11, started the photographer i think you know if you're lucky enough to get an age in or someone help sally work and i remember showing them some pictures i took my first against
16.11,19.44, you you take the still tottered 
19.89,25.83, take some textures and spending the time trying to convince people they are great still acadien
26.13,29.55, in homelands cape or whatever show portrait
29.97,33.0, just how are you supposed to live a life
33.06,34.68, bound to
35.1,37.05, a little category
37.29,43.53, you can allow yourself to not be bound by the medium you working in especially now
43.8,47.76, there's more of a possibility of creating things and the finding
47.79,51.06, action through the work that doing i think
51.21,55.8, that we all think about especially in the early days like an art school is
55.98,58.14, this course
58.23,64.5, voices that comes up every time we look at a piece material or think about responding to mesembria
64.77,69.81, log you've read every piece of arousing in moliere
70.2,76.11, centralisation all of a sudden has a voice and speak up when you
76.2,85.08, trial or when you think about making something a lot of my focus from in terms of my own development of notice is that i'm just trying to
85.14,93.18, quiet the voices down that come up so that i can simply get to the point where i find my honest response to something
93.27,99.21, and when you honestly respond to something it's unique because you responded to it
99.3,102.81, looking back at the work that i had been committed to for the last
102.9,107.07, and so being a three step process for me
107.13,109.59, as you know to have a concept
109.62,111.39, important to me to have
111.51,114.66, the initial sort of curiosity
114.72,117.54, idea i wonder what happens if
118.2,119.61, sort of question
120.57,124.59, and so one i have a concept i can collaborate because i can
124.83,127.65, people this is my one after
128.04,131.61, and i can help them locate themselves in the project
131.82,137.4, concept as real important and that after that i come up with when the system
137.85,145.53, to develop a system for deception you know people say oh you should unitarian what is this solution
145.8,147.33, a problem
147.57,151.53, be so modeled if we were looking at mandela
151.62,158.88, in his office in south africa and he turned the pages and frank grandiose and la and all these different spaces that have been
159.39,161.67, the white chenecote 
162.15,165.39, somehow made it about what i was after rather than
165.42,167.13, surrounded it
167.19,170.61, i go out and i photographed you know animals
170.73,174.99, i decided to go to shoot species a white
175.62,177.66, i'm interested in
177.84,184.8, connect it to the species rather than what separates us and i'm interested in portraying that in a space that
184.89,189.36, allow for the first time for views everything they have to offer
189.87,193.83, well you know it's a lot harder if you look in at the elephant and
193.92,196.11, i don't live in
196.29,197.79, you know 
197.97,200.13, these things separate us more
200.16,204.45, that's the sort of stage to a systematic collection of data
204.54,218.01, organization of data so then i can say well you know in a book you want to have the same lapeine of each person as their own and reviewing the film i can create the larger conversation i can have a coup of other films in an act that
218.4,223.02, the individual five minute films and i can create this multiple entrepots
223.14,225.78, makes me happy happier than
226.29,232.74, then building a space that has so many doorways that no matter what road you come in on
232.83,236.07, you can find a way and you know what the animal work
237.39,239.7, it was so great to
240.03,243.99, museum show have a sort of a book
244.02,248.4, then have a children's day symbol but dave didn't change
249.12,250.89, the entering point changed
251.04,254.1, i think that the game gets very big
254.19,255.84, when you
256.86,260.13, engagement all different kinds of people
260.25,262.83, distribution channels are endless
