13.17,15.75, nature as future
16.26,18.6, a natural cattle
20.46,29.4, knows how to perfectly insulate or regulate the temperature termites for example design a complex architecture to heat or cool their triton
29.97,33.72, and beaks allow them to regulate their bodies temperature
34.26,53.58, we also have discovered that polar bears protect themselves from the cold with their hollow an insulating hair nature also knows how to optimist best the not alisons ance moved by controlling the water volume that filandieres cavities in its shell could all these properties be applied to the objects we use on a daily basis
53.61,55.26, in order to improve them
58.77,84.39, compare big by memetis projects are a bit far off from the intimate rotate wanted to work so we decided to choose the catassin that we use every day and it also focuses on a number of environmental issues such as water and energy management our approach was the first identified the different environmental analysis that had already been done by other research
84.57,122.28, and what came out was that the kettles maine environmental impact was its electricity consumption when i use so we identified three main reasons the first one is that we always tend to keep more water than we need for instance a leader when we only need a cup the second one is that we have a hundred degrees because we only have one switch so ardea was to find a way to adapt his temperature because many drinks have better romans at lower temperatures and a third point was to work on the kettles insulation because falling the carcinogen pa scandal which refused him plastic kettles
122.28,145.83, he has been a massive shift towards metal which is a thorough aberration because just like with her medal spread heat so we wanted to start from materials that could retain it better just one of your inspiration and living world is a rather new and interesting way to come up with products that are both sustainable and functionally efficient
145.86,196.83, otis is a truly introductory project we met researchers and france and switzerland belgian we met design specialist biology specialists and it enhanced our methodological reflection as well as our formal reflection and it shows the object so identified which animals can bring solutions to these issues the four animals that they selected with the two kind the termites and their particular habitat that not alisande polar each one of them has their special properties the two kinsell interested in terms of fermentation if you do a cross section of its beacon you will notice an albicore that is incredibly efficient and which allows her insulation while being very light and very stiff it is therefore a principle we kept for the design of the kettle creating an external structure that is very insulting to keep the water hot as possible isolated the outside world
196.92,220.86, the term might mount inspired us with its thermal regulation system and the specifically a tea distribution system the termite mound can react extremely rapidly when it comes to heat it can change its temperature very quickly so we decided to draw environ from the system and installed channels in our kettle that spread the heat evenly inside the kettle and said of the unique hot spot as as currently the case with kettles
221.01,246.06, so the nautilus has a filling system that we grow by room these are ballast which just like submarine allowed to go down pretty deep towards the sea bed we have copied this principle which inspired us to design a filling system that works chamber by chamber so it is only filled with the required amount of water the user my truncate able to fill enough one up or two or three or four to only heat what they need
246.12,283.92, spitefuller inspired us for two different things firstly it inspired us in terms of that trial under its skin it has a thick layer of fat that allows thermal conduction losses to be avoided this material inspired us to use terrorised the second source of inspiration a structural on the surface of the skin it has followed white hairs that retain a layer of air the significant volume which allows conviction losses to be avoided maybe lost his by air streams that touched the skin so we restructure the kettle surface with small hollow pinballs to have this added insulation fact
283.92,295.89, he came up the benefits of this kettle are therefore double behave on one hand the environmental impact it is massively reduced and on the other hand i kettleson in terms of functionally and usage
296.67,325.62, in terms of habitat there are other applications for the research we carried out and if we take it to another level if we think about hot water tanks for domestic hot water or in solution or even heating or research on heating water could be many applications this canal called mattie can even be printed in three d it is the proof that nature can inspire us to create every day objects that are both perfectly sustainable and beautiful
