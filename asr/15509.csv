10.2,26.97, i enjoyed louis very active i were a dance when our dancing twice away ah
27.48,29.46, active in the community
30.15,31.65, and
31.65,36.27, the time i think i had that span of surgery
36.33,51.36, then other issues coming into my life i think about four years after that i was diagnosed with polynesia and in a lot of pain
51.93,56.79, as these progress from the spinal surgery i think
56.85,59.16, in level increased
59.34,62.22, starting to live in chronic pain
62.4,74.52, which made enjoying any part of military difficult and subsequently a at that point my marriage broke down
75.27,76.74, and
77.07,82.23, that put a lot of pressure on me mentally and emotionally
82.77,88.62, no doubt in fact idolothytic ally on me and 
88.89,91.35, mind and
91.41,93.84, into
93.9,97.62, and living facility in a night car
97.62,101.94, were ranged a little variation my own for nine months
102.54,104.52, have family or any
105.3,106.53, one of the things
106.8,110.22, i was on my literally i had no body
110.22,118.14, i could really open up to share my pain with many personal pain
118.38,120.63, and then a case
121.38,124.47, was admitted for
126.51,141.51, manuring to thoiteen couple charles at all and then took me a long time recover from there and then subsequently in a wasteland six day in was admitted for this painful
141.6,147.42, and i had been darkness and his pride
147.42,159.3, as in the combination of it or dispel a pat on my admission i was just feeling so ill i'll be very honest about it i
160.02,162.21, i question whether or not
162.24,165.81, i was able to get through it
168.72,171.27, from what my body
171.84,176.13, management of state whether i had the ability to fight it
176.22,181.41, i think i spent most almost a month
181.56,191.88, in hospital situation in that environment from cabul curupita in a transport all coastal to get over that fires
193.23,199.47, and i know that the nurse never god suggested these
199.56,201.69, transition for me
201.75,205.29, to improve the outcome for major recover
205.32,208.08, from a health perspective
208.5,212.67, that in itself just blue might
212.67,215.61, that bloomed
216.93,239.94, put me back with contrition and bred put me back into a little hospital situation where to look at the window and aculeatus hills i could you know will on a will walk out to the front door and i could sit and look at the rose garden and at the beauty of the gardens out there and then i just started to feel
240.33,241.83, we
242.01,245.91, and starting to get my health back
246.24,248.49, for public patient
249.03,252.39, know you a health care system that
252.57,262.47, people complain about and say it doesn't work for me or you know they don't i dissident his look i have an honestly got a bad thing to say
262.62,272.34, the fact of the services that i have received and i mean i've been in a lot of hospitals in a lot of states and over seas and marcones
272.37,275.55, at atostor
275.58,387.72, one of them that's a good question oh i love the idea that you know as they say horses for courses and that we need you know the doctors because of the physiology and the anatomy of people we need the nurses because of you know being clean and cared for in a hospital environment in a bed when in the allowed health professionals because of their individual iser ices that wild love to say people becoming more educated normal he will be coming more educated in a war that they have it say and also that they they really don't have to see you know like an i cure a hundred and fifty to understand the body but listen to their body while your lot and then to have the understanding that with help fish or that are very very open to embracing holistic preach and give them confidence to take back their own personal power and i'm not dismissing the importance of the other old they are so necessary but ultimately it is the patient's body it is the patient who is feeling what is going on and as good as any health provided can be dare not sitting in the same position as that first
387.99,397.38, and also i think to be a patient also educate
397.5,461.73, i help professional so that when you open up to hope fish you are probably in lighting them in a lot of ways about little things they had never thought of which spans thereand it can also increase their skill set which then had another effect of bouncing the act and so i austin that apart from holistic preach a very integrated approach between professional and patient with a cento way sort of a conversation going on
