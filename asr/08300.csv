63.93,69.96, i've been practising her last name ah they are here with the film
70.2,98.07, last fast road which is an amazing journey actually tell us a little bit about the film because i know that everybody seen it yet sure though was actually daniel's idea the concept and the title and a documentary film a dixmont it's the biography of marauders who is the pungent early it's from the bay area and it is much more than a itself
98.7,106.86, and how much more i should say that's pretty good i mean and it's starts off really light and you know 
107.61,111.87, pray journey you know with all her friends but family
112.59,116.07, newspaper clippings and you know lily dearly great job
117.06,119.19, now what made judith
119.34,121.68, you wanted the story to be told
121.92,132.87, i wanted her to be honored in life because i didn't feel like she was very much honored in death you know i mean the way around i wanted to hear to be honored in death because i didn't feel like she was in life
135.06,137.34, at her best friend daniel
137.55,139.2, daniel new lily
139.23,141.45, then lily came over
141.48,143.58, we just had at all in
143.88,149.49, in a music video for my friend daniel delian winfried since i was a teenager and
149.52,196.62, daniel had this idea and he recommended me to danielsville to do it so it was our talking about it and i couldn't get married and story out of my head i was still in him school at the time and went to colombiers in new york and when i finished with school intense said yes so i took the idea to my producer shenac and she was launching her production companies to aspire entertainment and she also loved the story and we thought it would be great to do the documentary film and do a desert to make a narrative feature film so all along had been working on the script as well so now descriptas nine five percent there or done with the documentary 
196.65,208.23, a year to make the documentary that's an enormous amount of time not necessarily unusual for documentary but still a long time how do you stay focus
208.83,224.88, i just wanted to do justice to the material and to make something that i could be proud of and that denial and daniel and all marian's friends could be proud of his well so i felt a huge responsibility to to see it through and you know displacing a mountain of
224.88,244.77, and photographs it was daunting at times and in a god anwondo beset me and i just i prayed constantly and i just kept working on it until it was something i was happy to show well the result is there is an amazing film
244.89,250.56, wondering how difficult was it for you was a difficult how did you feel the first time that you saw the finish
251.97,254.19, was open the whole time i was like a
255.15,257.88, i really did this whole ship
257.91,263.52, oh my god you know i was just amazed you know like she really captured
263.97,304.35, life you know and like our relationship and everything but it was almost like she was peeping over our shoulders you know there was cool imray stood on it she personally he is involved from you know from the beginning throughout we you know touch pace a lot through the different cuts and i work very closely with daniel and winnie daily on and and then the more but the project started to grow is going to be a short to begin with and it just grew and grew and alexandretta make this feature documentary it's just it just took on a life of its own and people sent me footage people send me photographs and so i just had this mountain of material to work with as well as the original interview that we 
304.35,331.11, i had to do justice to the story and make it as visually interesting as possible so along with all the fountain the initials s eighteen around town very pregnant all around lay and i did so whereupon
331.41,345.93, and i think that you know help keep it vitally interesting when we talk about the layers there's a certain texture to the film we were talking before about the fact that there are almost callous there are certain words and phrases that you
346.38,371.31, really enhanced the impact of them by showing them visually on the screen as were still hearing them set as well yeah i did like a little punk rock like cut and pace is very pinkrosia sensitised in these pantomines where you know tell it just cut and pace like in a lot of the fliers that have put the compromises together so i thought that would be cool to dispatch you know and high light some of the 
371.64,408.36, some of the dialogue so then that was another layer were there challenges when it came to an earth and all of that orcival footage and photos will i was really fortunate and that people gave me stuff and daniel and daniel had a box full of stuff daniel had a boxful of stuff lowlihead a box full of stuff and you know aunt enemies for a new marion from like long before comes you know there we tolerate and pictures and in like hersheimmer you know and then lily went from there
408.36,471.39, he put his big puzzle pother and now it's complete so we all can see it you know so cool that's exactly how long the way that's how i describe it it's like it was like a three dimensional puzzle you know more than tredition you know don't even know to call it with like just to put the like the music and the dialogue and the pictures and everything together in such a way that supported the story there is a lot of music as there should be there's a lot of music and it was getting the licensing rights to it was that challenge in any way not not really most of the music was daniel's that he worked on with marian so that was under his publishing company and we had to track down maintenance just put out the adoration and then randy magnus had the early footage of the medes to ears so he was you know he already said to use the footage from that time so just matter of getting all the paper work in order
471.66,479.04, but now the music was all dalmatian
479.4,486.81, yes every part of the music you know in the video there's not one song in their ashes not a part of
486.81,516.75, there is one song okay you know the footage of marian with oranges behind her in the composer nekayah it might my composer so also as she shot he made an original score and he had this idea to do this cute little bubble you know too behind the oranges
516.84,542.01, and then you also made a choice as far as the look is concerned you did not stay sixteen nine you mix it up with the sixty nine four by three yeah i wanted to say true to the original footage as much as possible and and then i just like separating out the elements so we had this deviates footage we had you know the original forest we shot so i just wanted those different elements stand out
542.04,563.64, their own turbot quite happy with the way it's turned out so far yes of course you know this the native documentary and the archival footage i would have preferred if if i had totantora like some of the sound some of the image quality but but the inequality i mean that's been you know i'm really i'm pretty happy with that there's some photographs that
563.73,579.66, that i would have liked to have better quality but i think now i did the best i could with what i had and i'm supersedure happy with how it all came together so he there's maybe that percent that i would have liked to fix here and there you know like
579.69,631.86, especially some of the sound quality of the earlier footage but i'm very happy with howilton we were talking that this is also your first feature film astonishment was supposed to be a short as well and it grew and grew and grew and the first so what's next next we hope to make thee the feature film based on marian's life the script is nine if i present there mollie elmore pass that it and hopefully over the next year we'll do more fifeshire siva so we want to get the film out as many people as possible and and then get the feature film made a theater life as daniel's stories also amazing i think i'd make a great companion piece too to have a book on daniel's life
632.4,657.51, we have a whole series going here which is pretty awesome congratulations again and people want more information on the film they can go to sue at last fast ride filmed not com or on face and in from from the beginning on one more thing i should mention is that from the beginning we had had marian's daughter in mind and is very important for daniel
