2.82,6.66, this is a ringer question what is good to retain
7.23,24.87, where did you get your suit no guess if loosely fat lad was founded with this idea to see maybe open source in different ideals into the mainstream bicetre and now were five years in looking back like
25.23,35.97, some examples did we do it did we fail like have seen some close amplifying people out there like the big audience or talking about think differently like did we do it
36.54,100.14, what do you think then it let's fathers like five you you guys could talk about you know like clever things you saw on the internet to isotta into this romantically influence my life was the waldstein and now i am studying and i think she sent like an article to a linked to an article of wishes being interviewed because she's legally good student in forgot actually what she studying now but it is sinister
101.07,120.93, so she got into computer since because of us well successful takin for every one of those emails we get these ten thousand nasty comments on the internet no those are weasels directly to crescent
122.94,124.26, the questions
126.39,145.68, this phrase release early often and with romaic i wondered if you could talk about the release early part and what is early in outhouse anything in that process of releasing things too soon or how long does it take to cook maybe this is partially for armrest of you
147.93,155.61, ah well i think you should i mean this is part of the liners philosophy 
155.61,157.23, but 
157.26,184.68, explain it i can talk about maybe the in the beginning when i was some of the thinking behind that was just being like we were in the open lid which specially james nine all these people around every one throwing all these ideas out and nobody was hitting publish rinbod was putting these things on line and part of it is because there is some pressure when you put things on line you're putting yourself out there in a way that especially wittysplinter comment and that 
185.07,191.22, of making of this early and often things like giving people this place where they compose things where it wasn't their own website
191.34,224.49, like i remember he said really early one as would never post this on my own life at but it's good enough for a fat tout in it really hurt when he said that but then like two minutes later like i realized that the few got it like that was the whole reason the sight works is because like like he would post his amazing things like the smile project and he would never put that on his own website in so that the early often thing was it was really almost selfish in the beginning where we just want our friends to be publishing more and giving us to interpret
224.79,234.21, we were really doing that and putting a music over videos as a way just to like make people watch them but of course it's not the case it's almost like a metaphor for how we work
235.68,255.27, was another question of the earthly answer it earlier but i was calandrino about and of the use of tactical media i suppose and oh you know when you use faceplate about you know what you save
255.72,258.09, to be commented on it
258.99,268.56, it was hard interestin of it working or not because i think we're constantly wrestling ourselves whether we're really working a really failing like when we're driving around with the goblet
268.77,272.28, the google cars always been like a really
272.52,278.37, like a viral marketing campaign for google and his clan auctions i mean
278.4,279.51, you know
279.54,285.3, i don't know that there's a super big plan there for us i mean there is like a stupid plan like let's make
285.54,298.92, i really killed them and crashed the bike you know cristino a bike and have this little set up scene where people are like oh my god the google corduroy hit his due and he standing on the street coursing it's not my fault it's the car you know i didn't do it and
299.28,304.44, but very few people see this if they see these kids and they know them the kites
304.71,309.42, really a good like bouchette is there so many people
310.68,315.09, he definitely advertised for google
315.18,324.78, and sponsored the somehow we like we think of i mean i think i like that joy scaggs
324.87,333.84, do you think the things you do you know what do you think why do you think that why don't you question you know how even brought up not to do this sort of practice
334.62,336.06, i think that's
337.44,339.93, we get a lot of that and the people
340.32,342.9, you see as many people who say
343.08,360.9, per cent of people say that's clearly not the google car it happens a lot more often in brooklyn the manhattan and it had an people are like that tolerating and then i brooklyn there like that's a pet you know like why were the google car have belike don't they have
362.01,370.8, that they put up there so i know we don't full everybody and then we do we do make the car look stupid
370.86,373.92, like in that coarse way of there's always
373.98,375.87, fingers and
375.93,383.49, talking to people on the street and like my said earlier you know he was talking to a taxi cab driver is like you like the google car and the guys like no
383.49,393.0, oh yeah because it's going to take your job you know and so if that if that conversation happens you know where people like
393.0,396.24, this company that saw the web
396.39,409.08, a kind of their wildness to tame and they did tait and they tamed it so well we we actually can't even see them on the you know on the surface any more we just build our houses and so
409.59,413.4, now they're moving into the streets with these vehicles and glass and
413.52,421.83, same mentality that i mean well don't worry about it i'll build it all for you and then you can come live here sort of
422.28,424.65, process is happening you know so
425.19,440.19, you know we could rail against them like tirelessly argue that they should be you know come more a public asset unless a private corporation or public corporation or we could just make this car have fun going around and maybe
440.4,446.73, or ten different people in the street laugh and may be wanted two of them start to tell their friends like this is
447.03,448.74, like
448.74,453.63, some garbage cans you know clearly it's going to run into some garbage cans
453.87,454.71, now
455.37,494.37, to that question either but we think we did this similar project how many years ago now in berlin was like three or so and i remember when we did it there we ran into this problem where dwellinghouse of his indorsement
498.15,501.72, of the questions
507.63,509.16, all right
509.94,522.78, in a leonora art and sorely monreale astonishes art i mean never really feel the need to explain hey i've made art that what do you think is like people who make this sort of stuff were constantly asked
523.14,529.29, but even to be explained oh i'm an artist and the hacker you
530.34,531.45, he
532.56,613.59, well i think one of the big issues is that this work and this is bigger than then hacking i think or the particular work that that fat lap is doing but it applies to a lot of nemedia artist really questioned so many of the mechanism of the art world that it's very difficult peloponnesians boutenieff
613.59,624.48, to this question again and again and again and to the need for justification for better or worse you know petersham time also
625.41,632.31, i don't know trent from a painting classes the pain or the
632.34,634.14, you see out there
634.5,637.92, pages like pages like i mean 
637.95,644.79, and whatever all the social works became everything became so much mainstream compared to ten twenty years ago
644.82,649.29, also the much broader field of artists is
650.37,654.84, other way and of trying to deal with these topics so
655.77,663.6, doesn't really help your question and you but it's like gascon from yet aside or as a lot of media or in pairs
663.63,667.14, made by like classic media is but the saying
669.27,672.45, o don't i mean we asked that too sometimes
672.6,674.67, don't you
674.7,676.92, that question like when
677.1,679.98, time burners lee or
680.16,703.17, you know processing when a nice were like now like that's not fair like there were people that were up for honorary mentioner whatever the same year that timothy burners lee on the nakanocho some my friends who were in that crew in their dislike cheeses cryolite gave it to the guinea
703.17,706.65, you know they really playing in that same world i'm also not
706.89,717.03, going to like architects are very bad for about this they just want to plan everybody's game you know they're like i'm a designer i'm an engineer but i'm also i can be an artist and
717.18,724.14, statehood
725.55,726.51, yeah
727.35,752.13, and he has houston about like a sort of this community aspect of the group and i remember like back integral days like you jameson even really encouraging different cities to start their own profiteer labor you know really supporting me in different means and then at labarri from that
752.13,773.85, experience to starting a fat land like just how you manage your community and also inspire our communities and like how you relate to others collective alike fears ago does really funny like almost fraide you guys like defiance
774.3,782.31, we have a new program coming up it's called pat and you can lie on your own bed as
782.4,795.96, up and your city so stone for that but it's a very tough yes said as it's a very tough process to sign up this lotharian costumes
797.64,808.47, there were like community development things we learn from going through grafter led that we didn't newland from but didn't necessarily do locate one to one moving into fat right
808.74,824.01, it's so funny to think of the old saying if we learned community development is you know i think our community but one team really learned a lot and armistead artisarlook associating which is
824.22,832.05, much percent criminals all the time cut down on the people and want to be in the membership of our club
832.11,840.87, nobody you know like girl was totally it wasn't it was no centralized we didn't feed out information to everybody and we all collected in one space
840.87,843.33, and so we didn't develop very strong bonds
843.75,852.27, and we were a little bit more controlling over the way we published on the analog to i mean other people couldn't post on
853.86,857.31, trierarch lasher people
857.34,862.56, there were one sawtoothed sides were up
863.31,867.72, you couldn't be found on will any more because the blood was hacked and
867.78,873.24, the other error
873.39,876.51, but then you know not really
876.87,879.45, that you know everyone's on a common list
879.75,884.97, talk with each other is the only difference probably fundamentally and then so we develop these
886.62,891.69, want to see each other we have some idea working on and we share resources better and
891.93,898.68, it was he had made a user account one word for us
899.1,905.79, so he made an internal lister there was a community development team suggestion
906.78,915.33, i mean when i approached by people like they when they say i want to join geranion your own gerthet that still happening
915.48,922.11, it doesn't work that way with that for some reason like a man oh you want to be in at any nowadays are local chapel
922.2,924.6, just want to like being that you know
924.87,932.04, this man still remaining in
933.42,939.51, pages aqui question just you know from your experience hackers
939.57,943.74, would you say the corporations are winning and hacker should just quit right now
943.89,945.96, they feel like
946.02,947.64, is actually going to
948.12,950.13, how you feel about that stuff
953.31,966.12, i mean every day of the pirate bays though on mine i have hope for the future now and again like the i mean those are corporations those are particular corporations
966.48,968.28, who are fighting against
968.76,970.23, that we do
970.29,973.53, certainly corporations that don't fight against it you know
973.8,974.7, that
976.05,984.21, contribute to it awkwardly and somehow by force to i mean you know who would have thought a company like microsoft would just be
984.24,985.83, by
986.34,990.57, a ground swell of popular opinion to do something good you know i mean
991.56,993.42, system which was quite
993.66,996.9, i mean it changed a lot of people and brought a lot of
997.23,1000.41, capabilities that we didn't have before so i mean
1000.5,1001.94, you know 
1002.15,1008.12, there was never so much a fight i mean there was some clear arguments you know with corporations
1008.21,1014.45, and particular corporations that girl had a little argument with because we had a personal kind of beef with the
1014.69,1026.78, you know sometimes sometimes with companies because we take things from them are still parts of their identity and they don't seem to approach it as a war either i mean they understand that
1027.02,1031.97, rations bounced back towards them as much as they bounced as our target to
1032.0,1037.61, making noises like the way ben survey you know he said things used to be like
1039.23,1040.37, the types of
1040.37,1042.56, activity as
1042.56,1063.62, on you know it's like your brain the ease they are all connected together and he said and now it seems like people realizing it's different it's more metabolic or it's like hormones or something we're all just fingerprints pick it up and some corporations don't pick it up and some of the osborns them and then the good guys and they pick it up
1063.62,1066.98, i also pick up some of the things we know for the corporations and you know
1067.01,1069.62, we're all in the same juice
1071.15,1073.88, opportunities and mistakes
1074.21,1105.98, there always will be validity to hacking just because to innovation and i don't mean that in the corporate branded way comes from radically breaking and reconsidering things and that's not what the relation 
1105.98,1111.83, where in the world you will find a lot of the competitors products on tables taken apart
1112.01,1117.56, you know taken apart and dissected and every part and component and you know what is it due
1117.74,1123.2, the way i mean we all learned it's the way they learned to get into school so i mean
1123.38,1144.98, there hacking too but then in a different they also the saying that some of the best arts some of the best art has been created in you know corporate are indeed department and has never seen the light of day in northeast that is simply not what is coming out as product on the market man
1145.13,1156.77, i think really the beauty of hacking and open sources that it's not about continually recreating the wheel i think what's corporations they're always continually recreating the wheels because everyone's got in india but
1156.83,1159.23, open sores and hacking it's really about
1159.26,1169.34, the wheel and you make a new version and then you ate an eddorian someone else makes a new version of the wheel and pretty soon got the crazy carbon fibers thing instead of rock which is what you started with
1170.06,1172.58, anyone ever thought about the fact that
1172.88,1176.21, the electronic art in technology group at
1176.24,1178.28, we're like practicing
1178.37,1181.19, some similar type of thing to media are
1181.19,1183.08, years ago
1183.5,1184.34, you know
1186.26,1192.23, either corporate model they were they were corporately funded you know they were making their working directly with companies like
1192.38,1196.79, park and they were making interesting technology art projects
1196.82,1198.26, that
1198.29,1215.21, do that enough you get fat always thought they was quiet answer dear radical but we did not purpose or anything and and fat is kind of representative of that now were just a bloated with corporations we can't talk about anything else you know there doesn't seem to even be subject matter that
1215.54,1227.84, let its personal onthinkin living from damon right that's something what benwell talk about now like with that question because that's many accepting untidy
1228.59,1232.04, military money and the money 
1232.49,1233.3, i
1234.05,1240.32, at the obese children of experiments and ardent ecology 
1240.56,1285.65, i had had one more questions already asked the looking back question so now we look forward for five years five years from now i mean we're all like between twenty seven and fifty or like are they probably are articular for me is it so the communications will ye okalewaha is but the communications department at falla wants to know what our goals for the next five years are we going to rickety relevant donauwerth
1285.95,1294.59, i was never a plane five years ago so we have one now maisie for a play on not a plan but i would love to hear a future visions for you guys dreams
1302.09,1316.01, yes do i would like to direct his personator what would you like to see that too evident worst person to ask you one definitely you know
1316.37,1322.49, doing what you're doing with the next technology is i think there's a lot of need for you know
1322.64,1332.84, a hacking particularly in the age of web to point and there will be three to one so old you playing field
1333.8,1341.81, i personally think is really respectable about flats that not only are you exploring these ideas artistically but a lot of you are involved in
1341.96,1345.2, doing this in your day jobs and
1345.47,1352.4, i believe these things so much the you're actually putting them into action and i just love the idea the fact that you guys are
1352.49,1358.61, valley you're in all these different spaces and you're actually in acting change and 
1359.06,1360.38, my opinion
1360.5,1368.84, that's what i hope you continue to do is to infiltrate those systems and to have an impact in those in those faces 
1373.46,1384.47, not to end on i think a thank you very much thank you 
1416.93,1426.98, right thanks for coming and stick around if you want is another talk coming up just in a few minutes ben sister is going to present his talk a whole
