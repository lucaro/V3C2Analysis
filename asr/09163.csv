83.1,86.91, like how do daily life was and
87.33,92.01, i saw that it would be very interesting to
92.07,94.26, go and
94.29,120.96, tried to find out i started working with a very simple amateur camera of course it filled because it was in the beginning of the nineties and the reasons were that first of all i didn't look as a photographer so much so i was not treating because i wanted to stay with the people in the houses
121.47,137.94, and i was just sort of visitor of friend to who happened to take pictures the second reason was derisive hardly because i had to travel a lot and i like to travel light so i only had this three small
138.0,151.77, cameras and not a lot of equipment and to sing that would in amand a certain was that it was quite dangerous to travel with expensive cameras of course in them in russia because
151.89,165.42, they would be stolen and so they looked at my camillus i will start
165.87,171.81, showing you a lot of pictures this is 
172.41,177.06, georgia and it is aristocratic family
177.15,180.96, just after the changes got back
181.17,195.6, house that had been living six families in the house at loudons and they could use all the boasting that they had before beata they had been hiding
196.32,201.36, a this is in odessa in moreover
201.45,205.44, and there was a sort of war between
205.59,213.51, do and tarnished and hotels and were children
213.54,225.57, lived a lot of girls were there were at the hop
225.9,239.79, this is to be seals into the and of course there was very often no electricity and so we
239.82,252.24, having or the most clothes we had with us we had to man and the guy who was living in his house where we stay he was always in his morning dress
252.57,261.48, he had newspapers and from the window just to protect from the cold
264.6,267.21, in siberia
271.53,274.35, a funeral also in siberia
274.56,285.54, and i was very lucky because i took his picture from the window of my friends but i was staying from above and
286.08,295.98, we now on week before there was still was slow and it would have been a very lechford taken it
296.28,299.88, in the snow but now i like the much the graphic
299.94,312.15, like a cross all and you can see the coffin is open in russia and the front dapple with music 
314.22,316.5, and a prison
316.89,318.45, i 
323.07,325.32, in a restaurant
325.44,328.5, i'm very much touched by the small
328.83,334.32, that probably have remunerate made an a lot of course
334.83,344.67, hathaway had self made clothes because consentement stores by you could get at culture
345.54,353.61, self made betroth
354.15,380.97, so the people of our posterity and is all hard port and i was i started working in black and white but then seeing all the beautiful colors in russia we had the sebaceous but this colossal i think like aliment to be so i well i really was
380.97,387.87, so much like in this calisthenic to to start taking pictures in colour
391.17,399.45, this is the daughter of my friend he alaister on her bed and the self made mosquitoes
403.47,407.76, friends in danton the door
408.48,411.0, she's the girls very
411.15,415.71, the cure aspen islands on short
416.52,433.08, and you can see as you can see the beautiful wallpaper and the dutiful bad bread i mean of course a deliverie was very fattening and
433.44,447.72, so women of course always tried to make it comfortable in the house and they used everything i could find but of course it was not much but while paper was mostly there
450.0,451.56, to france
456.21,512.37, this is a funny situation the man is my my russian teacher i speak russians because of course will stay with this visitation it was necessary because nobody talked any other language so and he adducta moment asked me quamitic of the friend of his foot wanted to become a mother she was forty years old and of course i agreed so i took a lot of fourteen in his house and she had this fantastic poses and that i thought well i would like to make also some pictures for myself so i asked my teacher to sit there and for them to pose together and we had a lot of fun of course but the sad say of the story is that
512.58,521.64, she became a model and she emigrated to vernet germany and three have never heard of her any more
526.89,528.66, ah this is
528.96,565.17, at interested and this same couple that was sitting on the the demand was one and this the man is the grandfather who was announced to grabut he was also a communist and he was a party member and that he was very reluctant haramontese because he thought i was a spy and it took me days to get his confident and at certain moments and he trusted me and he showed me his party member papers and missus what is doing at a moment
566.43,594.45, but i like what i like about this picture is well this is the atlantic of working with small cameras and of course the display is not so well so you have not always you can can't always see what's happening and what i like a lot is his tippengray having surprised is also sometimes when i see the picture afterward
594.54,596.94, i see you had or i see
597.09,606.18, a movement and it's not disturbing me on the contrary i really liked it because it adds something to respond to it
606.3,609.75, the mate of the picture
610.98,618.96, this is the well of course he is stockracy had to hide himself
619.77,643.41, during communism and this was the first ball in moscow for the autocracy the woman all woman she has she was his apprentice and all the life she has been working as a laborer because she of course it would be havening for her to
643.41,648.69, we feel her background and the girl behind her associate
650.82,667.5, then a dishonesty can see there was no wall paper because it was not not available and this guy he was so happy and proud of his equipment for me it was quite old but for him it was
667.8,671.16, testing a new and you can see the
671.37,674.1, it stir in the corn

714.72,717.15, pilliner
719.16,731.97, this is a bitter woman who collected birds in a room and of course this was very social because there were no no ropes able in the city
732.0,738.78, so it was he didn't want to lose now that his whole room was full as birds
742.44,777.21, one of my favorite pictures its nominal way station and what you see behind is not a bad thing but i really know and well this as so much about life a death time and in communism and poscente solitude if you were now to moscow or to superiorities of course a lot as change but if you go

984.54,1016.34, a collective kitchen in siberia where people were a still a living with a lot of families in one floor and they have a collective kitchen and every woman has her own table and it looks like a chaos but if you look well it's very nicely organized even the plastic bags are hanging in a row and once in an exhibition in the stable
1016.61,1037.01, i had some people commencing on the floor that was not not so nicely repaired and he said well this lazy rushes did not doubt even care about a repair and i was so angry when i heard it because of course there is nothing to be partly

1145.07,1159.68, for me well when i made the picture i never thought of that that when i saw back it was for me something that really said something about my feeling in life a dead moment i felt very
1160.01,1171.05, no and wanted some one to hold and i mean sometimes it happens like that well it is on an appin an airport
