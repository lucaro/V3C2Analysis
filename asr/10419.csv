6.99,11.49, in name is keith johnson i'm a professor of agronomy
11.91,15.6, the forage extension specialist of proteins
15.6,43.02, and it is my great pleasure to provide all you watching this wolgast to day information about sam us a by energy of this is an i was state university based yousta national institute of food and agriculture spots of research project that is investigated the creation of midwestern sustainable boils by product systems
43.71,46.62, website sense
47.13,58.14, i waited not to show the work of this project with every one interested in producing advanced transportation fields
58.32,68.25, i products developed for premisses grown on land unsuitable for four or marginal for rowcroft production
68.61,71.28, our best to day
71.55,78.18, after a mental who as a research and bodies with the united states department of agriculture
78.18,80.28, research service
80.46,84.6, within the week sartin and for her search in it
84.63,87.0, the university of nebraska lincoln
87.42,93.18, a second as is doctor michael paler he is a research plainness
93.36,100.2, what the use agricultural search service and university of wisconsin out of madison wisconsin
101.58,105.63, an opening question for all of you gentlemen is
105.69,109.11, grasses a good candidate
109.29,111.42, feet to
111.51,114.48, his wants are the strongest candidates
117.51,120.12, no tariff
123.18,128.91, we're looking at some of these potential biology feet stocks the printers as make a lot of sense in that
129.0,144.99, as they can be planted once and harvest it hartson for a number of years and we have studied in the ground now that have been ere now in her twentieth harvester on those particular trial so they can be planted once and be grown reallotment of their manage well
145.05,149.31, secondly there is productive on martyrous cropland
149.37,166.86, one of the areas that we've been focusing the printing grassinis at markelov rogron might be might be so being might be that certitude grass land area that people picture they might be wet or they might have some issues with size or difficult to get into some of our
167.01,172.92, large modern machinery and so are they fit well in those marly productive sits because they
172.92,177.3, do pretty well with the lower quality soil
177.36,181.74, provide some opportunities were recrossing be the best option
182.01,187.53, you know it then like not to angostura to several years
187.53,193.62, these runners to get established and to get the full potential
193.83,206.7, and without reboso truth best management practices or follow in planning for in establishing these grasses what needs to be considered to improve the success rate of establishing
206.73,211.08, these grasses that we focused on the most witchgrass
212.04,218.7, really good point you know over the past decade or two we really made spirometer areas
218.79,220.2, the equipment
220.29,231.45, got better equipment to plant some of these progresses we also got better heresie options and those two things really given us good opportunities for success from planets pannonian grasses
231.63,239.22, as we look at those those issues really some of the some of the things are show up for us or
239.22,245.1, in the ground at the right time and at the right depth and then managing weeds in the timely manner
245.34,249.36, some of the questions that we get pretty regularly are
249.48,260.07, one i planted with grass well from a tiny perspective for us and we really focus on about two to three weeks before or after the recommended for planting date in an area
260.13,265.74, i felt true very well throughout the world really where we recommend it with presented
265.8,268.98, a good solid recommended for planting at an area
269.04,286.47, weeks before to george three weeks after really gives these pretty grasses which grass included a good opportunity for success in getting established that's wonderful that's really wonderful because it does give them a great length of time in an we're talking about forty six weeks which is a really wide wide window
288.27,301.83, the other things are we get questions about how should i prepare the seed bed well if you've got an opportunity to plan ahead and can the year before you planning to plant the prioress of wit that are in round a pretty soybeans
302.28,308.49, a great a great seed bed for no till seating which grassette final grasses
308.52,316.38, complaint so i bent the year before great weak control opportunities very nice seat beddgelert
316.5,320.1, prepare to see manitoba lot of trash like in
320.19,338.61, order or some sort of rome thing like that if you kind of get your mind to prepare the seat but like you went for now felt a stand it's a pretty good way to think about it a switch grass is pretty small seated that probably two hundred fifty to four hundred thousand seats for found within switch grass so it's really a small seed
338.67,350.04, the books most of the books will probably tell you sends for pontresina i yet see that a sealth's pretty close there's a lot of seeds is a big point and it's a small seed
350.28,353.55, planning the seat at the right time and at the right depth
353.79,360.15, our modern planters we are no children we have available to us most of those can be equipped with the bands
360.39,371.64, and we can put it death and one a note till drill and really control the death of that seat placement and has really critical for us i really want that seemed to be planted only about a quarter to half an inch deep
371.7,380.88, you get a much deeper than that that's really a big issue for us in getting that that the emerging seedling up above the ground giving an opportunity to succeed
382.56,393.51, one is a weak control and so for us it especially through much of the central plains and midwest grass weeds end up being one of our biggest problem for establishments success
393.69,397.65, have some pretty good heriots for controlling the grassy weeds
397.68,402.69, and right now fasten all as one is labeled in a lot of states
402.75,408.21, so we can play apply a primer and application of fastening
408.3,411.18, really good job of controlling those grass weeds
411.24,416.94, usually from most of our areas by around the fourth of july will start to see the broadly we problems show up
417.03,422.4, the point really is a good time for us in general that think about proudly we control so
422.61,429.72, for this area but we end up doing is a preferential cation of fatal for controlling the grass weeds
431.46,435.6, in that scene the ground for a definite right time and then
435.75,448.14, and then come back some round the fourth of july and apply broadly we control with two forty and a switch grass and most of these dainty pretty warm susan brassiere two four devery very well
448.17,468.9, you can use some pretty high rates to learn back broadly fetishes but the nature earlier or gold now in establishing his form season brasses is not just to get seedlings tostevin that first year really argolander realistic bolus here is to put that seasoned and by day into that first growing season have heard parsifal
468.9,473.61, harvesting lapageria from the field in that first year planning
473.61,478.8, on this a lot of places on this at my own place i even after frost
478.83,490.17, antonine replanning so it's you do things right at the right time really opportunity for success is very very high and then by the end of that
490.23,493.98, next in season were pretty close to fullerton
494.31,504.33, these are great depths then if we look at them the greatest concerns of water the things that you've seen a camp cause the greatest failures
505.23,511.08, really for us the big deals are when i go look at stands its usually they planted it too late
511.17,513.39, or they planted the seeds to need
514.68,529.89, for weeks control especially on the grassy weeds and suasion of those three things that lead to a horse stand success in that planning year and quite often it's that planning too late it's hard for me relating people to plant these wares and brass too early
529.92,536.73, some areas they recommend proceeding so proceeding after in november
537.18,545.64, do that here because we have really good success in our area by planting in the spring but if you get that season the ground early i like them and apartment that in the april for us
545.88,553.11, as a really nice time we get really reliable rains and that's really critical for us is as that so tempers warming up that we get
553.14,557.58, keep the soil where people seedlings eliphalet not really fragile stage
557.88,559.8, very good
559.92,570.6, you know one of the things that we need to think about them and moving to dorales called archie an important part of the management as well
570.66,581.64, even reading with grass a big blue stem for use in a future boast energy industry and one has been the major goal of your program
582.06,591.48, okay thanks i actually that's a very simple question the answer we really have one main goal and that's the gift attentive prayer
591.54,603.12, reason i use that number reason i have chosen that goal is because all the economic life cycle analysis modeling studies have shown
603.12,611.67, are yields are really not quite high enough to be economically sustainable yet there right on the margin
611.97,616.32, a really really good producer asked the experience
616.38,632.55, can produce economic yields of switch grass or for viomesnit now but we want to get that kilpont where its higher where more people can feel comfortable having economically sustainable held
632.64,642.87, our main goal the increase yield and yet the ten cents per acre by about the year twenty five twenty five twenty twenty five or twenty
643.53,663.87, kagwantans i have joyed about being part of the sinus a project is looking at the diversity of witch grass ah it's in my opinion it's just quite amazing and i enjoy going out to feel every time i do to look at this great diversity 
663.99,676.41, so you have been using the genetic diversity attributes to cheer goals of that ten ton production so what attributes to these different types half
677.28,689.85, i share your enthusiasm about that i've been doing this for twenty years and i'm still as enthusiastic maybe even more so than when i started out i spent a lot of fun
690.3,697.47, boil it down very simply there are two types of witches there's what we call the upland by and what we call the lowly
697.83,707.61, this part of the country the north central united states a few go out to native prairies and semanticist em where you see switch transferring
707.61,713.88, places where it's been for thousands of years that's all what we call the planchette
713.91,721.35, very short very early flowering it's a good forage and we've been using it as a borrow
721.41,730.53, his colleagues in the great plains of the musing his forage for a long long time sixty seventy years since they started breeding for varieties
732.03,737.91, a good basis flowers in early august
738.09,740.1, in this part of the country
740.43,743.88, once it flowers it stops accumulating violets
743.88,750.9, so when you think about that is actually about five or six weeks left in the growing season where it's not a complaining bien
751.14,754.74, temperatures are still warm enough that it could still be growing
755.43,759.99, we've been focusing on is this thing called the lowland type
760.29,766.26, you look for the lowland papenoo at what they are their characteristics and where you find them
766.59,772.56, a little bit of an issue which really for me is just the challenge of my reader
772.65,776.19, it was all the lowland pico from the southern united states
776.46,783.93, and they're very pall their very very late flower so if you bring them up here and you can get them to survive
784.26,789.06, for about four to six weeks later than the amplitude
789.15,792.45, i mean they're actually utilizing the entire growing seat
792.75,795.93, robin his colleagues in nebraska
795.96,799.95, can grow a few of the low and types in the brass
799.98,803.97, an upset climate is warm enough that
804.0,812.49, thus with the point where they can grow some of the northern adapted lowland types from southern bassianus roma
812.94,820.71, get up into our part of the country minnesota iowa wisconsin illinois and farther east
820.89,827.25, which is not a part of the same region or central region we can't grow the lowest
827.37,831.99, so what we've been focusing on keith we've been bringing these low and populations
832.08,835.29, to the northern united states into which god
835.65,837.87, her reading program is located
838.26,842.94, we've been growing tens of thousands of plans of many many exceptions
842.94,847.2, we don't know the right exceptions we don't know which one for going to be the most inert
847.38,850.86, please plants and we let nature take its course
851.07,854.22, and what nature does it kill most of them
854.4,858.21, and that's exactly what we want we dig up the survivors
858.24,865.02, and we then intercross those survivors and of course that's not the easiest thing to do because they don't
865.17,869.01, for a wisconsin but they won't produce see here cousin
869.07,874.38, so that's one of the things where tenuous as been very very helpful to us
874.41,882.93, as our tenuous collaborator illinois has been very willing to work with us so every spring what we do as we think up all of our survivors
882.96,894.36, mortimer he cried down to illinois and we plant them in a field at the university illinois and then we go back down in not september october and we harvest seat from 
894.39,914.91, we go through generations several generations like that than to be able to increase the war heartiness of the low type so essentially what we're doing this were developed in northern adapted late flowering loathes i just finding that late flowering trade for the wearisomeness
915.0,917.88, now averaged a
918.93,939.87, it's a process and what is the amount of time and effort that it takes to do all of this you talked about taking it from wisconsin down to illinois beatable to develop the seed and so forth he doesn't just happen a matter of a year does
940.17,957.54, no no it's so we can go through a generation of selection in about a three year period we have to start receiving with star with seeds that we collected in the sun in its state we generate sealing thplendid hearing wisconsin
957.96,965.79, all goes well and the first winner is a really harsh winter and it kills a lot of our plans and we can make selections redward
966.15,971.82, mild winter then we may have to wait another year so we get that selection pressure
971.88,974.94, that wintered till off most of our plans
975.24,985.11, so usually they'll go through two winters when up the survivor to drive down to one and then we produce the sea of that that a three year period
985.47,1001.34, with data that we have so far we think it takes about three generations to get enough concentration of the genes that control weariness to be able to have a new variety at least a new candidate variety
1001.46,1005.36, as the winter artiste can basis yes we
1005.39,1008.39, we really feel competent to the north
1008.45,1021.2, right there that's nine years you know not in years from the time that we collect them the seed and insight mississippi or alabama or texas where generations of selection
1021.41,1024.11, we've got a bag of sea that
1024.11,1028.04, entree generations of selection we feel pretty confident
1028.16,1029.12, and
1029.18,1032.96, one more challenged we've got to do some testing and many locations
1033.23,1037.28, that's where senussis really been valuable to us
1037.31,1042.47, as one of the hall marks of the senate project as he had this mutilation
1042.5,1048.62, on trailing system thirteen occasion were wegetable to test a lot of ore
1048.86,1067.94, well let's take a look let's take a look in at some of the success that you've had it you know you've got a graphic there looks at over the course of so fine a and differences in your development so take a through the progression of yielding prevent
1068.39,1075.35, the only day that i have share with right now keith is so is the slide the turfing to
1075.41,1093.44, population that we call spoilt its centrifuge eration of selection and you can see were comparing it in wisconsin to the northern atlantic isolate call a northern lowland type and you can see the average
1093.44,1096.41, i yield is about seventy two per cent
1096.83,1105.32, and that population actually seems to have enough when the artists that it seems to survive fairly well for us over a twothree period
1105.5,1109.79, expectation is still survive longer than two or three years
1109.85,1112.88, because we did have some pretty hard winters
1112.91,1115.01, that's 
1115.46,1121.91, to gain that we can expect this around that percent increase as a result of 
1122.48,1136.82, just phenomenal i mean that's just great but then thinking about this have you learned anything in all of this research that you had done doctor caserta pitfalls or potential problems
1136.85,1138.47, she with
1138.5,1140.03, these developments
1140.6,1144.08, unfortunately he we have
1144.14,1152.69, a couple of things that we didn't think about when we started this whole process but they come to mind that they promote for
1152.81,1158.03, there's a lot of discussion right now but it requires there's a
1158.3,1166.58, a large group of people that would really like to see us we ourselves away from nathan fertilization of these violent grasses
1166.97,1172.22, in his correction rob but i think it's the single
1172.52,1174.29, large expense
1174.32,1177.89, producing bile mass from a perennial
1178.34,1183.89, and we'd like to see if we can figure out how to reduce that or eliminate that
1184.07,1188.12, problem is if we increase held by percent
1188.21,1199.94, increasing the iceman by almost seventy per cent as well because what happens is you you end up drawing more nitocris and urge that increased by one
1200.03,1201.05, so
1201.05,1212.6, a long term goal actually trying to figure out how to develop with grass varieties that have a lower nightman we know we can do that
1212.63,1218.54, going to be a long term goal it's not going to happen in the next five to seven or ten years
1218.93,1223.07, going to take about years to develop new varieties that have
1223.58,1231.41, significantly lower exit so in the meantime that's one potential disadvantages we increase the night
1231.56,1245.27, the other is something kind of interesting my engineering college me hard time they say that it's goin to cost more energy or require mariners to harvest these grasses something i never really thought of
1245.45,1253.1, at that but i think they're probably right is a lot more biassou there than there used to be
1253.97,1278.39, a very very interesting and just the continued need to foul with research from things we learned from a search that were doing currently is just really critical to make this the best that a compassable so imprecate mentioning those potential issues a notorious in the doctor mechanisme data that doctor katisha
1278.54,1289.76, you are from a dry water violent than doctor caller in wisconsin being from nebraska and what types of old have you achieved
1289.94,1295.34, the great planes and then when as this hearsay occur
1296.45,1306.62, question you know what the sinuous a project one of the things that we started doing is it gave us the opportunity to plant some of his betrayal of the fields pale
1306.86,1310.34, that's all been a benefit to us is to have
1310.34,1316.82, enough material that we plant at the field scale and harvest it was with typical of a harvesting equipment
1316.88,1325.1, and kind of going back to some of what mike said one of the issues that i didn't anticipate is amount of material that were leaving in the field
1325.25,1331.85, we were saying this material kind of being forced through our typical he handling equipment
1331.88,1340.16, back to some of the comments that the engineering armadas that it really is a lot of material the handle at one time and so that
1340.22,1351.23, a lot of leaves showing a lot loss so we can actually go back through those windows and and sort out how much we've left in the field just because it is a lot of stuff to deal with
1351.32,1355.73, so that's an issue that kind of gets back to that question yes my
1355.94,1360.17, we kind of think about where we'd been at
1360.17,1364.37, the past years or so working on these prating ogresses and where we are now
1364.73,1366.83, there's no something for nothing
1366.83,1374.09, as indicating when golong term studies were a god cronion fifty five pounds of action
1374.18,1379.01, and then underhanded ten pounds of agrotera
1379.22,1381.05, zero in plots
1381.26,1390.53, very importantly productive so they've been a push that to say what these natives that they don't need nitrogen to put exaggeration but fertilize them just
1391.82,1393.68, make it on their own well
1393.89,1401.66, very poorly and some of the data window you in about one and a half tons breaker a ten year yield average
1401.72,1416.33, we now have about years of hell beyond that particular study in referring to but as you start to fly in a little more nitriary a nice increase in annedotos particular witch grass plants
1416.54,1427.91, it does respond pretty nicely to nitrogen we have historically probably over fertilized and kind of the the old rate sweeping ting from a yield perspective
1428.12,1432.26, for us in the great plains here
1432.47,1438.35, five to six on range we probably really need me putting on at least fifty pounds of nitrate breaker
1438.41,1441.86, a kind of what our researches old demonstrate
1441.95,1445.58, side of that is you ask the question about when should we harvest it
1446.81,1452.3, probably smiled just like mad because it depends what he want to use the material for
1452.3,1457.28, you want to use the material for for he forgot
1457.49,1464.24, suggest parts that first of all i guess we can do in this area first of august as about our pentuer
1464.39,1467.09, so he harvested those
1467.57,1472.97, pentecostyes like migratories like shone
1473.21,1483.59, around the first of august for us in maximis that gildonian but also a kind of optimists with that the equality or inquit
1483.59,1493.25, we can provide a quality had with a risible yield as a good forage for live stock now you folks in on by energy one of the things that we've
1493.25,1498.56, with harvesting but my energy as were much better served to harvester killing brass
1498.68,1501.2, the harvest after frost
1501.23,1506.75, a couple of advantages one it gives us a really nice advantage of maintaining stands
1506.75,1509.69, a quality stands with a lower nitrogen rate
1509.9,1523.34, we don't have some of the invasion problems from the cool season brasses that we see throughout a lot of our area ormandine blue grass and bates pretty readily and so if we are an atropos we don't see so much of that invasion issue
1523.58,1528.86, as a really nice job of giving us an opportunity to re cycle mitten back into the system
1528.92,1543.56, i talked about nitrogen as a huge input into the production of these frigates in indian do that reduces that night riprisint is a great thing for us so by delaying harvest until after frost were cycle a lot of it and back into the
1543.56,1560.3, and portion of the plan which gives us now an opportunity to realize that the next rise we iolanthe observations i've had in the work here in indiana is that when you do exceed you know that sixty pound and nitrogen breakin of rate
1560.33,1570.86, major windstorm with hide nitrogen and lodge that crop and that reliantly to some major harvesting issues in a lot of outcrop in the field
1572.06,1587.0, and harvest was material i agree so that's moontalk of that about as betrothing thinks charrging the post establishment vestment of productive producing switch grass
1592.82,1596.18, in that keith i'm sorry okay
1597.92,1609.44, so lapointe resting data that's looking at the post establishment investment that a producer will have when producing switch grass to what at some of the current production costs
1610.76,1621.56, as we think about what it costs for us to grow which grass incineration one of the things that we can do as we can we can mortise those statesmen cost over a number of years and for us
1621.74,1630.95, a very realistic worse to have a standing production one of the trials i have mentioned earlier was planted in nineteen ninety eight it still going strong
1630.95,1637.91, i got some other studies that were planted two thousand six that were we harvested it for by mass a hour grazing
1638.12,1639.83, kind of a purpose
1639.86,1654.29, i think keep these stands in production heresy preten years with some good management so as we look at these talismen cost one of the things we do as we amortized that out over ten years because it really does a nice job of spreading out the cost of establishment
1654.74,1664.61, as i mentioned earlier new look at mittenmeyer it does require an i toted typically we can look at for us about thirty dollars
1664.7,1669.11, race is what we anapaestic in nitrogen
1669.23,1674.69, and then when the other down side is microsoft with yield as he goes up
1674.78,1698.03, he doesn't go up but your cost obeying goes up because you putting up more bales so that's another interesting issue than that lot of people don't think about us more in produce more valsugana it the more that costs so from other and postproduction prospect he really were looking at a kind of a target yield in that five or six hundred which is really very table for us in an eastern nebraska growing the stuff dry land
1698.06,1723.5, or production costs again depending on the land costs and that's really the bigger i repress southerland but if we look at a reasonable reasonable cost of land in our area of about a hundred and fifty dollars for artassumara again were focusing on more personal productive crop lands in the cheaper rate we can really do a pretty good job of growing witch grass and that sixty five to seventy dollars per ton range
1723.65,1734.33, a producer an opportunity then to make some revenge some of those targets of eighty five hundred dollars a ton were looking at for mastery a sale price
1734.87,1742.01, do you have any projection on the amount of production necessary for a full production facility to operate
1743.27,1749.87, you look a basically at a cancale that's required for many of these enomoties to be
1749.87,1756.35, productive and profitable the target has kind of historically been about fifty million gallons per year
1756.62,1759.44, to provide enough feed stock to
1759.47,1763.37, one fifty million gallon saloon plant
1763.4,1765.71, days a year
1765.83,1775.31, takes a lot of material and so produce them back adulating and saying in a tone which grass for example we can produce about eighty gallons of ethandune
1775.67,1779.0, do the moth on the fifty million gallon plan
1779.18,1788.12, inspiration to need about six hundred and twenty five thousand tons of material to meet that feedstock to man what's up
1788.42,1790.07, the whole bunch of material
1790.13,1794.42, so not only as an old much material i take quite a bit of land
1794.78,1797.63, about earlier you know yield is the key
1797.84,1801.38, if we look at some of those real or yielding
1801.68,1816.95, and low yield the management practices if you're only in that one to two tons baker you're looking at a fourth the half of the land area in a twenty five mile radius round so those together all plant having to be in a princess to provide enough each stock and that is his
1817.07,1820.49, right we don't even think along those lines
1820.67,1835.52, we start getting into those five six seven eight one ranges now it really only takes me about between seven and ten per cent of the land to be in production around that saliently to produce no feedstock to run that plan
1838.88,1842.63, look at that on a daily basis it
1842.69,1843.92, i
1843.95,1848.66, shows us how staggering really the amount of material required is because
1848.75,1854.54, if you look in that sons of peace talk needed for years to run one of these facilities
1854.63,1858.65, being about the sons of material is needed for month
1860.06,1866.72, on that and that's about times per day and if you're going five tons a biass race
1866.72,1872.57, takes about three hundred forty acres which grass a day to run that facility which is
1872.9,1875.09, armand
1875.18,1877.22, the kind of but that
1877.55,1879.44, soon the line
1879.44,1889.37, allowing any one trucks a day and so that's a lot of trucks coming into facility providing boomayahmayahmul
1889.76,1893.15, kind of put that football fan being from nebraska
1894.56,1896.75, that of the football
1898.79,1901.46, so much material just for a month
1901.64,1904.52, basically covers a football field
1904.58,1915.14, about thirty feet if he makes assumptions of fifteen thousand forfeited thirty three feet so that's a big pile of material to the
1915.23,1921.29, by that much mimesis really a big chore so it is it's not an easy thing
1922.58,1952.73, in that amount of land is certainly an interesting thing and we don't have time to go into specific but i thought conversation and things that i've seen for you about the corners of the centripetal plans as an opportunity there to get an amount of acreage that could be an opportunity because of course they're not underrating and then from the standpoint of marginalia consideration
1954.26,1966.23, well let's say the kind of bring my back and rob and i think we're a point to finish up this web cast you have any closing comments gentlemen
1969.05,1973.64, i think that about some paint the commenting else so gay from
1974.51,1993.02, prettilove keith thanks again for the opportunity to share some more information with you with all its been a real pleasure for me to spend the time with two individuals i have great respect for a new enarea part of the same project and thank you again very much for sharing at your great expertise thank you
1993.32,1995.03, thank you
