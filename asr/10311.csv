0.21,75.87, i did run in our gallery for so long because i really don't like galleries and i don't think that they are as effective as they could be in terms of providing a cultural service to our society the art world is a very close world that doesn't affect many people i think that that i'm part of a generation who is not afraid of doing many things coming out of a generation of people who are very focus on my pedometer there's an overarching word that i would be for everything i would say artist i preferred to deliver messages if i can and in that and more mainstream way like other great of people that to work in a lot of different mediums everything informed everything else that's what artesian weatherstone teller people of the our world and you know whether you're doing you know a record amaazin a file or a painting it is religious story telling one of the things i love about sam radiate what towers was it his real motivation for building these was to make something that never existed before in the world rob
