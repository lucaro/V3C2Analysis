60.63,117.99, the first things one of the first things we started to notice was shown for the first year and a half of his life he was developing normally he had language then at about eighteen months he reversed and he became non verbal and he started doing repetitive behaviors we didn't think automat first we have other friends who have kids with speech slashes sometimes it's just one of those things it means nothing and with shawhan was funny as he doesn't have enough criteria for any one disorder he didn't have enough of the classic features of artists artisans whatsoever
118.11,127.17, we had to see months he tied his six only sixteen months younger than shantied debater was not verbal
127.5,138.96, so we just did the same thing again just a lot of cheap certainly isn't going to hurt them you know so we just went through the same thing and just as
139.32,178.56, and then we took time to the neurologist he was given an official on tim diagnosis is classic both of them were you know constantly going to different positions in the house carrying things existing to a lot of tossing loud they'll grab ador and slammed against guarantees of the door hitting the wall but no imaginative play that that's another strange feature no shanter and he's starting to engage in imaginative play and he has tom as thomas the train and active things elitha was a big relief to start to see him use imagination and
178.86,188.94, one farewell either what i dare

202.32,224.22, he taking he can do stacking when you i'll take the black and kind of put him in front of himself that one of us kind of put it on the top he'll take the next one and stacked that was a big break through for us just because he was constantly just run around doing his own little thing but when they got him to sit still and start stacking things and listening to them
224.28,226.11, we knew we were getting to him
226.2,235.59, we just kept you know more and more therapy coming to him to help him out and he will listen after you see his name unfortunately about four or five times but
236.22,248.46, now i am sure is a myth he is obsessed with mats and reading he uses renumber and letters
248.46,254.31, actually he when at school his mat skills
254.49,271.62, they were going to get some text books for him and a computer software for a third or fourth grade level and he's in cresco
271.95,317.31, i wanted to put him in was a classroom of completely non verbal children she is he's verbal so i didn't think that that would be beneficial to him to be in a completely non verbal class i don't believe in luring the bar believe in raising it but the school district did admit to us later that that will is the chiefest for them so they always suggest the cheapest school first and then if the parents are unhappy and try to fight it then all sudden bullshit more expensive schools which really isn't fair is if we hadn't fought if we hadn't gotten angry about it they just would have euphemisms each
318.09,348.33, are going to suffer as a parent and i'm sure all parents feel this way whether their kids are special enter not i'm not going to live forever timepiece i need to know what i'm going to do my best to get them to a place where they can have a good life without me here to afore them and that's especially scary thing when you do have a child with disabilities is that you do wrytha's going to happen on minute

406.47,420.75, it could be anywhere from one time we up to hours a week depended on the child's needs pending on how severe so it is really completely based on each individual child
422.76,426.81, oh you got the highest number
435.24,442.5, sometimes when we are doing work or he is just not as engaged as i would like him to be
442.68,471.63, and i'll make a game out of it all emotion and i'll give his body squeezes that's what the rest sully call it and i'll squeeze his legs all the way up and i squeezed his arms all the way up to his shoulders and he really likes getting pressed pressed in the head if he is on focusing on engaged the second i do this just push at it he totally relaxes and he just
472.26,483.96, love it sometimes i'll swing him back and forth with his speech there this to get him engaged and his asnore more more and also with all these
484.71,521.28, things that need and his sensory needs they promote engagement and he likes it so he needs to ask for more so it's also great and communication in to do like that ah you want me to do it again yeah okay what do you say bateese dinner back i want to do upside down monkey is so when he wants something his communication is awesome so the this thesis a drill in the via program its listening for absurdities a telligence
