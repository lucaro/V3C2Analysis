0.27,10.77, mame is charles more i was a world war to firio
11.52,15.39, flo and england and france
15.75,24.06, few of unabateable had an eighteen cylinder two thousand horse power engine it
24.39,65.94, had four fifty caliber machine guns and each wing so a total of eight guns under each way now that pillowed hang as much as a thousand pound bomb a five hundred pound on the belly and in the way we carried four thousand rounds of armor piercing and send a fifty caliber bullet like that one of these things will go all away through an automobile including the engine and start a fire when you squeeze the trigger to fire the guns all eight guns fired at once and you put out ninety six of those a second something in front of you is going get hurt real bad
66.09,71.13, there's a railroad on the ground down there with a train on the track
71.46,77.64, there is the engine those little white spots you see right in the cab as the engine
77.67,81.78, our bullets from all eight of my gun came to a point
81.93,87.3, the thing beginning to explode it's unlikely that anyone survived that
87.84,95.4, i fired that first in coming at it out here about five hundred feet above the ground at three hundred miles an hour
95.58,112.89, yards in front of my airplane and all it took the blow that engine up wasn't even a one second birth is like god and it all over that's the remains of a german marshalling yard they brought the box cars in loaded him up
113.16,129.24, i can took him out this photograph was taken by a very low flying he thirty eight photo recon airplane for hours after we went by and died both place let me explain i bombay we did it
129.6,141.75, in the pews the biggest heaviest fighter of world war two when you got to know is down on it the deceleration with extreme recorders more due
141.84,147.18, never started below eight thousand feet and dived a forty five degree angle
147.45,150.48, and treated almost two miles up
150.63,163.11, you drop a bomb to miles up in the manlike that you have no idea where it's going to hit the ground so our squadron commander major ralph jenkins experimented around and came up with this idea
163.26,189.51, at the point of that bulletin the target we were tried toward the target not at eight thousand feet but at five thousand and you rode on your back like that and went right straight down adjust your ditto get the dog of your gun side on the target relief the bombs and then poured out of the diodati way we would be down about seven hundred feet at four hundred miles an hour
189.66,192.36, to that prayer your hard to hit
192.6,197.52, we didn't lose anybody down here and we also never had one plan to the target
197.76,208.92, the accuracy of our tax improved into where it was not unusual to see a guy roll on his back and died down in a pair of bogtrotter tank like that
209.73,212.01, this is also what we would do
212.7,240.48, what if a german troop train carrying soldiers there isn't much left the box cars were steel frame with wood sighing and to one we would hang a hundred gallon tank a gasoline on the belly of a hair plain fly about fifty feet over the top of it and dropped the tank on it it would burst and splattering all over that wooden box car and the following fighter would shoot it said it on fire to burn everything 
243.84,256.65, this is a drifting photograph at the picture of the five tenth fighter squadron that i flew with assembled for take off june sixth nineteen forty four that damning
256.89,265.26, we can let picture and we could get all twelve of them in the air in about three to three and a half minutes
265.89,268.92, was the air for we flew off of an
269.07,271.08, the south coast of england
271.35,273.81, the shore line the white cliff
274.08,275.79, there is the runway
277.08,288.3, the order for a p called for a minimum of five thousand feet of concrete patron way that four thousand five hundred feet of wire mesh
288.57,299.31, the real fellows nicolette village of muddy ford one day to my pilot bunnies and i were walking right down here
299.61,306.42, and watching one of the other squadrons in the group take off in one of their planes got up about their engine quit
306.66,311.49, down at the top of a house crashed in there and mercantile
311.82,321.9, the neighbors around there did what people anywhere would do they all came running down to look at the wreck we knew there were three five hundred pound bombs in that fire
322.05,335.88, we were running down there to warn the people and chase him away we got about a seventy five or a hundred feet away from the booth fired one of those bombs cooked off
337.17,343.5, the gun next to me arthur williams was from kansas he was about arms length away
344.1,350.61, reacted about so big intimate chain went right through he was killed right there
351.09,356.85, on the other side of me had a piece of shrapnel hits her hat took hunkie
357.09,363.9, recently retired as president the americans of the south carolina senate senator john drummond
364.32,367.65, get badly heard i got skinned up a little bit
367.83,371.82, he introduced to the concussion from an explosion like that
371.91,382.29, there were people killed her and i'm walking around in the middle of that carnegie where i was or what a world i was doing after the norman invasion
382.38,387.39, a figure group moved across the english channel to france
387.39,392.58, we flew off of in france is even more ridiculous than this one in need
394.14,410.31, is a british victoire doing a bun job over our runway this runway all show it wasn't made of concrete it was one that made out of what would call hastening a heavy weight tarpaper
410.73,416.7, addition to that it was not five thousand feet long it was three thousand eight hundred feet long
417.51,422.28, the overloaded the airplane and still got the thing off the ground
422.4,433.17, end of the runway locked your breaks open the throttle wide open and turned it loose my description was when i began to feel life in the wings
433.2,435.69, just pull the lantern
435.87,439.62, raccoons too much friction
439.89,447.42, the man at her introduce that friction the wheels started up but pull the nose up and climbed out
449.52,450.93, looked like that
452.25,460.35, you can leave the ground of hundred and fifty two hundred feet from the end of the run way which you see way back there
461.67,462.63, he
462.99,465.12, i want to talk about this
466.59,469.83, our engineers this is an apple of a
470.01,481.05, our engineers moved into that apple orchard with a bunch of boors and went through just uprooting trees showed the log out of the way filled the holes in
481.23,485.82, it down and laid his hastening the heavy weight tarpaper
488.04,502.38, moved in with shooters and two and a half days later delivered an airfield ready to fly on foot and that included the taxi strips to move the airplanes and the hard sand depart
503.79,506.73, something oneadatote
506.73,511.11, the liver an airfield in two and a half days is remarkable
512.16,515.79, a picture of them lay in the hesitating
515.79,520.92, pull on agathemer together localise had been locked
521.1,523.62, poor motto
524.01,545.16, and then before we started flying off on that day too the trees out water have fancy living quarters you did your balingasag out of your steel helmet you got some water heating in a bucket back here on an open fire at the pretty primitive living this is also how we live
545.4,547.23, couple of my buddies
547.47,625.74, sandy johnston getting a new hair to and had he wished it done the barbering wasn't a barber he was a florentine service did the matter he is chopping her off we lived in the tent he seated in the trees there somewhat longer hanging on a tree branch back there pretty primitive one day there is a young girl she's about fourteen year old kid standing in the weeds out there our flight surgeon domitian went out and pechorin's her what are you doing here you are right in the middle of a combat outfit the girl explained she hoped when we finished a meal if there's any food left she could take some o her family because they were hungry the war and killed all their animals torn up their garden so they couldn't grow any thing this is an apple orchard no fruit on the trees and they were afraid to get on the road to look for food because if they did their likely to get killed our orders were you catch anything on the rails of the road moving you shoot it our mess sergeant charles he said do you go tell girl to come back with her family the melody will take care of them as long as we stay here so we had guests for our penitentiaries
625.95,665.73, a sergeant saying came to me then he said captain would you do me a favor a sure short whatever you want on the wings on the pile on under the wangara the tank we on bones we could also hang external field thanks to extend the range of the airplane one type of those tanks were made by the english they held a hundred and eight gallons and were made of paper my chewin was liquid proof for maybe three hours sergeant sank mixed up seventy gallons of powdered milk jumped in twenty gallons of make fruit cocktail
665.73,685.71, pound of sugar three gallons of calvados a good tasting apple brandy he made in that orchard country few other spices got it all mixed up real good parted one of those paper tanks hung it on my airplane and said now take that upward it really gets cold so i took off and climbed up
685.8,692.76, see where the outside air temperature is forty five to fifty degrees below zero
692.88,695.19, no free that makes you pretty quick
695.4,726.15, the play around like that about a half hour to try to keep it turned up rolled over and dived down and landed they dropped the tape from the wing cropped it open with an ax and we enjoyed tootity ice cream now that was expensive ice cream because the engine in that thing burdened gallian hour of a hundred and fifty of tangerina crushing three hundred gallons at power weingarten anticlinal head like cream
726.42,764.82, in that part of france up in the brit matermony are the farmers did separate their fields with fencing like ours do they built a barn a mounted dirt planted trees and bushes on it and that's what separated their fields as the dark lines some of those have been there longer united states has been a country and their real solid and pindar soldiers down a ground soldier looking over the top of one of those is likely to get it had blown off by a sniper when our tax tried to run through that the grown up over a burn the belly exploded exposed and they got hit by a rocket
765.54,779.82, out of there they send a bunch of heavy bombers be seventeen and beth twenty four and they just blew out about a five mile square wiped out everything in there and our tanks got through that opening into flat country
779.85,781.62, south of the heroes
781.65,797.64, our troops landed up in norman americans landed in utah beach omaha beach just west or east of there and general patent or general montgomery's british army landed
797.79,799.89, as
800.67,805.74, over on the east on the west side of the cotentin peninsula
805.92,817.41, here general omar bradley had the american first army montgomery on the east side of the peninsula they blew a hole of our order close to bradley
817.83,824.07, and he got his tin through that opening into flat country south of the hedgerows
824.49,828.03, he toward paris
828.12,834.78, we're flying out of saneness side of the cotentin financial
835.02,838.11, the germans are trapped between montgomery
838.2,842.82, ready and they got out of their headquarter toward 
842.85,846.84, the gather on a road
846.9,854.88, to try to escape from that pocket that pocket became known as the file pocket or the feeling
855.18,870.78, they were trying to reach the little town of eldon south of can we didn't know they were moving they got on the road at night wilanow they were moving and we took off just at dawn threw a search pattern and came across that german column
871.14,874.8, bumper enemy traffic as far as you could see
875.16,880.08, and up to the head of the column dropped a bomb on the league tank and stopped him
880.08,888.45, adequate what would found squadron reported to the group and the group at the other two squadrons on that german column
889.05,895.35, the pound stone them and created the wildest guy you can imagine
895.68,904.83, cramming up all over the place fired the next closeland down the road airplanes coming in from every direction
904.92,911.34, the radio traffic austrian among fire a valorous one hit on going down
911.4,913.53, to going back
913.56,916.8, right in the middle of that friend came a voice said
916.8,918.36, i want my mummy
918.45,922.2, you had to have a senator to survive and that environment
922.23,933.99, no our job on those bombers and was to go in ahead of the bombers and straight the antiaircraft gun you have seen pictures of streams of an aircraft fire coming up
934.17,937.65, down into that is a really dangerous business
938.1,940.92, you see they're only one pilot and a fighter
940.92,946.83, an airplane is vegetables fighter with one man than a bomber was ten men
946.98,955.05, we went down a head to strathoran shot him down this is the briefing for that mission
955.35,972.42, going to talk about dead men they were not all killed on the one mission this guy commanded one of the other squadrons in our group that's my quadrumane major bruce parcel he was killed next to him as me i wasn't killed
973.71,985.5, pelleas killed kelly was killed michael regan survived he was killed that cat is my best buddy ben savage who was killed at jacotot
986.25,989.22, the recognizable people in that picture
989.22,990.45, i
990.87,992.31, something that
992.79,1018.02, don't understand about the loss of life in world war i most everybody is familiar with the marine one will jim and it was a slaughter all right but the highest law rat that is the percentage killed relative to the numbers involved were the submarine crews could that draw you sing one of those you got a hundred per cent of them but the second highest late lose where the airmen
1018.11,1027.38, the four seven just eight air force flying out of england and just three years had forty seven thousand armantine
1027.8,1034.4, the bomb group of the eight air force we call him the bloody hundred
1034.49,1038.81, they took off on a mission and two hours later one airplane came back
1039.14,1050.24, that was all that came back late last thousand men on a single to our raid that on air plain believer or not was flown by aguinaldo locked
1050.45,1060.74, come in a museum case on a fourth friday of the month for our happy warriors meeting we call him lucky looked
1060.83,1071.99, on my buddy ben fallace that guy was killed we were strafing the truck convoy and he crawfished is plain and it crashed and killed him
1072.2,1096.29, we and the germans left the area the french people around here got his body out of the wreckage wrapped him in an american flag and buried him two days later in the front line had moved fast there so our flight surgeon domelike took a couple of guiding went down and dug him up and took him to the american cemetery at normandy which you see at
1096.29,1107.72, you probably think pictures of this place some of you may have been there marble crosses with stars of david for the jewish guise and beautifully landscaped
1108.32,1121.55, that's my body man sallie i took that picture forty days after the day there were six thousand four hundred graves in there they just nailed the dog takes on the crosses dragonite grave
1121.61,1131.48, took that picture there were six thousand four hundred graves right behind the tree line is omaha beach where our soldiers landed determining
1131.63,1137.57, and americans killed on that beach in one day june six nineteen forty four
1137.57,1146.15, our freedom our liberty is a very expensive proposition both in treasure and in blood
1146.36,1152.24, the folks in this country today are worth every bit of that that's my 
1152.78,1168.89, warburton said cotgrave you were just looking at you can see the size of a pea forty seven by the size of the engine carrigrohane called in her plain the red one his wife with a red head
1169.04,1175.94, one of the volunteers with the music he took these pictures about a year ago
1175.97,1181.49, my quintaner bruce parcel that's my body then savage
1182.24,1239.66, the region that place is as beautiful as it is and you can see the beautiful landscaping that land belongs to the united states it was given to this country by france so we could bury our dead in american soil but it isn't cared for by either the french or american governments it cared for by families that live around there a family will adopt five six seven graves and they take care of them and that's the reason that place is so beautiful so instead of complaining about the french all the time we all meteoric of our folks that beautifully if you want to drive about parisians that okotook anybody including other frenchmen unless they are parisians but things are the real people of france and you get in that country and let them know you're an american and you understand real quick that we are appreciated
1240.2,1253.91, that enervation of the amount of abuse that are before seven could absorb and still bring a home that's the tail of the airplane he got hit by a forty monarchal
1254.18,1260.57, that the blue a hole they are not for him to stand up in but he flew it back
1261.02,1337.16, we had another guy come back from a mission with a piece of telephone pole about that long game in the wing he hit the pole about a foot from the top and it broke off and if he came back with the head to replace the wing but i got him home my airplane got shot up on serenite mason that's the first time this is the elevator back in the tail the movable part that makes the plain go up and down i got hit by a twenty mile an aircraft shell like that the blue the hole in the tail the whole is not the problem the problem here would let big piece of metal blown down there acted as a giant trim cap and i had to planeting to climb and i had to fly it with both hands jammed against the stick to hold a note of them part of the time was my foot on it cooty five minutes of that would really worse the worst i got it i wish i had pictures of this but i don't owershot hit i'm acomin back from a mission into the rear alley and germany i'm about eight thousand feet and an eighty eight millimeter any aircraft shell blew up under the wing and rolled the plain
1337.22,1369.56, this is a millimeter and yet millimeter is about that long and when one of those things goes off the nature know it it blew up under the wing and rolled the plain i got it right and just as his next one hit the engine calling it blew a cylinder and two cylinder head off the engine and the thing kept right in for forty minutes long enough to get me behind the american lines so when i crashed i didn't get captured we got back to the little town of shell on sir man
1369.65,1374.81, grass air field east of paris where we intended to land and refuel
1375.68,1381.53, he put the landing you handed down and the right quadruped down and locked
1381.59,1409.16, couldn't get it back up because there was no hydraulic pressure which meant that i couldn't use the flap to land and there was no left landing gear at all the first shell had jammed it in the whewell we had a controller down on the ground a guy with a microphone sitting in a jean i called down an exportation to land and that controller told me i don't want that wreck on my field you go away from here and talouel come pick up
1409.67,1419.33, scared to balloon decided landed anyway i came in about a hundred and eighty five miles an hour to get set it down very gently on one wheel
1419.42,1441.41, then up as well as i could a dropped down dug into the dirt and spun the plain like that and i never got a scratch before i even the best figure playing ever built as far as i'm concerned that anastatia of the size of their plan it was the biggest fighter of wraith picture
1441.83,1447.14, right there on the wine and get lugged the size of the nose
1447.44,1449.27, you came into and
1449.33,1455.48, you made a straight an approach to the airfield like airplanes nearer local air fields
1455.51,1463.28, and here way back in the cockpit looking over that menou couldn't see the air field out there much less see a runaway
1463.34,1489.05, so you see pictures of war war i fighters coming in to land they come in lowther pealing up like that they're not hot doiteir two reasons for that one is a fighter at low altitude and low speed is very vulnerable on so we wanted to come in real fact and then tell your speed it on a ground quickly if you cut the trouble and pull it in a tight climbing turn that will
1490.82,1493.97, two we came in
1494.18,1502.16, thoomeda ely put your landing and flap and down and your landing out of a circular pattern
1502.19,1506.9, but harry your landing ears down on the back side of the turn
1506.96,1518.69, have flaps are down and you're looking at the side of the airplane looking down the wing at the runway and you get slighted sideways like that tinged cloth to the ground kicked straight and let it land
1518.81,1520.43, i worked every time
1520.52,1547.91, that's what it took to keep a pet in operation and world war i a four man crew assigned to each airplane i'm the pilot that flies in these guys don't fly they are my ground crew sergeant francis jones was the crucifix mechanic was sergeant his armor was corporal stanton who took care of the guns bombination
1548.78,1553.58, did a perfect job i never had a malfunction in any of the armament
1553.7,1560.18, one was an interesting guy he was from brooklyn the world's most accomplished driver
1560.21,1564.65, complain and griped and belabour everything all the time
1565.13,1569.93, one day and he under the way working on that bomb check or making adjustments
1569.93,1573.47, up in the capitol in the relation for him
1573.92,1588.74, a fighter came in and landed and part next to our plan the pilot dressed in the swaddling shot got out and walked by it and he looked down and he looked on at that stone and he said how are things going corporal
1588.92,1599.42, don't look up he said all they all right except the some blackened blank blank blank big shot coming in and they had a cleaning things up around here all morning
1599.54,1618.68, i said i didn't expect any special attention most stone and i look at it major general i would be a shade commander of the night's tactical air force under whose command are grouped stone recognized implicate do he jumped up and saluted
1618.98,1627.56, the general returned the salute but he made an issue of it he scowled at him and his lean in and very slowly
1627.62,1636.89, and up in his cap and held in there for a little bit and then very slowly lord in hand away and grand at him walked off
1637.49,1672.74, general aaanthor of our hero he was a quite orikama general to star he's the guy that invented the idea of supporting ground troops with fire plans he got radios and frequency in the plains in the tank so we could communicate which allowed us to attack targets close to our own troops without fair fear of killing that would general cassano need guides were absolutely heroic we could bring an airplane back all shot full of holes and by morning that thing is repaired
1672.92,1683.15, and ready to go in first class shape and they weren't in a night here for their port hanger there out in the boondocks to his flashlights
1683.48,1693.74, they took great pride in their hair plan and that was never relationship with many that would then airplane and they allowed me to fly it for him
1693.98,1707.09, i would get up on the cot partly omission charenton to get on the wing and help strategian he always said good luck captain now you take care of my airplane
1707.78,1722.39, i walked up to the plain one day sargon is up in the bucket he had tied the tail down showed couldn't bound and were running that engine wide open on an inconstant
1722.93,1733.28, yes as i walked up hegan shutting it down and he came over and he said to me i wonder what the sounds like up in the air
1733.58,1736.16, or john would you like to find out
1736.22,1749.33, sure so i took the parachute and a cushion out of the sea he sat in the seat i sat in his lap we couldn't get the seat belt around both of it but i went ahead and took off anyway
1749.75,1757.16, i got a feelin open the throttle wide open you've got two thousand horse power screaming out there
1757.49,1777.17, elsie went beyond it to the next of which turned on the water and judge he got you somewhere between three of them and five hundred more horse power and had just slayback in the seat and jones let out a yell his baby really performed and i die of the airplane and rode it
1777.74,1779.78, remember no
1781.88,1784.01, sure we like that
1784.16,1788.24, to follow out or fall into the cut
1788.36,1794.39, but a brownie winona bucket of water around do it right and could be
1794.54,1803.09, centrifugal force of keenest so that's the way i rode it like like that and not belligerent because i'm still here
1803.18,1809.27, he was the only one of my crew willing to try that that was my second airplane
1809.63,1812.33, they are both de models
1812.45,1818.9, this is the sixteenth at the depot five this we called the reader back
1818.93,1824.54, and that the bubble to a saturated same airplane except for that bubble
1824.84,1850.64, obviously the visibility out of that bubble was a whole lot better than out of the green house on the race however they a little turbulence in the slight vacuum that formed back there which flowed that model down about five miles an hour so will this one prettier this one's faster with said camarinaean
1852.47,1855.62, i want to give you an idea
1855.62,1857.36, what we accomplished
1857.51,1869.21, don't pay i'm not going to read all this i will pick and choose a few items from it in just one year we destroyed and this is destroyed damaged is another list
1869.33,1874.67, we destroyed six thousand two hundred eighty nine motor track boards that big trucks
1874.97,1877.52, battle tanks
1877.73,1880.82, railroad locomotive
1880.85,1886.67, tariro cars twenty seven bridges
1886.91,1895.58, and the artillery positions twenty three fulmination documented and forty eight railroads
