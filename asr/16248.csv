272.04,274.32, judging from
274.59,429.45, the questions come from i think that going to be quite surprised what no actually really mean to what it means to be in that position was no evil in curing man absolutely not when we look at the evidence god's word makes it crystal clear that nose are righteous man genesis chapter six versus eight nine is quote but no found favor in the eyes of the lord no it was a righteous man blameless in his time no walked with god and quoodle tells us that not as a loving man because glaciated five versi declare that faith were through love and he resarvin tells us that noah was a man of faith and i quoted by faith no obediar of things not yet seen moved with godly fear prepared an ark for the saving of his household by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith and quote did not sit in by without any caring for a warning the wicked again in true scope chapter two verse five tells us that now was quite a preacher of righteousness preachers of god's word warn people to repent that they could be seen and delivered from the wrath to come however like ravenous dogs consumed by rabies that are bent on destruction so the unrepented wicked were how ben on evil can only be condemned in the end genesis chapter six tells us that the world at that time was filled with violence secretion and that people thoughts were only evil continually which is why i'm already secundines for this floating piece of graft renounceth only one using the no movie as the kaipara of god than notoriously arrogant and spiteful atheist bill mar has used a move as a rallying point to blast famous maker god uniontown you are in a movie with russell crow and you're the one with anger issues marienkirche and twist the no astor to make a false allegation against god by claiming that god punished everybody for the wickedness of a few what in fact descriptions make it quite clear and jessica ter six or twelve that quote all the people on earth had corrupted their ways and quote what kind of tyrant punishes every one just to get back at the festally bill mark condemns the crater for judging the evil and wickedness of his creatures even though god alone has the divine right and the just duty to do so while mary himself a little creature was to see countless people killed but the thing that's really disturbing about noon
429.48,979.38, isn't he silly it's not its moral it's about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it and his name is god mars yporcrisy is absolutely chilling when he claims that he would like to see countless people killed tell alleviate what he believes to be the problem of over population i'm consistently pro death my motto is let's kill the right people i'm royce i'm for assisted suicide i'm for regular now it's an import whatever gets the freeway moment planted is too crowded and we need to promote death till the right people but i'm just no one of those people who think all life is precious you know i have but you a lot of people wouldn't say that but if your pro choice may be that's really what you thinking ironically bill mars promoting the same kind of evil culture of murder and death that invited god's judgment in the flood in the first place it's also not very surprising that mars not said in the example involuntary to be the first to die incredibly as on carrying it as dark as easy and crow said that no would be portrayed they actually made guise look even more evil in fact no slatelike that god intended to eliminate every human being and not allowed any humour's repopulate the earth and not even attempt to murder his two baby grand daughters got ivinses the animals tell no pull off the dastard hollywood scream rather brigadiers of the last half of the script is a family killer thriller like sleeping with the enemy but in the end he speaks of molotails he says to himself to the crater i can't i can't do it i'm sorry i am so sorry he is just too compassionate to carry out god's cruel plan now is more loving than god and quite thus as evil and callous as no as portrayed ariaspes god as even worse was got uncurious during the days of noah absolutely no effect we are not only told that now i was a preacher righteousness to the lost but that god's spirit strove with the incorrigible and unrepented wicked for a hundred and twenty years before the flood gesuati six first three says quote than the lord said my spirit almost with man forever because he also is flesh nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years and quoteworthy tollings were the bible that this strivings man sin was owned to god's patient or the quote long suffering of god toward the wicked who were continually grieving his heart by the perverse and murders behavior first peter says quote when once the divine long suffering waiting the days of noah with a was being prepared in which a few that is eight souls were saved through water one of the most repeated trees throughout all scripture is the declaration that quote the lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness is eyoape thirty three first eleven says say to them as surely as i live a clerestory i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather they turn from their ways and live turn turn from your evil ways why you die people of israel and quotes according to the only reliable and ancient testimony we have of norsereddin the movie not should not shock us part of the agenda and many hollywood is to manufacture atheist and fatness and turned the mass against the one true god our creator in our eye poppy video hollywood war on god we document the notice themes of inverting god and satan in many of hollywood most popular movies the early churches greatest enemy with the notices who sat esterote the biblical narrative to portray god as satan and satan as god lover portraying both god and now in a dark life baranovsky imported nascent and it was other movies for instance in our article the nomothetae and the last days had a good fight doorside we expose nasica heathens in the ranks movies the fountain black swan and pie it is hard over estimate the colossal roll that hollywood has played in pledge in the world down a dark immoral spiral that is corrupting the world families and morals jesus christ warn that in the last days the world would once again be like it was in the days of noah just before the flood jesus prophesied matteaurian and given in marriage until the day when no entered the ark jesus worn in the same chapter quote because of the increase of wickedness the love of the most groesser six tells us that god fleeteth because it was filled with violence sexual perversion and the thought of human were only evil continually to day we are certainly seen the second coming of the days of noah transpire before our very eyes dear friend god doesn't want you to go to hell just as jesus warned that the last days would be like it was in the days of noah god is also provided an arch for the safety of you and your family in these last days now and the artwork glorious tip ological or prophetic picture for shadow and the coming of the lord jesus christ as the saviour of the world and art that god had before time or day to save us from the final judgment now a family was saved because of god's incredible mercy and grace just as there was only one door into the ark so jesus is a one and only door and archives the goddess provided to save us from the fire of god's wrath to come jesus christ himself said quoth i am the door if any one enters by me he will be saved i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me don't wait until it's too late just as countless people must have rushed to the art after the door was shut and sought to get in before the flood waters rose above their heads so many will wait until it's too late to repent of their sins and turned to christ tragically they will be overtaken by the torah of god because they waited too long jesus or that will be just like it was in the days of noah for those who wait too long to enter into the door of salvation jesus said it i quote but unless you repent you will all perish someone asked him lord are only a few people going to be saved he said to them make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you try to enter and will not be able to what the owner the house gets up a close the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading the'be weeping and

died for all your sins and he alone can save you from the wrath that we all deserve just as god used his creation of a beautiful rainbow as the symbol of his covenant not to flood the earth again to

heaven and new earth for those who have been saved to faith in jesus christ his word states though no longer be any pain or sorrow or tears for ever second peter chapter three says right after stated that people are willingly ignorant of the fact that god fled the earth and that next time will judge the world with fire and that is not won that any would perish but that all would come to repent it to be saved that quote since all these things are to be destroyed in this way what sort of people are you to be and all holy conduct in godliness looking for in hastening the coming day of god because of which the heavens who be destroyed by burning and the elements will melt with intense heat but according to his promise were looking for new heavens and a new berth in which righteousness twelve

that will never cast out and every one who calls upon the name of the lord will be saved do it now before too late don't dare gamble with your carlstadt great the stakes are too high and the turns far
