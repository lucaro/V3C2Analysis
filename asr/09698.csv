0.21,220.05, well it's exciting again to be here and to be kind of in this moment as matthew said i excited about what we're tackling to dam excited about what it is that we're getting into in its kind of foundation and so we wanted to begin kind of this semester where we all gather around together on begin to say what is it that this looks like it how is it that we can kind of focus on the same thing and really as we begin to think about this let me give you a review where we're going for their next series or next series is really based upon this idea that i believe that we are a very connected group of antithesis sounded very softest understand how we have deep abiding transparent authentic relationships how do we begin to move towards other people and how do we create the best friends that we've ever had in our lives siegelinda we begin to walk through this i think it will transform the community of our church so i'm excited about it about where we're going but when we begin to think about the ottertail basis how do you as a tar physical being connect with a spiritual being and really what does that look like and i think that sometimes we can count get and weird places by trying to figure out what is it actually look like for us to connect with god is a kind of living this inspiration counahan just let that drift during the week and i come back to sunday and i get inspired again what is it really mean and how is it that we begin to see god at work around us when i was in college i remember someone said you realize keegark around you and i didn't realize that i begin to have eyes to see what god was doing in a kind of transformed my life and to transform my spirituality and what it looked like for me to participate to hear from god and so sometimes i hear people say we must not a very spiritual person and well what i think is that peterwardein we're all wired to believe that there's something beyond ourselves that's kind of this natural bionda what that looks like a kind of faint know if you've ever been there trying to figure out realising around me and so how is it that we live a life that's connected to our heavenly father and see his hand and see his movement in our life and since this happening and i think this is incredibly important it's essential that we understand this because if not if we don't get this idea participation in church is really just lamentation race
220.41,261.99, yeah i don't understand why it's one of the things that seems really fun at first someone brings out hereditary were playing catch phrase ye it's really fun for like ten seconds and then you then you like what's the point of this game this game is like someone that the creator of this gamesome like that and i like egalitarianism that were playing in wreaths social thing for this is just an inspirational thing
262.56,278.4, and there are so many people who have come to church and they drop out because they didn't understand the key idea is that you would be able to have a connection and be able to have something beyond just your physical life that you're connected spiritually and so actually how does that work
278.76,284.13, and the great thing is you don't have to guess you don't have to try to crack the code you don't have to wonder
284.4,313.98, been given to you and scripture and so we're going to walk through scripture and jesus reveals how it is what it looks like for us to live as people that engaged with our heavenly father and so we're going to look at mark chapter one it's in the very beginning of the sin and mark chapter one gives us an answer to this question it begins to reveal to us how this can go beyond just playing games and how this can have some substance reality in your life and how you've began to connect beyond just events and things like that
314.4,320.85, and so you can see it on the screen you can turn their if you have your top of scripture but we'll dive into it
321.21,340.53, we'll start in verse nine says this well give you a little bit of background and they were going to dive into the text that were in it says at that time jesus came from nazareth in galilee and was baptized by john this is his cousin in the jordan just as jesus was coming up out of the water
340.59,399.48, so having been torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son whom i love with whom i am well pleased think about that moment so ease there is displaying the same thing that we do in our baptism at this his physical act of what is going on spiritually and all the sudden this is the evidence on open and and there's a spire the descends and gives the most insignificant encouragement ever like you know for us if this was something that someone said to you you are my son we want more please man you wouldn't forget that moment but if you athenians right go out in the woman and he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by satan and he was with the wild animals and the angels attended to him
399.84,407.49, never a verse fourteen as is this after john was put in prison jesus went into galloway proclaiming the good news of god
407.82,465.66, the time has come he said the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe the good news and so all this is leading to this this idea that the jesus begins his ministry with so i just wanted to give you i mean mark if you've ever had the gospel of mark it's like rapid fire it's like the action gospel right it is happening and this happened this even this happened and in this we begin to see in a rapid fire all the thistles moment for him to begin his ministry and this is the message that he has he is beginning to gather people and beginning to say i have something to say and what he has to say is one sentence right probably not but but it probably expounded on it when he would be but said this the time has come the king i have god has come near repent and believe the good news and for us when we began to say what is this all about how is this beyond just a game
466.86,472.98, jesus is saying this is what it's all about this is the core of what i've come
472.98,477.24, into this world to tell the people of this world humanity
477.6,495.09, so when we begin to look at this one of the things that we have to do is i begin to say what is he trying to communicate his he's saying this and as you begin to look at this and he kind of have the eyes one of the things that when i read this i came out this idea of the kingdom have god has come near this phrase
495.39,540.0, when he begins to say what's happening he starts off with this phrase the kingdom of god has come near and when we get to think about the kingdom of god coming near this might be something that might not seem strange but to those people in that time and that day and age when they offered that the kingdom of god is coming here that god is coming near what this would have been a just a mind glowing idea because if you asked any of them where is god the were discord live they would say they would point towards the direction of jerusalem and say there in the temple and the holy poles in the inner part of the temple that is where god dwells and that is far from the galley and so he is not near from us he is very far from us but this is exactly what god is and this is where he is that and so when jesus comes
540.27,548.91, and says hold it i've got to say something to you there's a time that's come and the first action that is being taken as got us going from distance to me
550.14,590.94, and for them to have a whole new view this because here's what they believed about god when they begin to understand who god is god was there it was away from them when they begin to when you look in the old testament if you would do something about where god was kind of contained the comedian obtained and if we would read and if there was something that happened wrong very few touched it you would die the holiness of god was so other there was something that was kind of a disconnected thing and so we bethshemesh that is occurring
591.09,593.22, the god is coming near
593.7,638.73, he's coming near physically through jesus christ this is the first aspect of this but the whole idea the good news is that god is not distant but he is near that people are being brought from being distant from god to being near to god and this is throughout all cultures the tension that exists in terms of spirituality that we believe that somehow there's a distance god but christianity begins to say here's what we're going for is it's a mere god is bringing you into a relationship and so jesus is telling them his mission he said i have come to bring people from being distant to god to bring near to god and this is the sin of humans that ultimately created the gap that ultimately in the very beginning when we look at this
638.79,659.67, there's sin that was entering the world the basically says god i don't want anything to you do with you i want to do it in my way and this gap created are the created this gap between god and between people but god decided to do this he decided to send his son jesus into the world and jesus his work is to close the gap between humanity and god
660.15,684.18, and by the he's not goin to make humanity good enough for god is going to actually stand in the gap and so from this what jesus does is he lives a perfect life and sacrificially for us gives up of his life dies on a roman cross so that there would be an experience of nearness given to us through his redemption of our sins
684.21,687.9, so we would be able to close the gap with their heavenly father
688.29,704.34, from the very beginning he said in his mission he said here's the thing this is the good news that the does have to be a fear of god in terms of i don't understand who he is or i'm living in shame but ultimately closing the gap and to day this is the same thing for us
704.49,727.38, when we begin to think are we living near to god or drawing or sorry at distant from god to me drawing near to god for so few here i've never made a decision to accept jesus christ and the sacrifice that he made it on that roman cross for you to cover over your sense and allow you to be redeemed and close that gap between you and god and so that distance is still very real
728.64,769.38, for some of you there's a distance because you have allowed that sacrifice to not be as important or not be foremost in your life not be a priority and so there's been a drift or for some of you maybe there's been an event that feels like there's a distance from god because you like you don't measure up in those overstatement into your space
770.28,782.79, then when we were to look closer at this too he begins this whole thing not just this idea of come to be a part of this the space of come to draw near but before that he says the time has come
783.27,836.55, the time has come and when we begin to think about time and space he's talking about space he sucked about what's going to happen but this idea of time for us in english there's that simple one word but in the new testament there are these two words that we get to use and these two words mean two different things and one of the things about in the new testament the word prostitute so we measure our days we have a watch and it tells us the cross or we have a chronograph right and so this is the crosthwaite able to just go through life and that outstretched this word promathin different it's a moment
837.42,839.31, it's even
839.37,847.68, it's an opportunity or something has changed because it's the right time it supersedes just
848.28,853.77, time and a sequential or successive kind of way but you're in a moment
854.64,864.78, when you begin to think about how you see your life the kind of two ways for you to see your life in terms of chronology or to see your words your life in terms of cairo moments
864.96,868.71, and what jesus she is as is the word cairo
868.71,878.61, and so he says he the time has come not not i came to this point of and really the dates all aligned and puttying the moment in time
879.03,880.2, has arrived
881.52,885.18, the moment that i have come to fulfill
885.72,887.7, has arrived
888.09,895.05, interesting thing at the very end of his life he uses the same cairo words he said the time has come
896.43,901.47, so we took in his entire ministry on earth talking about this moment
902.94,930.06, and this moment for us i think that we need to have this language that's integrated into our lives because i think that we can live in these carloman and here's what i mean by this in fact let me give you a slide talks about proof can talk about this in terms of inartistic in the next i says this threshing it just happened in our life
930.54,998.28, and what does it look like i see this is a thing that can be positive or negative you can have negative cairo moments you can have you can have positive things these are things like maybe you look back and for those of you who are married you know that marriage day and printed or maybe it was something that was a favorite at or things that you were a kiddie there's other things that are really negative you can think through madame in your family a tragic situation the moment you found out that the divorce was happening all of these things kind of untimeous and realisation recognize me things that happened in your past and really what happens is your emotions are one of the best indicators of this
998.76,1039.68, one of the best indicators that something is going on that is not just a linear thing that you're going to just buy past that when you begin to say what is going on here what is happening in this moment how is how is this kind of times chemisette this materialise eternal god breaks into your circumstances with an event that gather some of the loose ends of your life and not them together
1040.01,1041.33, his hands
1042.32,1084.35, and so when jesus is telling us about the time and telling about what we're looking at is using this word crossan oftentimes when we begin to think through this idea we will begin to think about how we interact with god were thinking about how do i get god's attention how is it that i pay enough to count to get god on my side i can of make my request known so i can get goates to this matter marland what we begin to see as jesus is revealing to us that the best question that we can and answer is not whether or not we've gotten godain because the cross answers the question of whether god's given his attention to us the question is do we have goddistead
1085.34,1087.71, i got to have our attention
1088.55,1094.82, and what he uses this is the beautiful thing is he uses all kinds of things to capture our attention
1095.87,1123.17, god uses all the cons of things through our life to capture us and to be able to look at how he's moving in our lives and so so must we need to begin to notice these things around our lives and i hope this becomes a fourteenth breaking through her trying to get our attention because that's the bigger question is a question that we should ask each other to god have your attention
1124.58,1126.62, that's what god desires
1126.95,1128.96, you don't have to fight for his
1129.53,1132.56, in your heart to say are you
1133.91,1136.76, you lining your heart do you have
1136.82,1139.94, attention that you're giving to your heavenly father
1141.95,1143.84, and so what happens with this
1144.2,1158.72, we begin to think through this when we begin to understand we have some options here when there begins a moment in your life and you've all had these men you how often had a lot of these moments when you begin to see that is something is happening you have an option
1159.8,1164.39, you've an option just to kind of go through and kind of do the crown of thing
1165.92,1169.13, you have an option to say here is something
1170.24,1171.89, that i need to
1171.92,1173.06, stop
1173.72,1177.98, think about to allow god to work in my life
1178.97,1200.39, ask ourselves time are we living by i would just marking off time or we looking for those events that god breaks through because this is how we stop playing the game this is how the stars become meriden begin to think about what does it look like for us to interact and engage with our heavenly father there's all kinds of stephenson around our lives and there's all kinds of things he's doing to capture our attention
1200.42,1208.46, he had that and what happens heissler number three it looks a little bit like this there were going along and there's this tyrman
1208.94,1272.03, then what we can do as we have the option to continue on through or we have the option to kind of begin to get into a loop and this is for us the way that were teaching people how to follow jesus into the tool we didn't come up with it but we're levering this tool to be able to help us to understand what it looks like for us to live this out and so what did jesus say the time has come the kanoon is near repents and believes we have slided number force as this is his repent and believe tessan this is how you go into this circle so instead of just coasting through this moment instead of just allowing the thing they just kind of bypast what you can do you can begin to engage with this and so what i want the owego deep with crisis now we begin to understand what it looks like for us not to be just just superficial followers of christ but we begin to say what does it look like for us to actually dig into what god asked for us and this takes courage for us to say i'm going to press this and the two question is this what is god saying and how do i respond
1272.03,1445.67, what is god saying and how do i respond and the two words we use it or the words that jesus used in this is the idea that we are to the process is spirituality looks like this that we are and it continual fashion almost like a slinky right or going through these carometa over and over and when we begin to think about what this looks like i think the word repent is really a word that is often misunderstood as negative begins repent and change your actions and stuff like that but when you begin to look at the bright what it means is this word met anointed man have been things that you you know you change your mind you you had a meteoric i remember the first week that takes one in platoon and then fifteen minutes later after i was you know still waiting on my order i wanted to sit meditating my mind on whether this is the rationalists so you know charmouth my kids the day and that siddhartha meant but they stopped asking me so great parent insana that's his idea for us is simply the internal change of mind and so often tomato about this is the external thing and belief is the internal thing but i really believe that we begin to understand what this looks like we have of those around and begin to understand that the first stars were saying jesus is better that i need to change in this and ultimately when we benetnasch and not a follower christ that you can have knowledge but there's a knowledge there's a gap between knowledge and obedience and i think that's unbelieving world looks into our world the church statuette to understand this is who i am i who god is there something's got to change god is eternal always there a completely holy it must be my issue and so how is it that i began to live this out different and this is how i begin to say what does this look like how do we understand this moment and so having experienced a caress event in our often we begin the process of learning it than we begin the process of this so
1445.76,1473.45, roses an event metanoia repentance and believed that these are process words and on one you didn't get the process and this for us is what this looks like in our next slide when we begin to say how is it that we began to walk through something that watches on the engages our heavenly father and allows us to understand what it looks like and so there's three parts of the repercussive parts of the belief process and so let me walk you through what this looks like
1473.84,1502.28, so observed thing is when we have a moment where something has happened it's it's really important for us to do this we can go up to the kind of the observed it to change our lives we need others to observe and observe where are this means taking note of our reactions emotions are thoughts we have to be honest in observations we have be honest and stings the way that they really are if we are actually going to change
1502.28,1512.15, and so at first starts with us saying okay here's this event what happened in that event what was going on in that event what was 
1512.15,1544.1, feeling what was experiencing what were my actions like and so we have to begin to say okay we've got to objectively look at this and begin to say if god is going to do something in our lives is there going to be a repentant believe in component to this it starts with this observation thing and then when we begin to move past the observation we begin to get into this moment of reflecting and this reflecting piecemeal a last observation why is the reflection
1544.49,1554.99, if the real changes to take place we must be honest with your answers we must then ask if there's a difference between my actions and god's character
1555.65,1565.67, so this is incredibly important so for us to begin to say he acted like this this was the thing that i did and now i need to figure out where the heat come from
1566.3,1581.06, and what does that out of when what is it that that's connected to and as i began to identify some of the emotions or some of the things that are going on on a deeper level we have to ask ourselves alone with god 
1581.21,1593.48, and those are the moments when we begin to see o this is so key for us if we were just introspection enough to be able to look at this and began to say oh you know what that doesn't look like god
1595.7,1607.76, and oftentimes what happens as we get into cycles of the same thing over and over in our life because we don't stop and ask is what i'm doing looking like who god is
1608.3,1643.31, stuck in this thing and we don't have a moment to be able to say you know what i need to understand that this is not who got is that there's a gap between my actions and the condition of my heart and the character of god and those are not in alignment and so when we begin to say what does that look like we began to identify whatsitsname you're doing this any way but the next thing is dust
1644.09,1658.94, for resonate turks this is a significant thing i says this discussing these thoughts with a group of trusted friends is important it can be hard to share your thoughts and struggles with someone else but it all you grow and all change the way god wants you to
1659.6,1660.47, so
1661.13,1664.85, here's the thing we go back and we base this 
1665.18,1677.12, on james five sixteen pray with one another in confessed another so that you may be healed this is so key for us when we keep it internal we don't change
1677.45,1685.94, i promise you if there's some stuff that you've been going through in your life that you've got a perpetually gone through the problem is likely
1686.81,1690.71, he never talked to somebody about this to the death that you need to
1691.31,1743.24, one of the key things i think if you'll just get someone who is a believer who is a foller of christ around you and you'd be in the dialogue that the significant thing penitent when we bring other people and say hey what do you think about this oftentimes a loving trusted friend will say incredible things to you that you would be able to never see on your own every single one of you and me as well we have blind spots and it's not until we have people around us that were discussing our life these carometa we began to be aware of the blind spot
1744.02,1745.43, don't live
1745.79,1754.97, blinds but disgust and discover with other people that's the repentance process and then we moved to the belief process
1755.18,1772.25, i begin to see this response and he says this for the plan after reflecting a discussing the next step is to plan this always involves considering the kingdom of god first pray discussing consider the best course of action to glorify god there's all kinds of things
1772.31,1802.61, that we think through but we don't have a plan and if we don't have a plan if we don't have something that we begin to say you know god was speaking to in my life and this way but there's something that i need to be able to respond to and i need to be able to engage into this and so there's something that i actually need to do about this that there's some action that i need to take towards this and i need to figure out how is it that i begin to change my actions in my thoughts from this to that and that is incredibly incredible
1803.75,1824.06, the next part of this in the action step is to take and have an account or bring somebody who's in an accountability towards this because there's all if you're like me there's all kinds of things that i think in my head oh this is the goal that i have you know and i just have this in my head and i ultimately you know
1824.09,1849.86, don't reach it and it's just kind of okay because i never really told anybody about this right so i didn't tell you that i had to go so it's really easy for me to duck out of it it's really easy for me to not be the person i want to be because you know i didn't really have another my life it is crucial for us to be able to bring other people in and say he i want to live this way i want to be this kind of person
1850.31,1853.61, which you help me with that would you ask me questions
1855.2,1862.85, i've been around hundreds and hundreds of people and talk through spirituality and establish it and people that are trying to do really good things
1863.78,1866.03, left on our own
1866.87,1872.78, an incredible incredibly few amount of us that would actually
1873.26,1874.37, do it
1874.67,1877.34, things that we have difficulty with on our own
1877.49,1882.29, we need each other you need other people around you simply to ask the question
1882.5,1885.86, you need to say hey i want to give you permission
1886.16,1887.72, this question
1888.41,1890.87, accountability in the final thing is to act
1891.44,1901.28, to begin to put this into place so that your actions now because of this caro moment you enter the car circle and you began to have actions that are different
1901.31,1922.34, and so the people can look back at your life and you can look back to your life and say you know what the gap between who i was and who the character of god is its beginning to narrow and i'm beginning to be live more like christ and this is the follower of jesus if you're not doing that if if there is not some sort of a something that you're getting closer to jesus you're not following
1922.88,1929.27, an you're just saying you know this is a great thing i don't want to do anything but i just want to be a fan
1929.75,1933.53, we have too many fans and not enough followers in the kingdom of god
1934.22,1939.53, this is jesus is statement he got to repent and to believe
1940.16,1943.61, and oftentimes when we begin to think about this
1944.9,1949.85, we have to understand how do we balance all of these things together what does it look like
1951.35,2039.73, morning i got up and heard about the bay area earthquake you know that happen and there's few people to injure and stuff like that but begin to think about this for some of those people there was a choice there's something that happened that sotavento of the north is in the love he bare that should expect it but it might still be out of the north to have an earthquake and her people post and say i like my house was on roller skates or these kind of things like the shaking out of contortionistic and so maybe you know there there and think about this southerners and they don't shake and this is not something that is not but you begin to see toussenel in fear that begins to come over you bethought you bed but there's nothing you can do to stop it and it is just going on without you you realize in the mist of this that you're not going to die it's not like your house is going to collapse but you do know that there's nothing that you can do to stop your home from shaking and it begins to be a method
2041.08,2075.22, so you can go back and you can begin to say okay there is this moment is there something in this moment that i can just pass this by a kind of opera other crowns or i can say you know what's in this moment there was something that happened i felt something could i instead of by passing the crowning the charwomen began to enter into the car circle and begin to ask monserrato begin to look at that and say you know what i had this moment of fear and really when i unpacked it a little bit it was a fierce survival i mean everybody would have a fear of dying in that citizenry but this was really a fear that i was out of control
2076.99,2079.78, holding on trying to make it stop
2081.31,2082.51, i didn't
2082.87,2084.4, i couldn't handle it
2084.61,2097.66, then you go into the reflective kind of thing and you begin to say okay so if i was trying to make that stop if i was trying to figure out is that what does that say what's going on where did that fear come from what was happening there
2097.72,2104.59, maybe you can identify this and begin to say you know that in this i recognize that it wasn't a survival for it was a control fear
2105.22,2113.53, i began to recognize in that moment that i had some control issues and i wanted to make it stop and i try to make it stop it it wouldn't
2113.74,2115.15, wouldn't stop
2115.75,2132.01, we begin to talk with people around us and say you know what i had this you know in the hurricane sorry when the earthquake happened began to have this really fearful response and it seemed like it was a little bit more about control i you see that in my life and they might say
2132.04,2136.99, there's a few things that seems like you're really putting a lot of effort into controlling in your life
2137.83,2141.19, you begin to identify and say when i reflected on that
2141.76,2148.66, i really can't of want to control my own life and i'm really distrustful that god has my best in store
2149.11,2156.25, there's a fear in there and that doesn't seem to my belief in the character of god is not truly the character of god
2156.4,2160.87, so you begin to say what can i begin to do what my plan
2161.5,2168.67, you might be able to say i can re going to start identifying moments when this out of control feeling surfaces
2170.11,2176.89, when this at oconto feeling surfaces what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back to some scripture that element is
2177.25,2202.3, and i'm going to actually put a rubber band on my arm and my wrists and just helping me to understand what flexibility looks like and the fact that i can't i can't structure everything and make sure that nothing is going to happen and so i have to be flexible in my life than my theologians
2202.99,2205.24, to ask me on doing with that
2207.31,2214.45, there's my responding to those issues in a godly way or in a lack of god at godliness
2215.71,2225.1, the final thing is i'm actually going to do it i'm not just going to talk about it but i'm going to identify those things and replace those with the truth
2226.15,2271.48, might be something like that it might not be something that is significant is that in terms of a moment it might be a little bit of something that happens normative in your life and you begin to kind of process this i don't want to just say these are big moments but let's say you have let's say you have a conversation with your wife about coming home to be content where you begin to recognize the something happening and the conversation was it really exactly a pleasant experience and one to try to figure out what is this look at what's this dynamic look like in our relationship and saw
2272.08,2280.12, that said person has an opportunity to continue in the crone of or to enter into the cars
2280.78,2282.43, what does that look like
2283.0,2306.76, and you begin to think about this you know as you begin to think about what are my actions and what does this look like and i begin to realize that the actions that i'm communicating and i come home late saddled the pronounce there but something dainty
2307.12,2338.38, i begin to realize this and i begin to understand what this looks like and begin to say okay there's some actions that really communicate that there's something else that's a higher priority and so what are those actions is that begin to reflection what do they look like and somehow my actions are talking about my valuing of my family and that doesn't
2338.83,2341.05, who god is and there's a gap in that
2341.89,2345.1, i'm pressing a little deeper into this
2345.19,2347.53, candidly say that there's
2348.31,2350.38, a little darker side to this
2351.55,2364.51, maybe this coming home late is a reflection of this idea of the trust i have of god and that if i don't keep at it he is not going to keep at it and i'm not sure if i can trust god
2364.84,2366.13, this thing 
2366.34,2368.62, building given my life to
2369.4,2378.43, i began to bring other people i begin to say hey there's thing that i'm perceiving in my life that i'm not sure if i can trust god
2379.57,2384.85, i'm not sure if i believe this and this is brought on by the conversation right
2385.96,2392.74, begin to recognize that i need to be able to have a system in place to communicate the values to my family
2392.8,2398.92, to communicate somehow how i am going to react towards them
2399.4,2432.1, and so i have a plan and that its great always have a six o'clock meeting so that never a working too late as i began to think about my kids going back to school and i think about the time that i need with him to create a plantation tottered
2435.13,2454.72, be able to see as i act this out this week my wife did a thing whereas he was talking through what like the most wealthy
2455.08,2456.01, right
2456.55,2464.5, and it can but i'll take it you know i'll i'll take it to any man to be up there with that hat said a pretty good deal
2465.25,2475.6, but i have to begin to relate at that conversation i could just say you know what she didn't understand you know what there's a lot of pressure and there you know what i can just do a little bit better
2478.39,2480.04, could push us
2480.19,2488.08, to moments to be able to not just say i'm going to live by this but i'm going to try to figure out how is it that i understand
2488.29,2491.95, the god is that i understand what he is doing
2492.28,2494.59, i understand that he is at work
2496.12,2497.8, so for you to night
2498.76,2501.04, what time are you living in
2501.91,2511.96, are you living in corona where you're just seeing things go by are you living in cairo when you begin to see that there are these moments and there is the things that are happening
2512.47,2513.91, does that look like
2514.9,2516.79, time are you living in
2517.48,2522.88, i want us to be people that are recognizing god around a so that we don't be that are playing games
2523.3,2526.99, to be the people that are engaging the circle
2526.99,2531.19, be able to go around and say this is how i actually become a follower of christ
2532.27,2534.1, a moment
2534.52,2536.5, i've recently gone through
2536.92,2540.19, there's something that's happened that has triggered
2541.09,2544.3, here's the thing it's not about getting gaditanian
2544.39,2546.76, but god getting your attention
2546.85,2551.29, he uses all kinds of things in our lives to bring us into these moments
2551.29,2554.02, clearly articulate what this looks like
2555.7,2557.44, this is who were called the 
2557.89,2564.22, this bill around ation for us to be people who are not just going through the motions that are truly experiencing god
2565.27,2566.59, we pray for
2567.82,2569.95, that you would
2569.98,2571.75, in these moments that you would
2573.85,2576.28, reveal who you want us to be got
2576.46,2603.37, but she would allow us to hear this and to be moved towards his god that they would be people who hear this idea of repentance and belief and are drawn to it and then to day that we would just hear this but we would begin to talk through our lives and talk through the lens of having tyrants and talk to the lands of being able to understand what it means for us to to change our mind and to act more godly and to to move towards god
2603.82,2605.59, let us lord
2606.31,2607.54, respond
2607.93,2609.04, evening
2609.82,2615.55, understand how you've begun to even in this time create a caroom in our arts
2615.94,2618.82, respond to that and your only the man
