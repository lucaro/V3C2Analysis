222.18,225.81, seated towards the thing is more so for myself
225.96,227.67, there are some things
228.6,235.5, i mean you can say that you want but sometimes it's not socially accepted so you have to make give those feelings out as
235.89,238.32, and just like a comedian

276.51,277.98, parts of it
278.28,282.87, people who exist within certain spaces
283.11,286.68, those people may have the power to do something but
287.7,289.74, but inspiring others
290.91,294.81, anything really i don't really think

471.03,472.2, that
474.48,478.86, as it will take a describe energy and like lightnin
479.1,480.93, another
481.59,482.64, some 
483.42,485.64, even though out
488.91,493.35, the premier thing there is sometimes were outlined
