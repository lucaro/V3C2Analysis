0.0,8.4, i am quite a backwater or about the web this time will be talking about cases
8.4,11.64, this is what we really building
12.39,14.7, the simple
14.97,30.03, just get your store am i assuming that you give some basic basic knowledge about a shameless we'll be carlovingian sweet in another store
30.24,33.21, and before i get started my phone is
33.24,45.24, it is made the sheet it's very useful why hinderend infuriated mate get this hopper you want regret so
47.01,48.42, this is the
48.63,60.69, ah it's not hard to call it website desiderat that were going to be doing its very various simple stuff it
61.14,67.23, real began someone who hasn't duchesses before so
69.06,72.15, but it stopped with a what sees
72.48,76.02, so let me close
76.08,77.79, those
78.09,79.8, well
80.88,82.23, and soon
84.03,87.96, blank pages aldermen so
88.47,90.66, when you're writing a
90.66,98.49, or when you writing a chimnapoos to be ah how should i said
99.15,102.18, so boatlike
102.51,105.6, document not like website
105.75,117.21, the purposes of circassia document and make it look like a website so ceases is only for style your website
117.48,118.44, and
118.53,124.89, for stimulus only ceases and not a hamlike tables
125.46,130.83, it's a very old practice and yet
131.1,134.07, that's basically it so
134.19,138.3, how to use cresswell first
138.96,143.04, you need to make a new year says for
143.58,154.53, the notes now amusing extension be previous similarly in other literatures just make a fire and
154.65,156.54, save it with
158.4,161.01, contention
161.19,163.95, i already did that
164.22,166.23, some fine
166.44,170.04, and now we need to link it to our
170.07,171.81, well
172.35,179.88, the way we do this we first have opened to hear to website the first one i saw
180.12,181.53, oh
181.68,194.07, the schools to slashed tacks in a reference for a egean i there one element that
194.76,198.9, to discussing great now its due link
200.67,204.06, sorry
205.68,210.18, we can use the link tack to point
210.18,214.26, i monument or so
214.44,216.33, so there a couple
216.84,234.3, that unique in it put in that dick the first the first one is real and it defines what the relationship between the exterminators will in this case the rail should be touched
235.38,244.2, and by ways means cascading touches will learn why their gold cascading in
244.2,245.82, what's
245.82,255.75, the mixed nature statesmanship enough that's the fact to be caspian
256.44,258.69, next one type
258.72,261.36, says this 
261.63,271.23, the file that imparting to his seeince as well and medicean
271.35,282.63, you can read more about media the media attribute her right bastion what device in documents will be displayed
284.28,288.87, now castrato another
289.23,292.08, great website that i use all the time
292.38,304.74, that was cool of come lasses that for our reverencing all the seaports a what not
304.92,306.54, so
306.9,313.32, we have planted our seashore
313.47,324.84, no one needed some mauseant by way i'm just using a examine point all
326.4,328.17, nothing
328.35,341.7, complicated and once again i assuming that you have some basic knowledge about isaac because history is going to be about cases only
342.39,350.46, so let's get started with the market will make a
350.61,353.76, first we
355.32,360.51, you see why we need refer in a moment
363.33,364.56, so
365.25,378.45, you know about taxation soon and when you are using the session to be using on this tack a lot it
378.45,383.58, i believe it comes from a division
384.09,408.45, i saw it just on to a separate you know a piety so that my personal opinion that's how i understand it is used to separate one particolarmente from the rest of the rocket so when i say i with a ideality of the player with ideas
409.05,414.15, basically i'm saying everything you sisily
414.3,428.13, inside my patrol something like sir i hope you understand you i hope you'll get the concept as as we are working on i believe the best the best way to explain it is with practice so
429.03,437.13, first we need the betrothment let's see the other
437.61,440.1, finished document
441.03,442.44, we have
446.43,454.86, one for the you know this could be a block geodetical care there is a side bar
455.76,457.35, and there's the footer
458.31,463.53, simple and that's where we're going to be making so
464.73,473.73, let's make the color again if that with a ither
473.91,476.43, close
476.76,479.16, then
479.55,484.92, then we content
484.95,498.09, then when ye to make ye side bar and finally the poor
500.31,502.89, second
507.06,511.14, okay so
511.26,517.53, elisabetta about what this attribute
520.38,533.25, the idea and the class accident near used to reference or halter mark
533.43,535.95, in the cases for
536.37,537.72, so
538.74,547.71, okay we have found the same title or let's say
547.83,550.56, dane
550.77,551.76, so
552.54,554.94, we reference this
555.3,579.3, the other division difficulties reference that can be athapascan state while we we will use the idea attribute which we we choose a consenting in i can say heteroclite just keep it simple for no
579.99,584.58, and we can say like this and 
585.39,589.08, the girl read
589.65,599.67, and we won't see anything right now because we need to know actually worse let seven and
599.67,603.0, winona in books
603.84,604.95, yes
605.46,607.11, we have our
607.11,612.51, the division which being one inside it so
612.78,620.67, first one first let's reversely proper
620.97,622.44, and say
622.47,628.17, a man six pins white
628.8,632.88, we sent it for definite margin
634.56,636.72, zero at
636.99,638.76, talk about
639.0,647.94, while those on bilateral take my word for it so
648.15,652.38, here we are reverencing the halter
654.36,656.82, so the
657.51,670.71, this with a mastering these i lost my dog to my point was that it
670.92,672.72, supposed to be 
672.9,674.31, unique
674.31,682.53, the idea should be unique for each for every other duck for example it would be
682.53,689.73, we'll be working but it won't be right if i may another if with an idea of father
689.82,696.0, for that we need to use glass
697.26,699.69, the same way as
700.23,702.24, i 
702.39,704.19, but
704.31,714.69, it proposes three years it for when you came for many many distant the same properties for example a
715.89,717.81, when it
718.41,723.27, say that this is adamant
723.54,730.59, cassander competitor artist
734.61,736.83, because all those for
736.83,738.69, elements will have
738.96,740.58, come on properties
741.06,742.29, so
742.86,746.34, continue with the ana
747.54,750.57, no first
750.96,758.67, another important consideration to mention we can reference
758.94,760.59, the
762.0,765.06, just like this
765.24,767.94, white pine deck
768.3,779.16, and we're going to a reference both you know to change its background oh it's just your something about
779.25,780.54, it
780.99,782.13, like
782.64,784.62, we
784.77,785.94, she
786.39,792.33, it was that or oh maybe maybe not
796.74,803.82, he raises a kahana
804.27,806.34, julie
806.52,809.07, but mincopies
810.93,813.69, i
813.9,815.31, i like to
818.64,821.04, that's so
821.58,822.93, i
823.41,830.01, we can reference any group of tacks just by tipping the technique
831.75,836.13, and we now we're going to use
837.12,840.0, class in order to
840.03,846.39, define some common properties about for all those for
849.48,854.67, so let's say
855.3,858.09, what wilt
859.56,862.29, one element
862.29,867.21, no conception using it here
867.27,880.08, the beginning of an that's because we're reverencing class and for all osireion say by white and well
880.08,881.31, let
882.45,887.82, i forebore is onosander so
890.7,892.83, let this
892.83,895.35, we say infest
895.5,898.26, see that
898.47,900.72, the heathen
901.05,907.8, the division is fastened that's because we
908.1,922.44, reference the class all elements of all taxes with the castle body elements in we gave them white vagrant and which cascarilleros or body elements of our four tacks
923.85,939.84, so let's continue for the cure lessay we wanted to be ninety six hundred unthinking sixty six white took on exes
942.87,946.8, and it should be it
950.88,955.23, i don't know why this hasn't sent her
955.5,964.65, because we killooleet no
967.56,969.81, why didn't i send her
972.12,973.56, oh yeah
981.96,984.36, as it
1018.68,1022.13, oh yeah time
1023.45,1024.8, so
1026.9,1029.72, i want don't need
1031.16,1033.17, i well
1034.46,1050.36, on we we knew our reporter and he was trying to reference weeper so we corrected and say peace reckendorf we say and we loved it so be centered like so
1052.28,1062.15, i guess now is the time to talk a little bit about the syntax of cases and in those like this
1062.96,1064.88, um
1065.12,1072.47, general smith general contexts like the selector
1072.5,1084.71, is this where you say which elements which are attacked you on to effect like for example peter or porcelain the
1085.34,1086.99, ah
1087.71,1091.82, those princes 
1092.54,1094.16, in those
1094.31,1097.4, unique to ah
1097.49,1099.68, the attributes
1099.68,1105.14, athos goingness attribute
1105.14,1106.55, so i can
1107.0,1108.5, but you
1113.54,1120.47, and it doesn't matter if you tell on the same 
1121.19,1124.64, so that's perfectly
1124.7,1129.29, you can also another common
1129.32,1137.3, oh i should say loike this embrasure near
1138.71,1144.47, it's it's more readable but it makes your senses
1144.83,1149.15, think and ultimately can be carefree
1149.63,1158.6, i prefer the terrain on one or butsuma so let's continue with our pace
1159.02,1161.42, let some
1161.48,1166.67, did the centesimo to
1167.15,1168.23, the
1168.53,1173.99, content is not content
1176.36,1177.5, no
1178.46,1182.51, we'll make it up
1184.43,1194.45, makemake itself with five hundred six tall
1195.8,1198.38, see what we have
1198.41,1204.08, and there colette froment's not quite
1204.35,1205.85, what i showed you
1208.07,1215.57, no space between those torments what we can do is say
1215.57,1224.66, for together with a margin on the bottom and make it twenties
1227.6,1232.97, no i shouldn't be margin between dose to anne
1234.14,1241.67, so let's move on he's see side bar
1242.63,1246.44, is 
1247.52,1252.11, i say to him i forego
1252.26,1263.09, and five hundred bighas talk like the contents terrain the same red
1263.33,1283.1, so that careful seemed from dearest no space between those two elements and will see from the contents will say margin right enticing idea is to keep the same
1283.16,1292.16, the same margin everywhere on our page just for a consistency in giberne professional tapage
1292.7,1298.67, let wakeful
1300.92,1310.34, and let's make it a hundred sixty pious wife and
1311.03,1319.34, a mixture wishout no
1320.99,1328.55, and wienerwurst and to twenty six or
1329.93,1337.64, we cannot or basic very very basic page out from her
1340.34,1352.49, let us so that's rottendale bit what we can say is oh i haven't talked about 
1352.94,1355.58, something very important that the
1355.7,1360.98, of electors for example defy
1361.19,1363.41, say the one
1366.2,1374.27, i'm not sure this example were worth but let's try if we say each one margin
1375.77,1377.69, artifices
1377.69,1380.24, when i say margin
1380.36,1391.97, i mean margin of all sides top bottom left right there also other ways you can see with your own you can now find marches
1391.97,1405.65, for example if we suited to numbers like wait here he just pretended although his number that mean sir over talking poem and tutor the left and right
1408.5,1409.85, say
1411.41,1421.19, anticipation for example that miss marshall
1421.64,1429.62, it whateffer them just by looking arcana
1430.79,1435.47, just for rice thereto
1435.53,1443.24, i left so let leloo fresh
1443.3,1449.33, i can see it that titles moved away from the edge of the tea
1449.48,1451.46, this
1453.23,1456.71, and now what we can also say
1460.01,1462.89, its opinion
1466.25,1477.86, content fresh we can see that boat he once gave for margin of porticos but what we can say now is
1479.72,1482.99, give them marciette
1485.54,1493.37, with a rage not only which is
1493.52,1496.97, inside the definite of father
1497.18,1500.42, so you can stick
1500.45,1503.9, electors in the means
1503.9,1512.84, he looked for an age one which is sensitive or any other tack with nigger
1513.14,1521.54, if we save now and fresh we can see that the one which ended content
1521.66,1524.9, oh not an element
1525.32,1531.8, it marches because we are reverencing only to the ones which are in sight are
1532.94,1537.08, what we can also say is 
1537.56,1538.85, one
1539.3,1548.99, give it a nitiation
1550.25,1554.57, and this
1554.75,1557.03, so
1557.78,1562.97, oh once affected by a certain
1564.02,1572.09, certainty and now if we say agone with idiotic
1573.29,1578.0, make it a
1579.44,1582.38, so what would you did he said
1582.38,1584.39, work for a nation
1584.87,1587.0, an idea of title
1590.96,1599.3, so this the order in which you can supply selectors known of actors but
1600.02,1604.07, there go go like this that
1610.58,1614.27, action and not really sure about this
1616.91,1627.59, as to correct me in the common section of the fine wrong but right now it just doesn't want of into my head what will there was something like
1627.77,1629.54, as
1629.87,1632.18, ash dang
1632.84,1635.21, no no jack i
1635.42,1639.02, i'm pretty sure that was the correct order
1639.53,1645.95, malcolmson if if that's not quite the case
1646.58,1650.9, and see i even talked about something
1651.38,1654.74, important we talked about
1655.22,1657.98, yes for we talked about
1658.67,1665.27, you see how to link noises fell each in will
1665.39,1667.16, discuss the
1667.97,1670.91, electors that you can use
1673.34,1674.57, and
1675.86,1679.79, that's about it so look for
1680.39,1682.64, the story of which we
1682.76,1689.72, only he again basic basic stuff and diane
1690.53,1693.68, yes where were donated
1693.71,1701.0, my name's nicias look for my element stories i mean the very near future
