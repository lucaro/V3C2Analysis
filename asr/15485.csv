389.94,394.47, god lets us snow who we are as individuals
394.8,399.51, and how we can be reconciled to him
399.57,415.41, all of us had made up in life through what we say may be what you do or what you think the bible calls this sin and sin is what renders us helpless

489.51,494.76, god offers that love and we can either accept it
494.91,500.19, rejected by accepting it you make a commitment to help
501.06,540.42, marriage is the same a gobelot that bind a man and woman together in a marital relationship and they are committed to one another and to god this type of love and if you you know the you hear this but this is a god they love it is patient it is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it's not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs

1328.73,1353.21, before i get started because going to get time wouldn't amazing night i just want to take a minute for we say anything else to say you know it takes a lot of work and effort and time to put on a awesome party like this so can you just give it up for everyone who helped out with flowers and decoration is something
1353.87,1358.97, but most important people there is the party doesn't happen unless it has a host
1358.97,1369.56, so the two most important people i'd like to think our missus robin for puttin on such an awesome party joining me
1371.33,1384.41, all right ryan else turn me i feel like it and to marry you again so my name is david or zambo tonight there's a lot of a fraternity man here so we all have multiple names
1384.74,1394.61, and i met sparks ten years ago at alabama in upsala and you know over the years
1394.61,1428.48, i been blessed to have many many great friends it's one of the things i treasure most in life but sparks has been one of the absolute best of all those and you've been more than a friend to me you've been a brother so it's my honor to tilt make this toast for you and what i want to do calista to you a little bit about sparks sparks is for journey the way i am i never call renouard for a number of years now and got to know him but i've known for a long time and i know what an amazing man this is one tell you a little bit about
1428.54,1461.24, kind of man your marrying and the kind of things that he's going to bring to a marriage and i think there's three things the first thing is sparkle guy who loves adventure we've been on a ton of adventure together and many things down a short list of the others we played friezes and dozens of times and see campus at once we started at midnight and in mental down we've gone having together and bolder to search for endangered bad species
1461.24,1480.2, i found we were to camp in trip once an aspen and looked all we can couldn't find campistron it of camping in the south back yard and ordered a pizza for dinner we once skedule black diamond run an aspinalled possible
1480.2,1486.53, but it turned out to not be possible for me after us keep the bottom i proceeded the yard sale my way down
1486.53,1501.65, entire thing we be legally trespass and explored the underground tunnel network beneath counting that we would not a trip to a shooting range one time which ended up with you taking a trip to the emergency room
1501.98,1506.06, the shot but inoculate
1506.39,1513.23, we've engaged in multiple bets with other people with the stakes being that the loser has to be their pants on the spot
1513.56,1518.81, again can ask me letter to story neither of us have ever lost that bet
1519.02,1533.87, with kind many fourteen or together some i like to do and one time on pike's peak my final fourteen or spargo out to tuskless so he got picked up on the road by a pair of senior citizens and driven a final thousand feet to the top
1534.14,1548.06, we take multiple twenty four hour road trips out to california where we packed fourteen college guys into a fifteen passenger van driven twenty four hours played flag football on the beach for two days turned right around and come home
1548.09,1549.71, a rough trips
1549.77,1569.21, we've had bring your own t video game nights and then probably the one adventure we haven't had but i've always wanted to do with you is you've never taken me up on my offer to i've always just wanted to see what happened if you eat just like one not to one but how bad can it be you married him ical professional
1569.39,1571.49, now
1571.94,1582.56, a lot of great adventures together so that's something you can really look forward to celeste second thing that's always marked sparks as a man is his character
1582.95,1591.26, when we were in college we both had a mentor who really instilled in us the value of
1591.38,1631.61, kind of things you were doing in college or what you're going to do after in college but the character of yourself and that means things like your integrity and who you are on the inside who you are when no one's watching what really matters to you and sparks you as much as any one i've ever known are a man of character and your man who pursues that i can think of countless ways you've always been the first got to helpless move we moved dozens of times i've seen you be extremely generous with your time and money to all kinds of different things throughout our friendship you've always been the first guy can call it too an when something's happening or something is not going right in life and vice versa
1631.64,1639.98, one of the things that i love about you and your character is it's not just who you are now but you have a desire to care about who you are becoming
1640.19,1645.62, and you've always cared about the man that you're turning into and that's absolutely one of your best traits
1645.83,1702.77, but the third and polly most important thing about those men that i respect is that all those things are anchored in jesus as much time as sparks and i have spent being completed together out in adventures my favorite memories with you have been for a series of years we went to the same church together and every saturday night it was myself sparks on my wife katy we would just stay after the service and we would just think and we would process and we would talk about what we learn and what we learned about god what we learned about jesus and that says everything about you when i first met you you are a very different person in than you are now like chuckleheaded you have a history you have a past we all do but as i look back on the ten years i have known you i am amazed at the way that you've matured in the ways that you allowed to jesus to change you into grow you and to turn you into the man that you are to day so kelsey
1702.83,1709.88, makes me so excited about you guys being together is i think you bring out all the best of those things in sparks
1709.91,1716.78, been amazing to see and i hope that all those things mark your marriage just as they've marked our friendship
1716.84,1720.02, so if you raise your glasses with me
1720.62,1729.98, i make the terran in case to marriage mark by joyful adventures a genuine pursuit of character and relentless love for jesus
1730.31,1738.68, and now cases made of honor and ryan sister rachel will give her toast
1745.49,1747.38, everyone i
1747.95,1760.22, i also thank you all for coming out to day to celebrate beautiful halcyon ryan and i do want to give us special thank you to the room and for putting on as such a great party
1760.28,1767.51, the use for those of you who don't know me i'm ranlett sister rachel
1767.57,1777.08, and as little sisters sent to do we tend to learn a lot from her big brothers and i disinter some of those lessons with you today
1777.14,1789.11, ryan taught me how to do a back flip on the trampling he taught me how to get my feet under me my very first time figure skating at last and i started
1789.47,1802.64, and he also taught me not to laugh and i like to see a quick story with you guys to day about a time ryan and i have done some laughing over
1802.64,1825.53, so a few years back ryan invited me to go to the aid holiday gift exchange and when i arrived to the fraternity house i noticed my present was the act same size and shape as his and we exchanged a little luck and a mass kind of
1825.74,1828.98, to the side and don't really think much about it
1829.13,1836.42, and loiter actually edges younger brother peter here with us to day

1848.66,1856.88, ryan's present which was also a camouflage snuggin
1856.94,1866.36, and so i never thought i would be rid would me any one just as gupis the two of us

1929.15,1938.57, he is the most selfless person i've ever met she gives way more than she takes and

1945.68,1986.48, she loves those around her so much but somehow still has dedicated her life and her career to healing and helping strangers and i just can't wait to learn my first lesson from my big sister and so i did want to raise my glass and say cheers to many more lessons and to the lovely newly weds i love you both so much and now the mother of the bride debbie would like to share her words with you all as well
1987.59,2016.87, everyone i'm debbie roman and i'm really speaking on behalf of bob and myself and we just couldn't let this evening pass without expressing to you our extreme gratitude for being here with us and sharing this most amazing day with celia ryan and for many of you you traveled such incredible distance i know some of your pretty local but many of you came from missouri and from florida and from california and
