1.05,32.46, we may be in a situation right now where your anxious about your finances but i want to give you some good thing it really is possible turn any financial situation round and we're going to give you tips to day on a how you can do that on injoyin every day life 
36.75,49.32, to the program to day howard date in the founder of conical ministries joins us again to day with practical steps on how you can control your finances and stop allowing them to control you
49.41,78.42, he first of all welcome the state with an i just kinda got stuck on that word control because i thought you know really money does control a lot of people to absolutely no question about a bit in the world was it to be free of that joy because we can only be experiencing that the fullness of our relationship with christ winston control using that should control us his hand through the holy spirit exaltados even force us so it's not even really like a
78.51,83.25, control like we might think of control he wants us to be led and guided by the holy spirit
83.25,86.49, if you're controlled by other outside forces
87.06,89.82, very difficult to follow that leadership
90.18,94.98, for example if someone is over their head and debt
95.25,96.9, it's difficult
97.05,98.91, follow the large leading
98.94,101.25, he wants you to give something
101.58,134.4, be beyond what you would normally do exactly right i love what proper twenty seven tells us of the barber is servant to the lender an eye said you know the lord don't want us to be servant to the creditor ernesto be servant to him and to those people that he puts in our path and so when you are in death significantly and dead in particular it does you know restrict your freedom to really follow and serve christ the way he wants us to you know how hard i think we've had so much dead in our society ness just such a part of our life style to day that
134.58,142.29, i would imagine that most people even watching right now it probably has never even entered their minds that they could ever live at free 
142.38,183.6, i look at my children and it's been an encouragement i mean my daughter twenty seven of course she grew up in a house where the debt was not encouraged and she and her husband already have their house paid for and what would really excited us the month after they paid their house off and they they ate apaneuthen jelly sandwiches for five years to do right but they had a friend of theirs she was having a difficult pregnancy was going to cost him a thousand dollars more at the hospital and because they didn't have that payment for the house they had that thousand dollars they could give to their friend and that really is what i think so i'm god's heart that we would be free up
183.69,186.48, follow what he wants us to do
186.75,195.84, the impatience factor is so big today because one of the reasons why there's so much dead is because people don't want to wait and save
196.29,200.07, the things that they want that's right and my husband
201.24,206.07, maybe we can say he has a gift in the area of finances i don't know exactly where it came from but
206.34,208.44, he was even a young boy
208.8,210.69, he would save money
210.81,212.31, his socks
212.61,215.76, i put his money in his socks and hid them
215.79,220.86, and his dresser drawer and he came from a family of several children he would always have
221.28,222.78, money and
222.84,224.16, many of them
224.22,229.02, we want to borrow from him all the time and though he saved and saved and paid cash for
229.35,232.14, first car which was a very nice car
232.14,238.44, dave has always had that principle in him first of all he's very patient manner so i'm sure that when you have patience
238.56,241.14, your character that helps you in this area
242.13,243.6, because of that
244.86,248.58, we have saved and paid cash for everything
249.09,251.73, in the ministry and 
251.76,259.2, never paid any interest in all the years that we've been doing this and i'm not saying that it's wrong if somebody has to do that or feels led to do that
259.38,261.66, i'm just saying it's such a
261.9,266.22, it takes such a bird that right off of you
267.24,271.71, sometimes you have to wait on things you know we took a five years to build
272.19,275.55, building that we're sitting in here now versus just going out and
275.7,285.48, you know getting it right now and then making payments on it for maybe twenty years but we saved the money for those things and really wants you get in the habit of doing that
285.99,288.03, becomes your wife style
288.18,309.96, the way that you live no different than you know just charging the nuchae hard for convenience and i pay him off and i'm not i'm not trying to put a boy on a gilt trip because i know that when people listened to stuff like this is like well you tell me from no i'm not telling you a wrong but i am saying that we need to not let those things control us and we need to at least have a mind set you know i could live
310.23,314.79, not have this mountain of debt over my head if i'm willing to live a little bit differently
314.88,376.53, the rest of the world you're exactly right and what i like about waiting on god is that you know it's him i mean when he provided you the money to build this building you knew it was him i mean that you're not acting in the flesh and going ahead and doing something in the same same is true for us personally i mean my wife drove the same car for seventeen years i mean we used to call it puff because the best smoke two come out the back but it was paid for and not having that monthly car payment allowed us to make so much more progress in the rest of our finances so patient and being contempt in which is a big thing you know contentment mentioned seven times in the bible six times it has to do with money who and so for us to learn as paul did and in flippant for he learned to be content in any situation in which it is not exactly normal in our culture exactly but it's really key for us or anstruther's a story about a young couple
376.62,395.1, who wondered soon after their wedding where it all the money go hundreds of wedding details went off without a hitch but it was only a short time into their marriage when chris and cherry colman realized their household finances were out of control
395.31,414.66, the first we first get married it was extremely thitherward wasn't i use wisdom with a finances and we had more going out than we did coverin sandwiches and the simplest food were stables at the dinner table even fast food was considered a luxury
414.66,523.2, despite everything chris and cherry remained faithful to god within though the finances on the i felt sure is that we have to tie the inwoven if we don't have the money to do a thing as their family grew remaining faithful became tougher as their dead increased to take care of me who cares the knowledge to her whatever but now etienne responsibility of someone else that you are responsible for taking care of me consulate have all there indeed men prisoner search for ways to improve their finances when god led them to some practical solutions people say you know if i only had this much money now much i would do with it orlowska the practical thing what are you doing what you aright now over time the commanderie god as they committed to give tides put money into sassari some indulgences and began paying off debts that not insidiously knowing was faithful to the command family through many lean seasons they continued to honor him in spite of severe financial challenges every time it seemed they were running out of resources god provided a way we get likenesses
523.68,528.9, intimately familiar with it because they work for us to have and
528.9,532.23, i remember the stress that i would see
532.41,533.88, and
534.06,544.5, they were under that burden of that art or even maybe the hope was no softening that they could never own their own home and then through getting some counselling and some
544.68,547.38, help and making some decisions
547.38,549.3, really starting to
549.9,561.36, god beyond just our pay check yes know so many people just look to their pay check and if if they're under pressure at home they get mad at their bows and retorts
561.69,567.75, not really fair i mean you got complete of your paycheck you should make what you're worth that your job
567.75,573.15, so many people go get themselves in debt and then the matter everybody else because they don't have enough money in
573.15,585.9, that's not right and i'll watch them be faithful and diligent over a long period of time and now they in their own home they don't have that stress and pressure and god bless them in a number of ways and so we show these testimonies so
585.93,588.09, other people and no
588.09,608.16, god does for one he will do for another i know you probably heard thousands of testimonies like that eh that's right and to me it's just a joy to see couples to individuals who are in financial difficulty learn what god says about money and apply those principles over period of time and sometimes it happens quickly
608.19,626.58, the time to take a long time but it's the key is to be faithful to fly those principles as they were to to be generous givers as they were to to make those sacrifices on their aniculis where they don't eat out so that they can create some surplus in that budget
626.67,635.85, of theirs where they can pay down those debts and begin to save for the purchase of their house right you know we can't using the word faithfulness and diligence and
635.91,646.2, patience and you know i just want to stress how important it is for people to realize that it is going to take time it does you know we're not offering common instant overnight
649.14,652.47, problem that it may be to years to get into but
652.68,654.06, it is possible
654.51,658.38, it is god's will and if we do what we can do
658.71,664.05, god will do what we cannot do that's right and like them they started really trying to get out of debt
664.11,665.52, and they started
666.06,670.08, sacrificing where they could then they started having these
670.32,675.39, miraculously in open where somebody would send them money or are they get a refund
675.42,680.97, but they didn't know that they overpaid and so often we want miracles from god
681.42,692.34, we're not really even doing what we can do that's right exactly right i like to tell people there's god's part when it comes to handling her money and there's our part our responsibilities and gone
692.4,707.76, he's the one who provides for us and our part is we need to be faithful as you said to work hard to be absolutely honest spend wisely to give generously all these things once we've done that then we can be content
707.85,728.61, that in the words time he's going to put us in a better place that's exactly right well yesterday at the close of the program when we're talking about your money mpande didn't get very far i'm sure that some people are saying i want to know about the rest of that map so we just want to go for a few more of these things you seven things you suggest the people do that can come to help them and warn his
728.67,730.95, thousand dollar emergency fund
730.95,734.61, then have a spending plant on train but i have a plan
734.64,738.57, you say save one month's living expenses
738.72,771.18, work toward pan of credit cards yea the big picture joyce is that there are seven destinations on the journey to providential freedom and the with beenie was we had the long term vision of becoming totally debt free free to do anything because our investments would be providing our income we wouldn't have to earn a salary so we recognize that we were never going to reach that dream if we didn't have smaller achievable destination along the way and that's really what the crown money map is is all about i tell you
771.21,785.4, you are where you want to go ultimately and the next step and destination too if you pay off that plastic be relentless in working to pay off your your credit cards and you save one months living expense
785.46,797.55, that's done then you start to focus on your other consumer deaths like your car seventy per cent of all the automobiles are financed in our country to day so pay that rascal of an end save
797.58,804.06, three months living expensive at each destination you be dotcom financially more stable

849.18,860.01, you know it's good to have long term and short term goals that's right and so it's great to just think i just want to get my life bill paid but i think people should have a goal
860.07,861.21, that
861.21,864.51, some people never get out of that mentality

989.4,1003.65, i will were back with crown financial founder howard day talking about some issues concerning finances
1003.86,1008.24, i think given us some some good insight lots of things to
1008.24,1016.28, think about it now if you will me i'd like to revert back to one of my teaching series for a few men i will you wait in on some of these things great 
1017.09,1024.32, i did a series on finances and one of the teachings with eight reasons why we have lacheneur life
1024.32,1031.43, and you know i had plenty of that my life in the past actually i like to share with people the first time that i
1032.0,1033.47, in public
1033.8,1044.72, in front of a real congregation i had to borrow a suit from my pastor's wife wife because i didn't have any really decent clothes i sing at that time and so i know what it's like
1044.87,1046.16, without
1046.19,1048.56, i've watched god change that
1048.65,1052.22, my life over the years through applying his principles
1052.28,1058.79, so i had to start looking for reasons in my life why are had such like you know a lot of times was
1058.94,1072.05, wish we had somebody else is we wish things weren't this way but wishing doesn't really change anything night we have to take action so the first thing that i remember god the anthem about was having a poverty minds
1072.23,1073.79, when i was growing up
1073.97,1079.52, i must have heard a million times we can't afford it we can't afford it we can't afford it or
1079.52,1080.39, now
1080.42,1099.08, you know we do not the kind of people you know we can't afford that we're not in that class are you know we'll never have there will never have that so i had a poverty minetta that affects people who absolutely and insignificant way in the ireena it was just the reverse of that my
1099.08,1121.88, dad was a business guy he was an obscene and so i was taught from an early age you can do anything and the difference between those two is really significant and i think again knowing where we are in christ that we are his children that he does care for us and love us and i want the best for us hopefully
1121.88,1129.2, knowing that what god says about handling money can break that poverty mentality which i think cripples a lot of people
1129.32,1137.93, you know like one of the things that i can remember doing like years ago is i would always buy they had a day old bread section in the store
1137.93,1139.61, i would always buy the
1139.91,1152.87, they all bread or bread those a couple of days old and and if i'm going to eat bread i really like really fresh breath yes but i persisted in buying the stale bread because i had that
1153.26,1169.19, that and it wasn't really that much cheaper it was just i think at that time like ten cents and i remember one day when i was in the store and i was already teaching the word in all believe in god for a change and many things in my life one of them being
1169.22,1176.51, our financial needs being met and he said he has put my heart don't you really think that i can afford that ten cents for you to have the fresh bread
1177.08,1182.3, it was a big step of faith honestly to go ahead and by the fresh bread and that that may sound ridiculous
1182.39,1184.7, that was like where i was at at the time
1184.88,1185.99, so
1186.5,1189.23, cannot give us anything we're not willing to have
1189.5,1197.72, we have to learn how to to follow a hard and i didn't say follow our flesh i said follow her heart but i find so many people
1198.11,1200.57, poor self image and
1201.32,1202.79, even think that
1203.3,1216.5, they should or could have thy slaves get stuck in that well grandma did amadeo i guess always will and it just doesn't have to be that way no and again if we're faithful
1216.5,1259.7, to even be faithful and small little things in our financial life that puts us in a position where the lord can and trust more to so i think we ought to be generous with a sense of expectation you know ruth the lord going to do i don't know how it's going to loneliness you know i'm not going to put him in a box because he's the lord of the interest i'm not but i do have an expectation that in some some way the lord is going to entrust more resources to me once we've been faithful in other words wait on god and we hear a lot about waiting on god and i think we look at waiting on god like this passive when all agonies something but if you study the word wait
1260.21,1265.61, even in the amplified bible and brings it out very clearly it says that to wait on god meant
1265.73,1269.87, look long for and expect god
1270.11,1272.87, so we really do need to live
1273.2,1275.72, expectation i love what god told
1275.9,1279.05, at a point in his life where he had lost everything
1279.14,1283.46, go to the top of the mountain and looked north south they used to west and whatever you see
1283.76,1285.32, give it to 
1285.41,1289.67, sometimes we need to ask ourselves well what do i see
1289.88,1291.29, possible
1291.32,1295.85, my future perhaps some of our precious viewers today of dust got such a mess around them
1296.03,1305.69, all they see is lacking and just you know bills and they just feel like that they'll never get out of the mess at the inn and i really want encourage people to day to
1305.93,1313.43, i got and not let the poverty minded ahold of you were you to say like you can never ever
1314.24,1325.04, anything other than what you've seen in the past that of course going along with that as god had ditte about poverty mouth and i you know what i mean by that is as you know we have to be very careful
1325.76,1333.2, what we say i mean i don't think that we should be going round all the time saying i can't afford it i can't afford it can afford an ever babloo that on the havanese have a new house
1333.35,1339.83, we know that there's power in words of power life and that is enormouth arose why not start saying some things that
1340.1,1367.19, sound like they've got some faith in him gave gunson to work with that right and nothing big part of it is heaven that close relationship with christ and asking him you know what should our financial life look like in the future and an what should i be doing to day that will position is to be in a better position financially in the future another word by your still in trouble start asking god to show you
1367.43,1373.73, you can do to get out of trouble and then be faithful and doing it to the art thing i have that will really affect people and cause lack
1373.76,1376.01, jealousy and envy
1376.04,1377.75, it's pretty difficult
1377.87,1379.82, you're really a man of something
1380.21,1382.04, somebody else get it
1382.43,1391.34, he genuinely happy now i find that to be a real challenge sometimes but i honestly think that sometimes god will test us
1392.18,1395.75, putting somebody in front of us that has received what we want
1397.04,1400.25, say we're going to trust him for his plan for our life
1400.82,1407.6, get a bad attitude will i think more than anything the lord wants to velo our character
1407.69,1417.59, that it would conform to the person of christ and that when we have the wrong attitude i do think that often hill with hold things from us
1417.68,1431.81, because he's mostly in on developing our character and it may be disciplined that he's inflicting on us at the moment ultimately to develop that gable character what just like you wouldn't give 
1433.94,1435.02, a
1438.41,1441.95, had already shown you that you couldn't trust him in other areas of tried
1442.01,1443.48, you might want to
1443.69,1449.93, you save for you keep it farm but you're going to teach him some things aristander right god does
1449.93,1466.73, the teacher sometimes how i handle things properly and he did really doesn't want us to be jealous and envious because the bible tells us that were not to cover the right what other people have is actually one of the the big tin and we need to realize god has a plan for us and just try to develop
1466.94,1468.74, a being happy
1468.98,1477.41, other people and in the sand god i know that you have a plan for me as a we've got about thirty seconds left her hard before i have to close so
1477.56,1497.45, the last closing comments that you'd like to make well joe would just encourage people to learn what god says about handling money and that how you handle money has a huge impact on your intimacy and your relationship with christ look sixteen eleven tells us if we're not faithful neworld well who will trust us with the true riches and
1497.57,1515.0, true riches is that in a relationship with christ and there's plain practical things you can do to get your finances in order based on the word of god but it's that intimate relationship with quiet christ that's the dearest thing on this planet thank you somewhat
1515.18,1524.42, offering some resources as always and we always do this is sure were on the program were going to offer us some teaching resources because
1524.42,1529.31, i know that the only thing is really going to change your life is the word of god that's what change my
1529.4,1536.39, to change yours so if anything you heard they struck a cordon you are you thinking well you know i really do need to change some things then
1536.48,1551.84, what you had to day was more or less like a little spiritual smack but you need to have some full course of meals on this subject so we want to get these teachings and in this book that were offering so you can really have financial freedom so were offering a debating
1552.08,1555.56, the cause of the cure for financial deficiency
