11.7,13.77, people in the back
13.95,17.82, that no power back there i know i was sitting there
18.54,22.68, i talk to you about dangerous ideas and a lot to think
23.19,26.91, reimers for giving me the chance to
26.91,29.01, talk about dangerous ideas
29.34,31.5, our industry
31.5,34.74, when we go to events to spend a lot of time focusing on
35.16,40.5, how do we get better at typography how do we think about content
40.65,41.67, more
41.67,50.52, effective way how do we get better layout interaction as i overall very important and very essential things to what we all do which is making stuff
51.12,54.69, a set of issues and questions
54.69,59.37, challenges that are also central to us and what we all want to do
59.73,61.74, that we don't talk about very often
61.74,63.63, because we are afraid to
65.01,66.06, and
68.01,84.0, the talking about things that scare us things that make us uncomfortable that's really the only place where a lot of the progress that we want to see happen in our industry in our companies in the kind of work we produce for a client and for ourselves is only when we get ourselves a little bit uncomfortable
84.06,86.76, probably in the space where we have the most to grow
87.39,93.84, i feel honored to be able to have the opportunity to talk to you about some things that will probably make you uncomfortable
95.04,96.57, you a little bit
98.79,104.16, also hopefully if i do a good job have the effect of allowing you to think about all the work that you do
104.46,106.17, in a different way
109.35,113.67, my work and all of your work i like to think of us all as people who
113.67,122.61, the masters of ideas it's our job to either develop ideas for things or take ideas that are around us from clients from users
122.64,128.34, figure out how to integrate them together and actually manifest them in the world through something were all
128.37,131.55, masters of ideas and we try to be the masters of ideas
134.25,136.2, first idea
137.85,141.18, to offer to you which is scary to us
141.33,143.73, the notion that everyone is a designer
143.94,151.14, that everyone in the world in some fashion whether they are aware of it or not whether they were articulate what they do this way or not
151.2,154.86, manipulate ideas in the world they do it to
155.25,180.69, talking about how it shall a child organizes their place that how they build a lego construction whether talking about a chaffinches these are all people who are acting with the war word design they are designing things and if you go around in the world you pay attention and you look more carefully or more with more open mind you can see acts of engineering and design going on by ordinary people all the time
181.83,198.36, at the checkout counter when the really what should be a really simple interface for paying for stuff with debt carter credit card had some post at one label that was put there by the cashier because her sick of answering the question every time but which button to push
198.48,209.43, a kind of editorializing design that goes on all the time in the world and you think of all the little habits that we have we manipulate an object that was designed for one purpose and then use it for some other purpose
209.61,228.27, just habituated this we see someone else too and we learn it and just becomes part of how we behave in the world these are all acts of design if you think of what you do is an engineer or as a designer or as a writer there some problem that you're dealing with you develop some kind of proposed solution and then you go and build it
228.54,233.4, see cycles were goes on for ordinary people lay people all the time
236.01,257.4, sometimes assigned doesn't work out that well now not to be fair to be fair all design above traitors and all engineering above trade off and many the complaints that you get from your customers or your users about some of the things that you did you know exactly why that trade off was necessary
257.4,265.47, so the trade off thar was necessary here is to provide all of you with the feature of having power at your chair
265.62,269.85, certain trade off was required somehow that power has to make it too you
270.84,285.39, course i don't know exactly what the other options were in terms of how big that can do it had to be and the labeling is someone entertaining especially when people only noticed the caution sign after the tumbled on something in throughout watch
285.39,303.48, since we are here talking about us research actually spent some time sitting in the corner allotted a i provide you in about exactly how i got a bad tea design was so turned about one and twenty
303.81,309.48, stumbled that redoubled for people who were really paying attention which i didn't really feel so bad about
309.57,316.5, for the number of people here who actually are using power which i think is probably at least half of you percent of you could artevelde off
316.89,338.01, one person who stumbles five people get power i mean i don't know as not you i can work out anyway i offer that as an example of design is around us all the time and people design things that we use we don't think of them as engineers we don't think of them as interaction designers to think of them as content creators but really if you put that london you can see the world and a much more interesting way
339.48,345.33, be dangerous for us because we don't want to make it seem like it's easy and trivial to do it we do but
345.72,347.82, get wider us to
347.85,369.27, people's kitchens and how people organize their space and on her who cooks now those how important is you want to put things in the right place is a french word for it esemplastic is about organizing things and peppino kitchen you can use your properly and you go to the free homes or houses you can see this an infinite number of ways people choose to design the environment to do live and work in and that is a kind of design
369.54,402.84, this actually a book some of the pictures that have shown are from this book by jane curse a researcher and i believe a designer at idea and the book is called thoughtless act and its collection of photographs like the ones at that show you and it's a fantastic book a highly it's really a bunch of pictures is not a lot of analysis or data but it's a reminder to anyone who make stuff for a living which is all of you about how we are all makers and if you do is professionally you are part of this larger community of people who
403.2,406.74, with the world and change it hopefully for the better
407.16,409.17, now the problem
409.35,410.64, danger
410.67,412.68, in that we
413.25,418.35, is that when we deal with a client who believed to heavily that there are designer
418.5,422.64, they think that because they like to call her blue that everything should be blue
422.85,439.47, they've heard a few phrases from madmen or some o t show that they use that phrase again and again about wanting something that has more sizzle or that's great but can you make it up and we all have these experiences with perused
440.07,461.07, but a very negative way to look at what is imposing is an inherent quality in our species we tend to design all of us do it and if we are offended or upset every time someone steps on our toes or hurts her ego by pretending they can do it we do and we had angry about them we could angry about it 
461.1,464.13, we are resistant to what is a natural instinct for all people
464.31,483.06, there's a much better way to deal with people in your world in in your workplace when they infringe on your sensibility for your expertise so instead of saying you know this really socks i've got to climb again for my boss thinks he can do it i do instead of looking at it that way there's a much more positive way to look at it which is
483.36,488.16, the designer or an engineer that just really really bad
488.34,493.74, horrible at it but they are in fact doing design it is really bad
493.98,502.2, if you would into that world view you lie yourself to see people your co workers in your clients and your boss
502.23,507.57, that perspective that gives you a very powerful opportunity that instead of being
508.92,511.08, in lines
511.26,517.92, being the person who's the cranks person in the room who always seem offended by everything it empowers you to become a leader
518.28,537.51, now willing to explain them what they don't understand you want to pull them aside and explain to them that the color blue simply because they like it doesn't define an esthetic resent a fine aesthetic for the gold of particular project or thousand little things that annoy you and send seeing that as a negative you see that the positive and that your job as a creator
537.51,549.09, so a master at working with ideas is to help other people get better working with ideas to you see it that way now you become a leader in the kind of change in creating the kind of environment that you want around you
549.45,551.22, if you do see
551.73,559.05, you work with this simply being bad or uninformed at this particular craft the only way they ever going to get better
559.05,560.91, if you talk to them and teach them
562.65,570.24, of the challenge that doesn't get talked about very much in our industry is that you guys are all very special
570.3,579.6, the fact that you're here the fact that you're an engineer or a writer or a designer put you in the minority of kinds of work in the history of the universe
580.47,584.16, power the power to go and make stuff
584.37,589.29, of people the majority of the people ever worked in the history of our species have i had that power
590.37,594.87, side of having that power is that you will almost always be in the minority
595.2,599.97, almost always be working with people who don't have as much experience creating things as you do
600.3,603.03, and you can complain about that which many of us like to do
603.45,617.43, events like this end up feeling a little bit like support group where you all get together and share the same complaints and just talk about you the power and that that you realize you're not alone in your feeling but it's not productive power it doesn't change anything
617.73,632.43, to you change your world view of those things if you allow if you accept the possibility that everyone's a designer and the only way these people are going to be less sulky designers to less sulky engineers or less sulky writers is if you teach them now you're in charge
632.55,636.45, see them differently as an opportunity that you can take advantage of
639.21,642.81, so dangerous idea i have for you is about the word power
644.85,655.38, my career i've had many different roles i've worked as usability engineer i've worked as interaction designer but i spent most of my career working as a team lead managed team to people
655.77,664.29, and the main reason for that change wasn't because i was frustrated with design or frustrated with doing years of research i like doing those things
664.5,672.6, a complaint that i had the problem i had as i spent a lot of time basically giving advice to people who could then choose to accept it or reject it
673.98,682.77, i felt that why am i on the side line so to speak giving something to someone else point make a decision about the design
683.04,686.97, the engineering why am i in an advisory role
687.9,691.05, i want to be the decision maker about these things that affect his
691.44,698.61, so i changed into a role where i recognized in the environment that i worked in that was how i had actual power
698.82,700.47, how things were built
700.5,704.19, what i care about i wanted to have an impact on how things are actually built
704.22,714.24, so there is a little exercise that you can do and you in your work place in your world to think about what is it you really have power over and there is there's a spectrum
714.54,721.95, i like to think of in the whole realm of ideas and in one end of the spectrum that most powerful creepers is what we would call an artist
722.19,725.58, get up in the morning or in the afternoon
725.7,729.72, the evening and they go to the campus
729.81,731.01, they paid
731.19,733.8, whatever they want on the campus
734.43,738.96, by whatever pain they can afford but they go to the campus they put whatever they want
739.08,749.1, a race it whenever they want they can start over whenever they want they can call it done whenever they want that is an artist that is so was in complete control of the thing they are making
749.43,755.1, answer to anyone is no debate is to stakeholders is no committees it's just the
755.19,756.3, an artist
756.96,772.86, in the middle is a designer or an engineer that there's some set of decisions that are made for you by your boss by your client some set of decisions that affectation sometimes in very significant ways that are made by someone else and in the same sub set that you get to make
773.1,775.83, dion when you work that's a bigger or smaller pile
775.86,792.6, and then you you further along into the lesson less powerful the advisory role which is sort of how i describe being a user researcher that you put together some analysis you write a report you offered to someone else they read their port and they decide how much of it they're going to follow and you make recommendations that's your output
793.17,797.34, of course on the total and is just being lacson goes around and get coffee
797.4,800.52, you know scheduled meeting for people i don't know
801.51,803.43, somewhere in there is 
803.97,809.28, you have to decide for yourself the complaints that you have about the quality of work that you make
809.76,815.73, you feel when you be able to remedy those problems if you moved somewhere else on that spectrum
816.93,819.42, in many cases the answer is yes
820.11,824.04, many cases the answer is yes you always complain i won't have no budget
824.46,825.87, did the budget
826.32,829.05, the person whose job is the side the budget
829.44,833.76, one more choice over the clients you pick some one has that job
834.24,837.24, probably not someone in a specialized creative role
840.09,848.67, if you can palestina bunch of different ways this is one way to visualize you can imagine the big circle is all the decisions that go on in a project
848.73,852.21, the little circle is the one that you know you have complete control over
852.54,859.68, for many creative and many engineers relative to the totality of a project that circle is really small
860.58,869.67, one side effect of working in vermont where you feel you a small degree of influence a small degree of control it you can't we tended to fend it
870.18,872.16, every defensive about it
872.43,881.43, at people who criticize us or who don't understand us we hunterdon and become very defensive but the limited territory that we have
885.03,892.59, we want to have more impact more influence on the quality of the ideas that have our names on them that go out the door that's not going to work
892.83,898.38, a small degree of influence and control and protecting it doesn't make things any better it just keeps what you have tact
899.22,915.75, a designer i often from the beginning a few examples of real world design designed it's not about website and can actual design in the real world and fan to those examples because people who designed the in the real world there was much more challenging constraint than we do
916.98,918.75, challenging constraints
919.02,928.08, it's fascinating to be avoided or into other kinds of designs and i'm going to take you on a short little voyage to a kind of design that is called 
928.2,930.27, she called military history
931.11,933.99, in designing for military because
934.02,942.93, like some we take her so seriously that somehow we believe people's lives are at stake because of the navigation structure we put together with so worried about it
942.96,946.05, kind of designs for people's lives are literally at stake
946.05,948.06, designed a sword or an
949.77,957.3, all the cities you make will effect with the certain people will live die so my story i want to tell you is about a trip i took recently
957.69,958.95, to israel
959.25,967.59, i managed to go to messana which is what you see a picture of her it's a fortification that was built years ago on the top of a cliff face
968.13,983.13, fortification that was the retreat when there was a big war between the jews of israel the time and the romans the romans burned down jerusalem that some of the jews fled they went up to the top of the sand and it was his hide out and he had been engineered and built to be a high
983.13,994.71, first rate first class it up it had all this his walls his layers of walls even if some inmate to sneak up to the top somehow there were two layers of walls to cushion at
994.74,999.81, you can see in this picture in the background that the dead sea and behind it on the mountains of jordan
1000.5,1003.44, they had the systems of 
1003.44,1031.67, imagine if ever you fortify yourself in your office and didn't want to talk to any one for a while you know that you need supplies water or whiskey or his whatever his supply of choices all fine but you're going to hunger down protect yourself that's what you need so harosheth architect who designed this whole building had this huge system of sisters that all the rain water run off one from all the areas around with drains the huge vats of water
1031.73,1040.16, he would have water for as long as they needed to and you can see in this picture for scale the woman standing down there on the right is actually my wife
1040.25,1046.16, about five feet sentinels about five feet tall so that the thing is about eighty feet high
1046.16,1053.36, enormously amazingly engineer the best bunker built in the history of engineering this is probably a candidate for that
1054.05,1063.62, the problem though with bunkering down the metaphor is going to come back around to us and design a promise the problem with the hunkering down a unknown is it means you are no longer mobile
1063.89,1065.99, become fixed in your thinking
1066.71,1084.35, this case and the physical case become in your location but if you decide what your turpissima going to enter these questions on into this not going to talk about it deutsches people only to do that when you hunterdon philosophically and with ideas i mean is a whole bunch of questions you're never allowing yourself to ask again
1084.68,1087.41, would happen in this case on the top of the sad
1087.5,1091.34, because they were hoedown in the mobile the romans vinson out where they were
1091.37,1096.02, the fence all the way around the side six for open
1096.29,1098.21, they made it so no one can get in or out
1098.51,1107.0, they decided you can see there's a rectangular thing on the right this rectangular area on the right the romans will issue in campman
1107.18,1113.87, i decided they were going to build a wall built this embankment to come up to the top messalinda through
1114.2,1130.28, you can imagine what it must have been like to stand at the top of the huge fortification that you'd spent years and years building and you're looking down at the thing you think is a fantastic fortification when the best ever bill and watch slowly as this tower gets built that you know you can't escape from because you have nowhere to go
1131.39,1136.55, so i told me just long story about my trip because if you have very little territory
1136.7,1138.56, you feel unmowed
1138.71,1140.78, always on the defensive
1141.08,1146.69, the walls and the fornications doesn't really help you at all towards the larger goals you probably have
1147.14,1154.16, gals you have the passion of gold you have about all these ideas you have in your mind that you want to express through your work
1154.64,1156.71, i will not help you
1156.95,1159.47, you have but it limits you as well
1160.16,1174.17, there are other things that we do that i think limit us that habits that we fall into the kaiser in an industry in the many of us are enrolled that are in the minority in the organization that we work for we built up these little passive aggressive self defensive habits
1174.56,1176.99, includes the language that we use
1178.31,1182.09, language that we use it doesn't really help us very much
1182.72,1190.67, so i travel a lot i invited into organizations and companies to talk some about or listening about how they were other worthies figure out creative processes
1190.91,1194.81, companies the better work to go out of the door
1195.59,1200.51, one of the first things i listen to is how actual projects talk to each other
1201.26,1203.6, language do they share with each other
1203.84,1209.0, and i find almost all the time the more jargon is being used
1209.45,1214.22, the less the lower the quality of the project team will produce
1214.79,1220.58, he are working together passionate smart people who like each other work together all the pretense drops away
1221.21,1224.75, focussed on words like problem and solution
1224.75,1227.93, an experiment is focused on the work
1228.02,1234.17, i never focused on the work jargon is almost always focused on the person speaking trying to sound smart
1235.43,1242.54, trying to blind side you into something by using words that they know you don't know and they know you're afraid to ask what they mean
1243.5,1252.14, the apostle prays that i like to like to say whenever i norman the lot of jargon whoever's using the most jargon actually has the least confidence in their ideas
1254.48,1257.36, you really believe in your ideas you wouldn't need any jargon
1258.11,1262.46, talk about the problem you talk about the customer you show your design that's all that you need
1262.94,1264.71, stuff
1265.7,1270.68, i think gorgias also attempt its often something done by people feel like they have little power
1270.68,1274.04, they need to control the vocabulary in order to feel like the one something
1274.25,1278.75, very weak thing to own because words are cheap words or from a writer i know this
1279.08,1282.44, anywhere i want for the entire dictionary same price
1282.65,1284.0, all three
1284.09,1286.64, any word i want i can make up words
1286.79,1292.55, free it doesn't make me any smarter doesn't make my ideas any better it's purely a kind of intimidation
1292.55,1297.8, kind of intimidation that people who are not that confident and what they actually have to say often end up using
1298.31,1306.41, i become systematic and consulting agencies or consulting firms build it and to their culture that these are the word preferred words to use
1306.56,1311.54, do people care deeply about ideas because it is distraction
1311.54,1314.96, it's an unfair tactics if you care about merit
1315.35,1317.15, rather than force
1317.48,1322.34, i want to say about power is that there's three different notions of power to think about
1323.72,1329.0, entire books on management about these things and i don't think that there
1329.33,1336.56, the concept is that complicated but it's useful to think about this treat frances the most common kind of power power that's granted
1336.59,1341.45, that means it's some one who already has power says this person is going to be the team manager
1341.51,1345.8, been granted to them by the virtue of their job title they have power
1347.36,1354.47, if they're not very good at their job even if no one will like working with them people still have to listen to them because they have granted power
1354.77,1361.61, all of us know a project manager or boss that we have worth with her for that we didn't think was that competent
1361.76,1367.1, with them anyway and we listen to the anyway the cause they had granted power
1367.61,1369.8, power is earning power
1370.94,1372.44, he earned
1372.98,1382.49, you work with the co worker you didn't know them at all she just treated them like i don't know it was wet work together and as you work with them their ideas were consistently good
1382.52,1386.36, collaborators the built up your respecting your trust
1386.63,1391.91, next time it's a difficult situation no one knows what the right answer is and they offer a suggestion
1392.33,1395.33, power in that situation because they have earned it
1395.33,1405.26, and by their reputation by their work that earned power and good organizations the people who have rantipole also people who have earned it but is not necessarily true
1405.71,1414.83, some situations the person who's the most highest ranking person in the room a very little and trust earth power from the team
1414.83,1421.67, and some one was actually very low and individual developed individual designer who has the most trust acts the most power in the room
1422.96,1429.17, to say about power is claiming power and this is the more machinery of my presentation
1429.44,1432.89, claiming power that sounds really subversive
1432.89,1439.52, when no one's looking at you know not so one on the head and take their seat or something and that's not as though what i mean
1439.67,1444.47, i think that there's power that all of you have that you are it's available to you
1445.55,1446.81, to claim it
1447.56,1455.39, teacher about this is about white boards how many of you work in an environment where there's white boards in most offices most rooms
1455.99,1463.22, all of the white board industry seems to be thriving and well in boston that fantastic buy stock in white board company
1464.15,1472.82, but this is something i've noticed as a traveler so one is in many meetings in many conferences were creativity or ideas or being discussed and developed
1472.94,1476.75, it is often a great deal of fear about who will go to the white boards
1478.76,1482.54, people were probably most qualified to go the white board first
1482.66,1483.89, you
1484.37,1491.57, if you go to the white board first giving away one of my tricks here to go to the wife porfurst you instantly gain power
1491.9,1502.67, where discussion would bring storming some problem on a design something or build something and i go to the wife portended you say something and i go the white board ago do you mean this what do you mean this
1503.54,1511.07, now changed the conversation from being abstract and verbal to being specific and visual
1511.49,1524.12, powerful we are visual creatures were all visual creatures even people who don't like to look at pictures you can people only read books the one on a red artaxerxes or colonists are based on visual
1524.96,1526.25, perception
1526.4,1543.53, so if you put yourself when you claim that role which any of you were designers even many who are engineers your mind not even be great drawing things but you're good at conveying ideas visually if you put yourself in that role you instantly gain a certain kind of credibility and you change the quality of the conversation in the room
1544.73,1557.36, many white words in many a different work places a senior ones are sprayed on the walls and seen all different kinds of things i get to see a sign above them that says you have to be a certain rank to go to the white board first
1559.46,1561.41, power is available to you
1561.74,1578.75, your power with ideas your ability to create and think about it is for the better then become after solicitor in the room not just to draw your own ideas but help other people and visualize an express the conversation you can change the conversation for the better there's no one else is going to do that
1579.26,1585.53, you so if you guys sit there and your thinking i totally know what he's talking about but it's not explaining it very well
1586.73,1588.56, stand up and do something about it
1588.98,1595.7, you don't do that and there's no one else probably in the room the cat is probably no one else in the room is even thinking thinking that thought
1596.6,1601.97, my third dangerous idea for you scary idea has to do with
1604.28,1606.74, specialization and generalization
1609.41,1610.85, if you look at
1612.59,1615.47, any function any job role
1615.5,1623.51, specific expertise i make wine on a wigmaker that's what i do if you look above them or in the example you look broader than them
1623.93,1627.92, some point you can one level up and maybe you have like the lead which it makes
1628.16,1635.39, team the team manager for the wicket makers also specialized with a manager of the specializations at some point you go up
1635.45,1638.09, a person who is not a special seymore
1639.2,1649.64, this kind of jargon a parlance that's the general that's the person we're all the specializations now line up every designer every engineer every writer they all report into one person
1650.09,1652.73, the general manager the general rule
1653.42,1657.44, the person who has a lot of power over what makes for
1657.83,1661.79, power over engineering decisions and designed decisions that are not
1661.88,1663.41, i called those things
1663.62,1669.38, schedule time line direction vision those are all things set by some one who's in a general's role
1669.89,1687.05, a lot of what ends up going on for people who are in specialized rolls a lot of my clear respect in a generous rome would manage teams of people with very diverse disciplines now with the the unification point of all those things when i worked as a specialist i used to have all this pressure and
1687.14,1690.68, sense of urgency around what would go on and big meetings
1690.74,1701.27, people people people bloodstains were all the special train room we are arguing over which to this without and used to tell a lot of pressure about what was happening there
1701.63,1707.6, i feel that if i didn't speak up and represent my discipline my discipline my role my perspective would not get her
1708.56,1714.05, when i am generalist i learned the whole another layer of what goes on
1714.14,1715.79, nothing 
1716.33,1723.62, the meeting is the notion of the meeting itself is a very powerful misrepresentation how decisions are made in most organizations
1723.92,1726.47, organizations but but most of them
1726.77,1732.02, and there's this notion about rooms and this division of influence
1733.16,1735.83, power and out of the power
1735.98,1737.51, no power
1737.81,1752.12, you're an abate in discussion were going to go with this design or action or this design direction and you're in the room and you're a high ranking person or you have a lot of influence and you speak up that's in room power if you can effectively convey an idea to people at once
1752.15,1756.2, fight for a point of view that many people around that's in room power
1756.29,1763.67, your skills are rhetoric and debate and persuasion with large groups of people are meeting sistrums of people is good that's in romper
1764.99,1768.11, power which seems less important
1768.17,1771.56, many organizations is the most important kind of power to have
1771.71,1776.54, power i mean this in sitting in a meeting with this bunch of people here
1776.66,1780.05, and this guy is actually the head boss what's your name
1781.58,1788.66, okay and he is in charge and as immediate and the three of us are disagreeing which struction to go
1788.75,1795.02, out of the meeting when the meeting is over i catch him in the hallway or asking for coffee and a conversation with him
1795.17,1796.7, mind
1796.91,1798.92, meaning is now a relevant
1799.28,1800.69, decision maker
1800.69,1802.73, the decision whenever we want
1802.85,1807.71, in the meeting is not entirely a pretence but to very different context
1808.01,1814.73, social psychology behavioral psychology we all know that people behave differently to pen who was around
1814.82,1825.77, he's in a meeting he is the powerful decision maker and this ten people in the room tempered for him ten people who complain in about certain things when he is in that room he has the pressure of all those contents at the same time
1826.34,1829.61, a difficult situation to persuade any one of anything
1830.42,1838.13, catch him privately i catch him alone catchin a different context of its formal it's just a two of us in a room we can speak more frankly
1838.49,1842.39, power and implores much greater a acome ing with any one in more
1843.02,1857.57, in point of power this is something i didn't really discover until i became the person who actually had that much influence as an individual i always thought the battle was in the meeting i for the men i had a brig hand up to them at that meeting centric
1859.22,1861.05, opposite is actually true
1861.98,1876.56, wreaths and coming back to all three of these things about being the ambassador for good ideas about power and by gentle rolls as asking the question for your own ideas
1877.43,1880.67, how much of your own energy are you willing to put behind them
1883.04,1887.36, argue halicti onsetting is right
1887.66,1890.51, my boss isn't go for it and the clinton go for it
1891.11,1892.34, problem
1893.24,1895.64, my problem i spoke up
1896.69,1899.66, complain for the rest of the project they didn't do it i wanted
1900.29,1904.28, the right fotherby for us
1905.51,1909.59, question then becomes when in your career you're going to decide
1909.74,1911.75, not enough
1911.87,1918.86, your sense of the value of your own idea is significant enough that you want a do more than that
1920.09,1926.96, now i am not saying this plenty of clients and bosses that putting in that much of yourself is not more ended
1927.62,1929.18, grant you that
1929.57,1931.7, in your career
1932.75,1937.49, sometimes when he is wanted
1937.58,1954.86, on our going to be able to figure that out so the question ask yourself then when was a last time it you were that guy who after the meaning you went down the line and he that talk to you i caught your totally later talk to you more about the pitch i ad a follow up with you
1954.98,1957.08, some percentage of the time
1957.29,1964.55, if you're not one to do that for your own ideas you as the creator he is the maker you don't want defour own ideas
1964.58,1968.24, crazy to expect anyone else to do that for your ideas either
1968.66,1975.47, stand up and be accountable and be truly passionate match the passion you have for your ideas with action in the world
1976.07,1978.17, that's a very dangerous idea
1978.59,1980.51, very very passionate
1981.59,1987.11, manifest that passion to actively or pragmatically in a work environment
1987.41,1990.08, very different day that's a very scary thing
1990.74,1992.75, and my four point for you
1994.97,1996.71, to do with
1998.81,2000.91, framing framing the problem differently
2001.54,2017.68, and the turtelot of my early work experience sails was taken care of this sale team as a different group my job was just demange to come up with that as enveloped them and ship them manage the people were doing the same thing to sales which is to other as foreign entity
2017.74,2021.19, sold but i just thought because lights are so awesome
2021.28,2026.23, vessels easy to itself like oaks in order much more
2027.28,2037.24, i have a very high opinion of sales i never really worked it done telemarken horrible telemarken experience when i was like i never really thought of sales as something that i needed to do or know much about
2038.11,2043.45, i had this other experience years ago where i was on vacation is on the beach
2043.45,2054.25, i was watching you all been to the beach and you see there the vendors who walk around from person to person selling cakes little necklaces little things and i remember watching them and thinking about you know
2055.84,2057.79, this is what he's doing
2058.18,2060.25, his job is roll
2060.61,2062.71, he created in her to find it
2062.89,2065.2, most of his job is rejection
2065.83,2067.96, from person to person
2068.35,2071.68, sell something and mostly getting rejected
2072.13,2077.05, as i watched this person do this i had connected
2078.34,2085.87, connected me to my own feelings about working with ideas and what i know about the history of people who operates writers musicians and artists
2085.96,2090.7, designers and developers that if your ideas are a good
2090.85,2095.95, even if your idea good a lot of time pitching to people and getting rejected
2096.61,2106.3, one part of the process and i thought of it all the things that i had to do for my team for my own ideas and i think about it now so primarily now a writer i write books
2106.33,2117.4, from magazines and have been successful and people assumed because i have been successful five an idea for magazine article i can just call up someone for you go another that you read it said to them and published it
2117.46,2122.05, my parablist contain
2122.08,2123.73, the pitch
2123.73,2130.9, move you see every t v show you watch everything has been pitched dozens or if not hundreds of times
2130.93,2133.81, creator before that idea landed somewhere
2135.28,2150.49, or thinking about the fact that everyone has the pitch ideas and a lot of what you do as a maker someone a works with ideas is not only developed things and build things but convince other people to value the potential value of mediator something to be built
2151.12,2153.34, a lot of the task that we do
2153.46,2159.13, pointing to pitching to actual pitching ideas in the formal sense of pitching
2159.31,2168.19, into asking for more resources for something asking for more schedule these are all pitches his all attempts to ask for something you don't have
2168.49,2173.35, what i do right now is a kind of pitching i'm trying to convince you guys at the value of the things i'm saying
2173.35,2176.47, about pitching
2180.85,2186.79, if you don't see sails as a pejorative if you realize its essential theme in your work
2187.27,2194.74, so again and again and all the little tasks all the things you need to have happened for your grand ideas to get manifested
2194.83,2197.11, comes a potential asset
2198.1,2201.22, comes the reason why one person
2201.28,2205.36, successful with their ideas is not even because of the quality of their ideas
2205.69,2207.73, persuasive
2207.85,2214.96, passion the wiessow up and pitch and pitch and pitch and worn from those pitches
2214.99,2220.54, at what i said except that what could i have done differently in my pitch
2220.9,2224.08, you need me to say or talk about that might have convinced you
2224.77,2229.15, it is a care part of what you do you're add to about its very different
2229.72,2234.64, i pity on the unavoidable aspect of
2234.64,2236.92, and
2237.16,2245.59, to develop certain kinds of christ not nearly physical carisma but caribou how you describe your ideas so that other people resonate with them
2246.04,2251.35, just being surprised and offended when people don't understand why you see it and ideas being so important
2252.46,2256.93, design management instituted event that i attended where
2257.08,2264.34, design manager samantha doria was talking about this course still that she cares about which his talk to people she doesn't like
2264.67,2271.03, the roles she needs support from to get her ideas through the organization out to clients
2271.03,2273.28, on talking to people she doesn't like
2273.85,2276.22, a county because there's a budget issue
2276.7,2280.42, senecas the sum they want to build they don't have to do that yet
2280.48,2284.44, because in order for the said iowaka they need support for it
2284.83,2290.35, to people you don't like and the sound like a really strange and odd thing they call out
2291.28,2295.24, most of us who are engineers and builders
2295.42,2298.66, pursued our careers largely to avoid other people
2300.13,2303.16, all of our times tearing it screens
2304.84,2306.31, i
2306.34,2312.19, grant she of a species to spend as much time as possible not looking at each other a little bit odd
2312.19,2315.13, wonderful it's very empowering but a little bit odd
2315.25,2319.69, i think there's definitely something in us about
2319.72,2321.94, kind of interactions that we like
2322.0,2323.26, our
2323.44,2327.28, choice we make trying to avoid situations that make us uncomfortable
2328.87,2334.81, sometimes the best possible way that the most important thing you can do to develop an idea
2335.11,2340.03, prove the chances that it you really care about manifest itself in the world
2340.18,2342.85, the support of so anyway don't like talking to
2343.9,2345.67, that's the reality of it
2345.73,2354.64, and the thing that i learned over my career was the more powerful i became the more important advice the more time i am then of having spent people i didn't like
2355.48,2383.95, why that is maybe it's people who are at racers and later climbers are just more difficult people to deal with or the less pleasant oberon i don't know but my experience was as i became a general manager manager large groups of people my job became more and more about making sure those relationships in those interactions were actually functional and healthy to the people working for me the designers and developers writers and engineers they could have a clean landscape of cooperation inside the organization or with clients or the other groups
2384.34,2385.54, they work with
2385.78,2392.29, the last thing i want to say has to do last one sound is has to do with the with job titles
2393.79,2406.99, by language of talk about jargon before and i've mentioned that i've been in this industry for a long time and this a fascinating anthropological sociological study can do with the job piles that we've had our career
2407.05,2412.75, how the factionalism by which many of us make very strong claims about
2412.84,2426.1, development we say we do manner actually architect content to a specialist architect designer attentions like we have this long seelie all those words in all his language and have to say that as a generalist
2426.37,2428.17, a manager
2428.29,2429.76, i think that
2430.93,2434.38, attention to your output more than they do your label
2435.49,2438.7, if i'm good at getting stuff done
2438.73,2444.73, i am soon he's effective and trying to work with other people were effective
2444.82,2447.64, no matter what your job title is
2447.67,2454.9, becomes relevant it's not the job titles going to make no one a work with you independent of your ability
2455.38,2457.63, come across people who
2460.42,2465.52, believe that that's the way that they're going to achieve what they want is simply by changing their job title
2466.51,2474.76, the job tied on the label that we give ourselves that's where the power is it externally again instead of just focusing on saying however i'm a designer
2474.76,2480.52, writer i don't need any more labeling like that the verb for what i do should be my label
2480.52,2489.1, everything else would come out of producing good work reliably for other people and being available to share in the process of trying to make good things
2491.2,2493.87, a point for you has to do with
2495.4,2497.74, unavoidable nature of creativity
2497.89,2516.04, the work that i do a lot of writing that i do is about idea development not just like degeneration degeneration turns out to be pretty straight forward but i need development how do you take any of them something you think about the shower bring it to your group development propose at pertipole it the whole process how do you maintain good ideas
2516.13,2519.46, an organization or replies how do you
2520.57,2529.42, you get around the unavoidable challenge of trying to bring new better ideas to people when human nature is so focused and resistant
2529.51,2534.01, the change were so heavily hinged on status quo
2534.1,2538.24, his essential unavoidable element to be in creative
2538.24,2543.64, being progressive and that means that you will always be facing some kind of resistance
2544.21,2550.93, how good your idea is man how armour reputation is if you are pushing things forward you will face resistance
2555.07,2561.19, and of architecture for the same reason i'm a fan of historic warfare related things in the ninth
2561.28,2566.62, design of these things has so many constraints that we don't have to deal with and i find that empowering
2566.95,2570.1, so architecture unlike the work that most of us do
2570.16,2572.92, decisions made with permanence in mind
2573.19,2575.89, if you're going to build a museum or for
2576.04,2577.3, men
2577.48,2582.22, the specification is this will last for hundreds of years
2583.03,2586.27, constraints never never go anywhere near that
2586.33,2590.41, but on the fact that we know the things we make will be thrown away
2591.04,2597.49, you had to make a decision to design decision engineering decision for a hundred years you have to think about a really hard
2597.58,2603.16, cries now they're paying you to make some incident last that long they're going to think about it really hard to
2603.4,2610.48, those of constraints and challenges interest me so whenever i travel always looking for buildings and works of architecture
2610.54,2612.64, challenging in some way
2612.79,2622.75, go to those places and walk around and get inspiration from trying to figure out and think about how the people the designers the builders how they convinced their climb to do these things
2623.5,2626.65, he there were certain about their proach they took
2626.95,2633.1, so your boston there is a building institute pory art pictures showing here that's a really unusual building
2633.22,2635.89, odd things about this for museum
2636.64,2642.91, things that struck me about the building is how many of you have been good and i museum in new york city
2645.67,2663.1, culture is also so that's a definition of culture i guess the groaning so the problem with a good is that the several problems the guests are very boring buildings ten or because the whole idea
2663.1,2676.63, most or will look best in rectilinear shapes to the walls are always so there's a white opened a flat white color and that measuring things on the argumentive shapes but it's a blank canvas if you will for art
2676.99,2687.07, but in this building he made a bunch of unusual choices with angles as lots of rooms and are angled to the problem of the good and in a circular building
2687.34,2698.62, every ten the good in him a lot of the art there doesn't really look quite right but because you put a canvas on a curved wall when you walk up to it your whole frame of reference is very different than what the artist intended
2698.89,2706.54, artisan about this and they don't want to be shown in the spiral part of the building they wanted to show and the separate is actually a part of the building that that's not true for
2706.93,2715.78, anyway after is an example you guys are in boston man if you are not from here many are from here and have no interest in architecture but may be a teacher interest
2715.81,2723.31, as to go and buildings in the use that as motivation and inspiration for thinking about the challenge is that you should be taken on in your own work
2724.51,2727.36, to drive the point home
2727.45,2729.55, one could convince
2729.79,2730.9, it
2731.17,2739.72, the very wealthy people who putting lots of money into the design into the building is building for them if the designer the engineer could convince them
2740.02,2742.45, the concept of having these angular
2742.54,2744.64, for an art building
2745.27,2747.13, convince them do that
2747.34,2749.95, you should be convincing your client to do
2750.04,2752.65, your co worker to
2752.77,2758.68, interesting picture challenging pitch really balls he pitch have you made in the last month
2759.1,2760.45, six months
2762.55,2768.4, one thing to get turned down for pitch never even offered the pitch will whose problem is that
2768.97,2774.13, blame the person for saying no i never had the opportunity to even say yes
2777.43,2780.46, so the last note i want to close on 
2780.58,2786.01, a thing about about what i means to be creators what it is to be makers and designers and builders
2787.09,2789.97, a certain amount of things that
2790.15,2793.42, a certain set of questions a certain set of
2793.42,2796.6, action that only we are responsible for
2796.9,2804.85, really shouldn't depend on other people to do these things for us so in aesopus so in as to be willing to put their neck out for an idea
2805.24,2810.58, so as to do that so it's been the champion for creativity and for pushing me on estates
2811.24,2815.5, you guys dangerous idea the most dangerous i have is that you
2816.04,2824.62, you feel outnumbered you feel like you're on the sod a or the only person there fortifying yourself and building up more walls is not going to get you the environment that you want
2824.65,2827.23, achieve a kind of work that you want
2827.29,2831.25, you have to be won to put yourself behind those ideas
2831.67,2832.96, it happens
2833.08,2835.81, yourself to recognize that persuasion
2835.96,2838.93, other skills that aren't ritually thought of his building
2838.96,2841.12, thought of his creative
2841.15,2845.53, essential to your ability to get the ideas you do have manifested
2845.71,2846.88, in the world
2847.0,2848.83, so those are my photo credits
2848.89,2860.2, i want to thank you for paying attention and listening thank you if you are much
2865.39,2871.81, so i challenge you guys to be considered dangerous ideas so i'm happy to answer any question
2872.17,2874.12, it might be
2877.06,2887.26, can you start this i mean i've got kids in high school a middle school i mean how far back to you push this and lancinating still the sort of
2887.41,2895.87, ideas and little kids and you see that happening is it i think during pregnancy we start i think the attorney ending
2897.28,2900.85, the the best answer to that question
2901.84,2905.74, in the question i think the kids have this down at
2906.34,2907.69, make of
2907.84,2916.27, and it's kind of it's kind of inspiring away you can see i mentioned earlier on that we're all designers you watch kids are all creators
2916.48,2918.91, so make weird stuff
2918.91,2920.17, there making
2920.23,2929.98, somewhere along the way a common it's a combination i think over education system to companion a culture to combination of what we value
2930.1,2936.58, become adults and become professionals wanting to fit any one to get good grades that we filter a lot of those natural instincts out
2937.03,2943.48, whenever i'm asked to go somewhere and help a group more creative or help them work with ideas in a better way
2943.54,2947.26, and people the soul do this stuff instinctively
2947.68,2963.16, back into modes of play where it octopi work but you guys are in a different territory you guys do creative work all the time you guys are not in the average you guys are well above the average in terms of your own capacity for developing a that's what you do
2963.25,2970.96, to answer a question i think of working the other way and the kids have it right children ever right what should we be doing to protect that
2970.99,2975.61, professor pressed in to get good grades
2975.67,2977.68, as is not creative
2977.89,2982.63, trying to figure out what the right specific answer is it's nothing creative about that
2982.66,2987.46, revolutionary war start instinctive about that a singular answer
2987.46,2993.7, we protect that as we put people to a system a necessary system of a certain kind of achievement
2997.96,2999.88, in the
3000.54,3002.1, coming to me coming
3007.38,3017.52, how do you transform a culture that is driven by a consensus for decision making hortensius
3017.64,3019.23, state
3019.32,3026.64, yes so you go and lay at night and you change everyone's locks except for the people and your faction
3026.7,3036.63, and then you take over and closed doors go up and hop like messana and throw stuff down a people in the shop i don't culture changes very difficult
3037.02,3045.6, there's lots of books and consultant that offer to just this it's very very hard think about trying change the culture in your family
3046.05,3060.12, how like a was impossible right because that so deeply rooted and how people identify themselves how your man your momaya or grand you grandfather i think what i would do if i was in a culture that was committee driven or consensus driven
3060.27,3063.51, i have to ask for a project
3063.51,3068.01, be very small but as for project where i was allowed to run things differently
3069.39,3077.31, small project give me a month given these two developers we're going to run this project but i want to do an experiment on a amaurot differently
3077.31,3085.41, a report to the committee that usually have to answer to give me a month let me show you the results i'll go an do that
3085.56,3090.72, go into that and come back with results that even the committee agrees is superior
3090.72,3093.87, now have my argument for why
3093.99,3095.82, should be managed differently
3096.42,3102.48, when i offered in the talk back to one of the points that i mean i have to put myself at risk to do that
3102.96,3109.92, i am willing to manage a project in a different way and if it doesn't go well i'm going to be accountable for nothing well
3110.34,3118.35, so one has to be wanted take that kind of risk culture change will then happen because of a way how did the team scot managed how the disintegrate job
3118.74,3124.08, the report us okay now this proposal the community can look out and decide
3124.41,3128.55, the community is so you know what i want to manage my pride scott did
3128.58,3133.29, all of a sudden you have at least a small faction of people
3133.29,3137.43, in offering
3137.73,3140.58, but starts with someone being wont take a risk
3141.39,3145.5, likely to be the people in power with the status quo set up
3183.24,3186.9, we are the question
3190.65,3200.79, the question was how do how do designers recognize the badger engineers to but how did designers recognize higher levels of design and their own meaning
3201.78,3222.96, designing a team as organizational design so as to think about the different roles that it way they're going to fit together that's a kind of design it's not interaction design original notions so how does design recognize different kinds of design and not feel threatened by them i think that it all comes down to something it sounds very trivial which is trust
3223.74,3236.46, i work with you and you have a different view of the world than i do and you have different skills and i have and i see the value of them this to instinctive response as i can have is biologically i ceterae by you
3236.52,3243.57, take power away from me yoritomo because of your skills or i can feel impowered by it
3243.6,3250.74, i value you can add i couldn't it's going to make my ideas in your idea is better so the result that we produce is improved
3250.92,3254.37, the difference it flips a bit there how much do i trust you
3255.0,3263.67, i don't know you i probably don't trust you if i'd been beaten up in other organizations with people taking away authoritative a bad story on my going to trust you
3263.82,3273.48, the job then who's our boss how are they crying in environment that after our diverse skill set that could seem to threaten each other how they setting us up to feel trust instead
3274.26,3286.83, trust five other words very simple we are very bad in general and in organizations with clients at figuring out how to build trust how to protect it hooman it how to repair it very bad
3286.83,3297.36, a fundamental skill that we all should be learning but that's my answer about trust and whoever is the most senior person in the room they are the most responsibility for creating environment that trustworthy
3297.45,3305.1, i walked in the door of a project team recanted me went trust each other i look around a room and figure who is in charge this is there fault
3305.16,3307.2, because they don't trust people
3307.44,3309.21, people don't sech other
3311.55,3313.8, i for one more question
3314.1,3319.32, more hands before may be obscure the affinity
3321.78,3329.55, so what is your strategy when you are picking an idea to multiple stakeholders
3330.0,3333.15, and they themselves have
3333.21,3335.31, opposing
3336.15,3340.17, opinions you know between the stakeholders
3340.35,3346.11, so stretching a multiple stakeholders there's a whole breast of
3346.32,3352.53, a set of things i can think about the first is that momentum is powerful among groups
3352.53,3356.49, committees and so if i know this five stakeholders
3356.55,3359.97, first thing i think about who do i have the best relations with already
3360.54,3363.69, if i can if before i go
3363.93,3371.19, if i pitch you and you're my first pitch and i don't have any but i can't say that your peers are already supported me at the hardest pitch to do
3371.31,3376.17, spiced to the four other stakeholder were already on board
3376.38,3377.76, last
3378.15,3385.05, i'm not going to threaten you that way but i can come now and said i've already earned the credibility of people like you
3385.2,3389.22, behind this that changes the pitch before you can said the idea
3389.4,3404.79, think of the five who read the best report with on the start there they might not even have the most power abeles least influential but getting their by and first makes toinette second personal lot easier that's the first thing i would do the second thing is i might 
3405.06,3415.47, try to do some kind of analysis like very analytical but i would go on to three four five and go through all the criteria that they have and try to find where the overlaps
3415.62,3419.85, sweet spot that i know i think they're all going to agree on these three constraints
3419.85,3425.85, that this one's going to agree i want some analytical landscape and that may change what i do next
3426.81,3439.68, looking for a way that i can kill two birds with three birds with one stone and figure out where the that may change the idea that i pitch if i realize that they're all going to line up on this and they're not going to go for that that might even simplify my idea in a bunch of ways
3442.71,3447.15, thank you for listening and i hope you think of the danger said his say
