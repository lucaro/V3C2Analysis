326.91,345.03, and but crops you know it's raining out or if you're gettin sort of beat up with some splash crocks have a downside to them they drive quickly but there certainly get you wet red and then secondly i wanted and this isn't a pure fishing moment but i wanted a boot

405.33,412.65, the non marking soul may they all had something going on that just wasn't what i was looking for these happened to be so
412.71,429.36, to extra tough by the way for putting his foot of one of the things that i like about the way that state now it design these but the way to talk about them is their design for offshore anglers and after talbot offshore anglers bend half way
430.86,446.25, one of the ways that i think that that is true is if you're a day and your napoleon the swells you run a back and forth you know one guy hookup you on the back around the front my feeling tired you know i wear some
446.37,501.27, the boches a lot of the time because they get feathery and i'm not another for a nice you but they don't have any or support they have any feel support my feet just for fun and of the day and if your feet hurt you re going to be tired you can craniological fun these have a great nice souls on the inside really good aripo the really comfortable i put em on and i just wore in around the house last night actually they were clatchee also got this really great line of calibres cool i don't know exactly what that means but what i do know is unlike some tea pretty boots where you just got to beat swandown there after a day of fishing these really whipster way it's what they're advertised to do an i got t say topically
502.5,521.64, a couple back on these there also full rubber so within that your feet my face another habit so far yea and one can't stress enough how like they are you know when you out superior a day fishin out on a boat for the day
521.64,544.11, cortelyon sir painful at the end of the day that i have on multi task with these boots and i know that they were sure built for offshore anglers and and market is that but i had to say that these boots as i told your literate walked the beach both with and without fishing pole in hand
544.2,546.78, so a couple of miles in these boots
547.02,549.75, or no parson
550.95,567.39, don't beat your feet up support your feet like them was talking about feet stage dry ah so now yesterday i was out in the yard with him we had had a bunch of rain over the week end and and took care of some house chores in a man i know that that's not
567.45,573.78, i got him for but it turns out that they're comfortable enough that i like him for that

590.13,609.24, i would say is that come in only full size so that nine ten not not an a half i anothah it up to a system fit perfectly so i would go up not down and in a sitten oh it's just fine straight up in terms of bonwit
609.45,619.77, and like it is probably medium with on it or medium large with so works fine i actually can wear a barefoot i can wear him whether parismus
620.52,631.74, nothing about the history these boots i posted a photo to the new land on the fly in gramont you don't follow that give me a life giving you follow 
631.8,656.22, one follower of riversmouth this is handled commented that the history of these as alaskan fisherman used to wear the full twelve inch boots but they would fall the lover belaif they had to let kick them off if they fell overboard or easier to get him off or something and then overtime that rubber would just wear out and so they would cut them down to six inches
657.45,673.92, the baffalls just be six inches and statuelike flagship offering is not twelve men or up much taller a full rubber boots so as it relates to that by the way just in this is not criticism nisus only be aware
674.22,675.51, beware
676.77,693.66, six inches is great but it ought doesn't always work in a series down actually fishing the morning with these boots on both but walking in the walking on the beach ah sir casting and a couple of ways came in and every one while you forget
