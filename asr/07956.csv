0.75,35.43, some say that these are not judgments of god there is this huge argument that took place right after hurricane katrina it some say that's not god's judgment because we are living in an age of grace others say this is god's judgment but i believe that personally that god used these disasters as warnings or a time of chastening for the united states so that we can come back to repentance as in second chronicles seven i believe as if my people or called by my name
35.49,39.51, humbled themselves see my face and pretty
39.54,43.71, turn from their wicked ways than all her from heaven
43.74,90.09, and forgive their sins and feel their land to see the needs to be a time of repentance and this is the time when we are so close for to the second coming of christ where is a time of testing for christians is a time of pure fine for the believer and it is a time of warning for the unbeliever that they see these things happening that they will come to repentance and come to crisis their saviour because time is short and and the prophecy shows you the urgency of the hour in a time that we are living in he gives us these clues to know that it is near so that we act with urgency as scripture says in first caresses and every window
90.33,103.86, that when we see him we know that we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man who has this hope purified himself as he is pure so i believe this is a time of purification for the church
104.01,105.72, time is short
105.72,112.95, and god will use this time as a tremendous time of opportunity for reaching lost souls
113.19,120.3, so are we living in this time period that the bible says
120.33,124.41, happen just before christ return now
124.89,132.84, coming back to look seventeen where jesus said it will be as in the days of noah and as in the days of lot
132.93,135.57, so we have to set the stage
135.87,150.87, of this moral state of humanity jesus said in these last days there would be and all becomes man's heart will grow cold lawlessness will abound or crime will abound
151.11,172.5, and in second second timothy chapter three of evil menace dussala worse and worse so all of this state of fornication adultery the pornography that's in the world today all the crime and drugs the is the stage where is being set
172.62,181.11, now all of the signs the would be not only sociological signs a technological science geological science
182.79,207.69, whether signs and all of these different signs would take place to tell you that we are living in these last days so is there enough evidence now when christ came the first time they were prophecies they related to his first coming and said the desseins who the messiou be and so the people could recognize
207.72,209.64, first coming of christ
209.94,217.95, the god wanted us to recognize christ second coming and that's why he gave us all of these prophetic scriptures
217.98,221.88, recognize that it is near and how we can then
222.03,225.27, laperouse for christ return
225.54,228.03, now 
230.1,233.34, earthquake at the crucifixion
233.73,241.8, there was a big earthquake there was a big earthquake at the resurrection there was a big earthquake when paul and silas were in prison
241.86,243.72, who can that earthquake
244.86,282.3, had to be got right after the rapture admit point at his coming again the scriptures tell us that there would be great earthquakes in sectry eight a pastor always shares the easy to thirty eight possibly that easy athirt eight will be before the rapture or after the routeing of the tribulation but in the end of it he searight it describes a great earthquake of the second coming when christ comes and hits the monopolies with his feet to the great earth quake with the monopoly was split from east and west
282.81,298.2, causing the earthquake as jesus described in le twenty one mark thirteen and matthew twenty four there'll be earthquakes in loose gospel is a great earthquake in various places whose causing the earthquakes
298.29,304.11, it has to be got as the time of warning a time of chastening for this generation
309.96,322.92, the united states is in serious serious trouble not only financially but the state of this moral decay in the truth project
323.04,330.3, that speaker i can't remember his name of ann but he said america is indeed deep trouble
330.33,335.73, and as i shared with you a lot o time america is absent from bible poesy
335.88,384.39, i don't want to like unpatriotic born here in hawaii and my parents were born here in hawaii and i love this country but we have to be realistic about the state of america's of moral situation and we have chosen a leader were a lot of christians have voted for this later who believes that evolution is compatible with christianity he supports this abortion and the homosexual agenda i believe personally that this oficial crisis will get worse i spoke of thee the study last week saying how much worse it's going to get possibly next year
384.57,390.63, and but i think it's again it's the time and opportunity of evangelism
390.87,398.55, so in matthew twenty four in a examined some of the 
398.58,424.56, the evidence is this week focus more on new testament prophecies regarding to the second coming of christ next week i'm going to share more in the old testament prophecies and then untersee i'm going to share of how his should then live somebody the false religions the false teachings the cats the apostasy as happening to day as they said in the last days and second feenished two
424.83,438.96, the apostasy will come what is apostasy with some scholars say they say they think i caught a cold the rapture i and other scholars the apostasy is a falling away from the faith
439.29,456.06, and believe it or not i read this one study it came from a baptist survey that said that eighty eight percent of christian young people aged sixteen to age twenty six i believe eighteen are falling away from christ
456.3,473.4, and it astounded me but when i looked at a lot of my i have two daughters one is twenty three the other is twenty six but from their teenage years to know a lot of them have fallen away from the loaning go to church
473.64,478.29, some are are living in sin others are 
478.41,489.69, some are pastors daughters that are fallen away and is a real sad state but and that's why i believe that prophecy is so important because
489.72,503.61, we have that more sure word of prophecy that we do well to take heed and i think that if we understand the times that we are living in we should live more
503.61,518.49, earnest expectation of of the more inclose obedience and abiding in christ so much more than at any other time in it in history because satting against the body of believers
518.55,533.43, he's attacking the body and i believe not every time i give a mansion prophecy something something goes wrong and a lot of times it's the technology or whatever
533.58,542.79, but it never fails in in virtual countries like in china and indonesia with is a lot of persecution
544.41,555.48, people that are beaten and tortured and thrown into prison believe it or not are the pastors who teach em bible prophecy because it gives their congregation a hope
555.75,561.15, and those tastes do not preach in a second coming of christ
561.48,564.36, bother them the churches are not torched
564.48,576.18, pastors that that really preached the whole bible from genesis to revelation and give them the hope of his second coming those are the ones who really get persecuted
576.57,585.3, and so are we or are we not living in this last as in matthew twenty four
585.3,588.24, in turn with me there mate twenty four
