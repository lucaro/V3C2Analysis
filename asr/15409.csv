9.06,11.43, a recent
12.81,17.01, some animating the somali
17.1,23.85, i sometimes ponder some one like
31.53,37.92, these ominous
38.04,42.93, some some some chance as mooseheart
45.51,47.22, and what about
47.52,49.41, some people might say
52.47,55.35, she
55.5,57.81, interesting as
59.37,64.35, one story was ossossane
64.59,68.1, that he wants to get rid of 
68.76,72.09, always i always was a born
72.51,73.77, for women
74.28,75.93, i was born in a
83.4,89.37, morsinia
90.54,92.1, he
92.43,93.57, really
100.17,101.94, is the
102.69,106.05, assiduities worried about it
106.83,110.58, assessment for
112.98,123.72, i have believed that this is a view that i also was eenamost in the second row a real view and i sort of kind of brought attention away
126.33,129.69, if you think that tenterden
133.14,134.76, how important
135.42,137.61, seems to leave to
137.94,142.32, sort of like awful consequences i mean from a feminine
142.32,144.12, generosity
152.58,154.29, a
154.68,155.73, and
158.4,162.36, as his part of my gains a woman to
165.78,167.94, i really startling
167.94,170.31, exasperating
171.75,177.48, at the sight of footsoreness
177.63,182.28, he stated this is part of hard of my candidature
182.28,184.23, all his awful
185.64,188.07, the increase to
188.64,193.53, now in society as it is built into my prayers
193.53,195.06, i really
196.59,197.7, from
199.26,204.9, no holiness and this contrast of yes
205.11,206.58, inculcated
207.48,213.06, how indomitably often that harmful stop seems
213.39,215.4, at
215.82,218.49, he 
218.79,221.22, imagine
221.34,237.96, it is well excoriation
238.2,242.79, the tension save half a poseuse
243.18,250.62, i alone
250.71,254.67, natural
255.3,258.0, i
258.33,263.04, malise
266.43,267.96, you have
275.31,281.97, resolutions
289.83,295.26, eleseus distinction of geoffrey
296.22,299.73, says we have generosity
302.16,308.07, generation upon general restaking upon so
311.43,314.91, generating up on
315.99,317.16, gender
317.16,318.21, say
318.87,321.33, that's a problem
322.5,330.93, you say well aimee it does now but that's only because of a society of because hesitates all his
331.11,332.88, i curst
332.97,334.8, but
334.95,339.87, what's going on is that maybe the missionaries is a misnomer
341.1,343.65, talk about sex body
345.3,355.17, i i don't see for
355.26,359.37, now we say that the person always knew that they were really no
360.15,362.22, the obvious that they were really female
363.21,367.23, and otaheitan up
367.89,369.81, the last
371.64,375.69, an artifact of the society of the living now but from
375.72,378.21, plainly see if you
378.27,382.83, as it works tremble away all the tender from the sacks
383.97,392.31, and when by as the starving or madmen that at all disturbing from a domestic to say that a person had this kind of identity
395.97,397.29, and
400.08,401.52, not look
401.91,403.62, by the way
403.65,408.18, and i agree with her missus bullivant's wise i think
408.42,412.11, we should as she also thinks that secessia constructed
413.04,414.57, he doesn't think that
415.08,419.73, things that even though his sex generation is a distinction between us at work
421.47,423.18, six bodies
423.69,427.47, the boeotians ructions ructions different
428.25,431.28, i rather
431.58,433.32, but there
434.52,437.04, the person of better
438.24,440.91, i made with you raises his
441.12,444.39, you notice
444.51,448.41, typical behavior by corbitant a gender identity
448.41,451.29, miscegenation
451.65,456.15, using the onregenerate suffered flow
456.63,463.74, a sinister industrially going on in the case of like internality
468.69,472.2, and she tries to bates
472.44,475.59, her amethyst reasons for eating
476.64,481.2, meehan with us just as different vanities
481.59,485.43, let's just forget the appeal to
485.49,487.98, material cartesian go
490.53,493.83, the only adoption she considers 
493.89,496.68, in rather
496.83,502.53, and because we defined sex in terms of
502.59,507.06, the yanert in right of forthrightly
509.19,510.96, see to make sense
513.12,517.32, the only other way make them oranges to say
517.44,522.63, maybe look at worms that like tends to be a difference in terms of like
522.81,524.58, a female brains
526.86,529.11, it didn't seem possible
529.35,535.53, as angeleide is in the different brains with one different behaviour
536.85,542.61, where she sustained
542.67,548.61, rotherham easy character still vary so much that their own way
548.94,550.29, one
550.41,555.63, i want to see me there's no way of making a perfect 
556.11,559.47, too much of a testator
560.61,563.25, i have opposed what i think some 
564.09,567.57, sir the misamis
568.23,572.43, the wayside which is
580.44,582.3, bosforo
584.31,587.97, filling a comfortable one body as is
588.81,591.12, having an internal body image
592.2,598.14, this is the way the riteway then passing
598.68,602.61, i eternal
604.41,608.4, an internal body if it
608.46,612.0, travoises itself in fell folliot
613.71,616.14, you have turnus
616.2,618.99, antonio
620.55,626.01, mal but there was an elite that and to have your visually
626.55,627.84, how this
629.19,632.1, were something like iron money right
633.18,635.37, you have an internal body image
635.52,637.05, conflict with
637.08,640.47, in confital representation of it
645.0,647.82, and both and reminded
648.96,653.16, appeal to 
655.95,658.92, anne
660.45,662.79, this phone
662.79,669.12, having so like arm is still part of our volume agitating it's there you know it's not there
670.08,671.88, also
678.33,680.76, oh utensia
681.96,688.29, i hate to the watercourse office it of fountain
689.7,690.69, you
690.69,692.55, don't recognize
693.12,695.16, a part of your body
697.8,701.91, so you might try to come up with me to eternal fount
702.21,704.46, that says
704.58,707.22, not recognizing certain body parts
709.2,712.8, and our feeling is that other one part do belong to you
713.13,717.84, and then a confectioner visual representation of 
717.87,720.81, i swear by
722.13,724.5, this is what we mean by
726.48,730.89, in a last this phenomenon of a conflict between
732.09,734.25, one of the missiles
734.55,738.45, i say nothing this is right she goose
738.54,740.34, just unlike
740.43,745.74, give her over money lionesses point
749.55,751.38, poised
752.1,754.26, maybe this is like a nation
759.39,764.94, the responsibility nearest blushed that we can't
765.15,771.12, constitutional as this could be i could see this as being part of
772.44,778.59, for disorders in the dead well as 
778.74,784.05, the somewhere along with the other personal identity just
784.17,790.56, songbird that that may be for mining on a scouting
791.79,795.69, just trying to repetition tonnelle crazy is
797.1,801.39, he did robertson
801.51,803.37, scindia
804.21,808.23, i now got out he
808.71,810.84, an eternal
814.38,816.99, so
817.5,820.47, i am is
822.0,826.65, prisoner
834.66,838.74, turn all intravisceral 
840.09,842.88, materialise
854.43,860.79, no i says so seasoned to all they actually set bottle does work
862.44,863.64, cause
863.82,870.09, the charlatan is not a line with the external body
870.3,874.98, and so you have fancied
875.16,880.32, i misrepresented
884.55,888.42, complexity rising out with
888.96,891.33, indeed change
894.84,898.32, over yet there perfectly fine we
900.93,904.35, a woman like
908.64,913.17, seems you have distinctions about what you think fit with 
913.2,915.45, see
916.56,917.88, i mean
918.12,920.07, i will with
920.16,921.93, the actual sex
921.96,929.88, in batouch in case of yettocome visiting your back some kind of mask
929.97,931.41, in
931.47,934.23, it is the fashion
936.27,947.1, i remember just as anticipating right and endicott point
947.25,950.01, i think that we negotiate
950.28,953.19, i think i essoyouti
954.27,956.91, bring it this way pettiness
956.91,960.48, was that wrong enow
961.47,966.6, what kind of subsumption is you can have like
966.75,968.1, on
968.37,972.84, everything the whole colony that whatever
972.96,978.15, you can have any you can have when you do you 
978.63,979.89, do
979.89,983.25, balsora
983.52,984.96, different
985.56,986.82, different people
987.12,991.92, the degree to experience holstering were experienced
993.39,996.36, some uncomfortable with
996.48,998.01, i rose
998.1,1000.65, i owe
1003.05,1006.68, in what other people call it may be to them that something else
1007.55,1010.94, that was so many cases of like falling to more
1011.06,1012.47, he 
1012.71,1017.48, i my point though one of the reasons is a way which
1018.53,1024.77, and to disagree with all my try to press my tried to resurrect the second option
1025.58,1027.59, ay that was
1028.07,1029.78, palatable
1031.16,1032.75, i have
1032.87,1033.92, saying
1039.29,1044.51, the same sensitive
1044.93,1047.45, enchanteresse
1047.9,1051.08, either virginia
1056.99,1060.47, this narrowed with the timepiece
1063.5,1065.12, the
1069.23,1071.51, irritating 
1071.84,1075.38, that was a drawn to some
1075.62,1078.62, the one thing that she's been saying is that
1078.86,1084.83, opening this the eternal bodaciously leaned through some kind of interpretation
1085.76,1087.65, a kind of interpretation
1089.69,1098.15, even evabody
1098.69,1099.83, cultural
1100.64,1103.19, an all an active part 
1106.31,1108.83, individual sort of interpreting it way
1117.89,1123.5, the people about this choice being alvedero
1123.95,1126.95, i think that you would say that the right
1129.83,1130.7, but
1135.11,1136.58, even if she did
1141.35,1145.82, she did it would still he would still have
1148.07,1151.43, internal sex bodies even if it was culture and mediated
1152.06,1153.98, interpretation for
1154.67,1156.23, a part
1157.07,1159.98, still have this 
1160.97,1162.59, really
1164.9,1168.38, part of the issue that she's in a worry about is how cultural is this
1169.49,1171.71, culturally saturated is this
1172.76,1175.67, is it to what reason contained
1177.14,1178.46, i think that
1179.63,1181.88, i do this and he did
1181.88,1184.73, the case initiated
1185.54,1187.88, i but
1189.35,1193.01, my friend take this here are now here
1193.52,1197.81, and take a stab at warburton
1201.95,1206.54, even though in the main and like a lot of what she says i think you know that
1206.75,1209.06, it sort of writing
1209.51,1212.87, what contrast between
1227.9,1230.0, only this boy
1236.09,1238.34, letters
1239.06,1245.48, the little poniarding
1249.35,1255.17, i disbelieve and be like changing aspiration
1255.98,1259.76, i think the one i have economising aspiration
1260.0,1261.74, his boy
1263.45,1264.77, get
1264.86,1268.28, richard will resist
1269.87,1270.68, but
1272.03,1276.32, it let me give you an example is
1277.22,1279.89, example of the
1280.28,1282.47, the person who chooses to go to a
1282.8,1285.53, i have the light like changing aspiration
1286.94,1291.38, the isolation that line changing aspiration
1291.92,1293.69, as of the fact
1295.1,1299.96, really sucked for them when they were in the eradication
1300.83,1302.93, it was bad
1303.71,1308.48, hairlessness or no connected to
1309.95,1317.21, if that when time and it was on the basis of that that they formed the licensing as aspiration
1318.62,1322.76, in attrition has an ended sight you will be a total
1327.56,1333.14, but the sheer unpleasantness of sort of like you know proceeded life
1333.17,1338.39, have estiano be aspirational at all in active able
1339.02,1348.02, but i may have an aspiration or if you do have a operation can be a different kind of operation could be enough oration to get your neck it
1349.7,1354.95, what operation you have writing on top of the negative sort of experience
1355.28,1356.18, and
1356.33,1357.32, with
1358.1,1360.14, just is that
1361.19,1368.15, napoleon anyway it seems that we might win capture the ocean of folly dispose
1368.18,1372.98, that seems like a convenience some ways independent of a life changing aspiration
1373.31,1377.39, you can build like not comfortable at parting your body
1377.48,1378.35, but
1378.41,1383.18, not for a leaning aspiration were not made an end
1384.86,1386.54, you may say well
1387.77,1392.36, my life what eblouissante 
1392.54,1395.6, going this and when i dislike
1395.96,1400.55, i say i don't aspiration for like
1400.79,1403.25, thus surgery i mean
1403.28,1407.57, you might find out you might not in some way how ministration
1408.2,1409.52, be like
1409.94,1411.29, i like
1411.41,1413.36, god and my body
1413.54,1415.43, oration on about
1419.27,1422.15, so so infinite
1422.48,1425.54, i say that at least in some cases
1427.4,1431.39, around issues of life you know chanot
1431.51,1433.73, the self assertion
1433.73,1436.91, i think they're going to want to know willis
1438.59,1442.85, not necessarily a similar table into the model of announce oration
1443.63,1447.74, prior to and motivation with regard to an aspiration
1450.32,1454.28, and on the face of it it does seem to relate this
1456.62,1459.41, internal distress external
1459.8,1461.87, things that she wanted to get away from
1464.33,1469.46, she would get away from it retribution across the board
1469.58,1472.19, just enumeration to
1472.25,1479.54, so far with aspiration to do something else right to become a loss of earthen
1480.47,1484.01, the weddin but if there's something else going on
1484.61,1488.87, this something else is precisely at this kind of conflict between
1489.11,1490.82, all internal
1491.51,1495.08, regardless of whether not its natively builders
1497.3,1498.74, means that
1500.3,1503.81, something has been olifaunt is not why
1505.55,1509.57, it doesn't quite work for me because i make sense you guys i mean
1509.93,1513.83, and i say i think that the ship from that is alienated
1513.95,1516.08, identity
1519.2,1521.96, i think that the importance of
1522.71,1526.43, we and the choices were made on the basis
1529.1,1530.9, the important to
1532.04,1534.14, candelas part
1534.44,1540.44, erinaceus ion on reality and sexual affectional radiation
1541.07,1546.05, in the same thing right you can have a
1548.27,1550.49, life aspiration
1551.51,1553.88, marry another woman
1555.11,1559.37, i can be a basilivitch ning aspiration to me
1560.42,1561.74, however
1562.46,1565.4, i may write over top of
1568.16,1571.25, rotation tacitean
1574.91,1578.96, that's not necessarily the same thing i don't think
1584.03,1596.18, oration to miss and it i'm gridiron to try to sinister to forster
1600.68,1605.3, actually come on agin were about langannerie
1607.4,1616.43, alimentation i don't think that it's easy i mean i think that sort of a way you think about it is almost a kind of narrative activity where
1616.46,1619.94, understand you consciously loveland
1619.94,1631.07, talks about understanding something as a sensual desire right widened the narrative of interpretation to make sense of it as such
1635.75,1639.35, i do think that there exist
1643.37,1645.14, action 
1646.28,1647.87, attractions
1648.68,1650.15, i heard to
1650.63,1655.07, independently of any kind of cautious interpretation of narrative
1657.2,1661.37, as a soothing themselves
1663.08,1665.57, doesn't it with her sense
1665.6,1671.24, so even though they have the desires the popping of the interior
1672.29,1677.66, white integrated into the narrative of themselves they have quite fifty interpretation
1677.72,1679.43, but then to
1680.12,1683.6, nation he made some time that person
1683.6,1689.57, right on our sometimes not but costly pushing it away from the interpretation
1690.14,1691.73, not integrated 
1694.37,1701.57, maybe they have that you can have it badly is fortis not
1702.11,1706.07, then upon kind of narrative how quite understand
1706.91,1709.28, no part of a conscious
1709.28,1710.75, station
1711.5,1713.36, perhaps to the profit
1717.02,1726.68, only you're not going to get the aspiration right the light changing in aspiration in less is informed by a narrative
1726.68,1727.76, the
1727.82,1730.7, i have the aspiration of
1732.8,1742.58, a woman by this part of equitation standing in a particular way is part of a large picture of the world that i have as part of my interpretation
1743.15,1747.23, i saw i had the aspiration of getting off
1747.47,1754.4, jaging to that laceration desired by conscious picture i have
1756.59,1760.67, when it seems to me the body is botanist
1761.0,1764.72, independently of any kind of conscious narrative
1765.05,1769.34, there are prior to any kind of consciously
1769.37,1770.72, taken up
1772.64,1774.41, rations
1774.41,1780.83, in saying that i say that i don't also men to say that there are quite not culturally mediated
1780.98,1786.02, culturally interpret i think that i think that i could be still culturally mediated
1786.17,1792.86, i had to fight it is it's not is not working and kind of life is conscious narrative kind of way
1793.04,1795.05, blair
1796.31,1798.23, prefigure out
1798.77,1801.44, if i mathias
1801.65,1803.21, saturated
1807.17,1811.04, resistance
1811.07,1812.45, trouble
1814.07,1816.2, the
1816.23,1818.66, so
1819.98,1825.26, think of themselves as astarte
1826.88,1828.41, the rest
1828.62,1831.65, sister people 
1835.82,1837.38, and then there's
1842.75,1844.88, not able to see something
1845.93,1848.54, sobbed it and
1849.62,1853.37, this pointer with a vise
1853.49,1854.81, the
1857.09,1861.17, i really mean together these two points are really
1861.41,1862.64, at
1866.21,1870.26, how far you want is complete outer holymead
1870.71,1875.72, i tell the story as i depend on hotel the story of others for 
1877.1,1881.03, rubinstein terms of fantasia
1881.39,1884.33, not going to believe in terms of body in
1886.31,1891.74, by the way i'm inclined to tell the story we probably have a little bit of legation
1893.66,1896.15, i think that the
1898.19,1899.39, this way
