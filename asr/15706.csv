0.06,25.56, this is annie fox family confidential secrets of success parentine my guest today is diana babel diana is the co author of the fatherless daughter project she's a successful life coach motivation speaker a writer a medical expert pieces and the founder of the fatherless
25.77,28.2, welcome to family confidential
28.38,47.58, in any way i'm doing pretty well to day thanks i was just drawn into the title of your book the father daughter project because i am a foreigner and i've never really read a book on the subject and i wanted to ask you how you got into it
47.88,66.66, god first of all the father was daughter by jack welcome to the tribe anybody his fatherless miasma father when i was thirteen tragically but i lost him first at three years old to divorce and then again at thirteen when he died and believe it or not
66.69,69.96, the way home from the funeral had
70.05,105.09, i felt what was god's baking to me and i was pleading with him about i can't believe this is happening and now you know my dad's gone i'm thirteen years old at this point out really no clue no concept as to what it really happened to me but i was pleading with him in the vaccinations core and i felt like he spoke very clearly to me and told me that there would be there's a reason for this and that i would use my boys i did really understand it and i didn't go back to that story for a good twenty years a basically forgot about it
106.08,121.44, when did this resign this idea too as you have created a community of father the daughters to this project and give voice to a lot of women who i'm guessing like myself and my you got a buried this loss for a long time
121.65,182.73, ah what fatherless daughters normally do is the pain of losing their father to to go underground and it doesn't reserve until the fear of heaven so what we really want to do in the book of what was most important for me was to go back to bellomont where you were when you lost your father because a lot of people don't come to terms with it till their in their twenty thirty forty awaited some people in their adiante understand you know where it started they say in three or as to or fourteen what are they really do do you emotionally spiritually physically and we pick up the pieces from there and then take you through the journey because fatherless says is a journey it's not something that you're supposed to get over it something that we keep fairly silent in this society for some crazy reason and i really would a blow the roof and talk about it because it's not the brush to be embarrassed about
182.91,191.31, really interesting i'm wondering in your experience is a different you have lost a mother at an early age
191.4,241.95, i think it is you know a good friend of mine hope elman wrote the book mother was daughter and that was my goat to book and college a kid i couldn't find a book like you said this spoke to just pacifically fatherless daughters i got a lot o there be through her words but i still felt that there was a community that was missing a started basically researching asthronomy childhood any time i met some one who was fatherless i take little copies nobilitates at a dinner party and i would be in the corner talking to him in low and the hole they would lose her father so i didn't want aquitaine and quantitative resort the ears and when i found out was that when you lose your mother the community rallies around you and really
241.95,266.16, and support because it's not very well heard of for a mother to abandon and be for a mother to walkway you know single handedly walk away from something your doing so what i want to do is get the book the father was sartaroe and talks pacifically to girls who lose their father because one in three women do in a big percentage abandonment
266.46,272.1, and they feel low they don't feel like they have a home and so that's what we want to create
272.31,276.96, it was interesting how you delineated in the book about the different ways
276.99,278.55, you can lose
278.94,296.97, father you know you went everywhere from death which was the experience that i had to divorce to a father being there but mostly not available to incarceration to substance abuse it was quite fascinating
297.18,314.16, you while we did that it's so interesting that these girls including myself including you have this pain they carry it round with them but they feel like their pains different than every other person's pain like no but this happened no it was twelve or no he did this way or i want her it
314.4,341.67, and really it's parallel everybody feels the same way you just get there at a different a different way but i thought it was important to talk about percentages and each way you become fatherless so that because there are some difference statistics between death and divorce or where the way we put it as abandonment and death the girls who lose their father to death like you and i tend to have a more positive
342.0,345.03, i sat around their father 
345.36,382.95, sometimes make him a little holier than now or unlike the king because he never lie even if he was terrible in his lifetime we can fantasize about it and we tiptoed a father was daughter who was deserted and articulation abandonment they tend to be the ones that statistically compete the back rather little more hypersensible more taking trollopes ality in it comes out an unfortunate ways because down deep their dust religin
383.76,392.49, i'm thinking about my viewers and listeners who tend to be parents of tens and tens and
392.97,400.44, they might be listening to this and hearing oh well my daughter that i'm raising
400.44,419.64, doesn't have a dad in her life or they may be taking it in personally from their own experience and saying wow denis speaking to me and i've never explored this so i'm curious for your perspective how does the fatherless daughter then
419.97,426.48, she hasn't doubt with the loss in a therapeutic way how does that affect the way she parents her daughter
427.08,442.26, so interesting question if cyclical unfortunately we found over and over again that a father a daughter was raised by father was daughter and the cyclones because
442.29,571.23, what they find a mother is raising a motherless daughter a lot o time demeter might have made poor decisions in her life you know if there's divorce or deserve senor whatever and she wants to be done with that father you know so she may alienate the situation and therefore show her daughter of that you don't need a man you can do this on your own and the woman or the daughter then takes on a lot of male energy and so society sees her as bitherstone tation when she bent her whole life learning how to take up herself but to get into the real world and belittle out of control or you will too much for me where is it afther died and the mother is you know mourning him then that girl may take on the dull responsibility with her mother you know let me take care of her let me not bring up his name let me not show her in looking at his picture on miss him because after me on her side or had to take care of her so i think the hard part of this whole thing of might so important to get the hellenist you can't break it by yourself i mean i want to round with the heaviest load you can possibly imagine that out you know a personality outwardly looked happy and on paper check check at check i was doing everything you needed to do in society and you know i would like i was doing a great job you know i had the husband the children but down deep i was just lost and really sad because i lost the connection and i'll tell yo doin the work even though it was put upon you and you feel like a i want to do his work do in the work and going back and find in the forgiveness to yourself into the others around you may be in the peripheral part of the family really does hear you you can heal very late life you can heal when you're eighty or when you're twenty and in between tom just makes like little bumper when you could be having a really good time here
572.31,586.98, that's wanting that i really appreciate about to book is that it wasn't just describing this stuff that i really felt like a work book and some some level that you could work through a lot of the stuff just with the information in the book
587.49,677.61, yeah what i wanted to do and you know obviously a wilkottle a bible in a antidote feel like or some sort of work book i did this book years ago called interceptor book that was phenomenal and i feel like this is not something a girl once to walk around and say so she could put the book on her night stand and start doing the work you know at night and in her own home in the privacy of her home and work through it we also interviewed a bunch of men and the book the gods that love is the husband the father and said you know what can that husband or father or porter do to show her that they're not going to eat get revenita a lot of work for a man to take on in my husband's done a critical with that but it's really important to hear from this man and no that we have a little cry that was put there were heart broken but we can be held and fixed up very nicely with true love and would some one that we now support size and better yet understand us and really respects where we've come from where we want to go wonderful so you call it a project so doing project in that this is an ongoing project for the people who are experiencing and working through the assorting
678.15,752.61, oh it's a project because this is a life long journey it's going to end in flow as you do as you become a mother as you become the same age he was when he laughed or when he passed away and all these milestones in your life happen and you mature you see things very differently and you have to go back to the god book and say okay what do i do here what everybody feeling at this point in her life there's a lot that happens as you move through your journey the other parafin the project again this is not just a book for me this is a lifelong mission so when i'm eighty five i'll still be talking about it i promise you i want to write down doctoring mentorship program we get girls all over the world literally saying how can we help how can we get involved so there's a mentorship program it's a little bit like a book club if you will and then you learn if you are one you can mentor one god is got the gaslit you go to diana balcom you can find everything you ever want to know about how to get better and her other stories from other fatherless daughters and what i would like to do
752.61,768.72, at one point we're going to set up the website so if you click on anywhere in the country you can find another fatherless daughter another group that you can connect with a love that idea that so great because a lot of of carrington as it's very isolating
769.26,775.5, and that's the whole mark of above was daughter not you know they don't get mad they get distant
775.59,782.04, and the reason for that is we are really scared that if we speak our truth
782.07,787.8, someone might leave us and so we go to every
787.92,796.77, you can imagine where really we're just selecting pain on our self again because we don't want to say hey i didn't really appreciate that because we 
796.89,815.85, in the not knowing if this be in two geringer needy or a man being two controlling like where is where to a naturally fall and it takes a man to cut as you want to use that energy and went not to mother as well but it takes two for a reason
816.42,830.46, it also is the thing you know gateships where there are two women and one of them is a fatherless daughter the other is not and so that supporting come from any intimate partner
830.73,889.92, it came and we talked a lot about that now alone in my community that are insane sex partnership and i think it's just important to understand the need of two parents a call at the father was daughter project because that town affected me but it's just the need of having two people they are showing you there's not just one person was world that may or may not be there for me as if one can leave will the other and where your learning you know your brain don't really completely form to your twenty five you're a lot of self as you develop your brain change in your hormones or spirituality or physicality and their so many things that you need to have different perspective on so the more people that you can have whether it's a standin father a girl friend an uncle or whoever you know it takes a village though the more we have the better the more people we have the better and the more honest wearable as you say speaking of truth the more likely we're going to get the help we need
890.04,901.59, absolutely i love it think it's so much in and this has been great no i'm i've got about thirty seconds left and i would love for you to once again tell a viewer in lister's where they can find out more about the work that you do
