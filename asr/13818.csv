134.25,145.14, mattiotti her heights are at will over an out and so are you going to fly into victory this temper at an forsake landing sir
145.38,160.98, you two silly question number one but when you call outside minutes oh i don't have my doctor and glasses the prince spoke did you call from a florida number before the lion faced at where compotator ida right
161.1,163.02, and now you're on a new york number
163.29,170.31, that's right now i'm calling from the studio line this is the rector radio for flash
170.52,182.37, and the other thing you said that you know since i got on a ticket to another ballot i have earned myself a place with fournier view with our organization
182.43,190.38, and the reason that kind of musing is that in illinois the green party is not an established party throughout the state
190.38,193.77, is established in the congressional district
193.95,195.84, you know how many signatures
195.93,202.71, people leave to get on the ball of your inner third party guy and how many dethroned noon
203.01,231.57, forsake weltering in illinois in or a democrat or republican unique somewhere between a four hundred and six hundred if you're an independent or a third party in somewhere between a thousand and eleven thousand ballisters from a four room treatise twenty thousand signatures
231.69,242.31, in the district where i ran because the green party is an a stablished party so i needed well signatures
242.49,257.16, while alice at my drink out there that unbelievable i can't believe that is true that one half on percentum of u uh oportet te ye
257.25,286.65, trial standard got in last election i think it was like twenty four hundred and ten tower and establish party in the fittest as we got more than five per cent of the boat a anthonio of the greetings of the fifteenth five cent about this time we need one half of one per cent of what the governor candidate got which was twenty four hundred most by that big capital one per cent to get well
286.65,291.81, well that louis worse than gerrymandering district or something like that but
291.81,310.71, let's get to the core the issues you know i'm sure you have a platform you know issues that you're running on and that's what like to hear first what are your main like if you had to create a platform to please share with the audience here your platform sir your most important issues
311.55,358.83, i have a platform with your welcome to read an observant of our better i am come here or my top free issue issue number one is to stop america from becoming a socialist country there are a lot of former burning supporters and actually quite a few people in the green party of an american soloist country of socialism is the worst economic system the possibly have and advertising your party as being a socialist party political suicide so my number one god is the top america from becoming a socialist country
358.89,363.27, over to secular government for all
363.33,483.39, going to sponson that remove god from the money were going to remove god from the bunghole chance because the federal government has long made it clear that we can no longer tolerate being in this country so why is a betterment sponsoring anti atheist bully it's time for the government to stop being a theist and while we're at the secular government brain going to sponsor legislation that are legislation to eliminate christian federal holiday and you might think how outrageous how are you going to get elected to intensest a lot of christians and actually face sofort the idea because i have sold the idea to them they want to put christ back in the trespassers religious is the government is involved in the government involved in scotland to treason government out of the christmas business we can restore christmas and return christmas to the christians so they can make it a religious holiday for them instead of the national inhalations electoral reform i want to medicaments so you don't end up with the kind of gerrymandering that you have here in illinois in selinunte states i want the legislative districts to compassion i was consolation to require that all andiatarocte or required to get the tanner of nominating petition signatures instead of one relatively low number for democrats and republicans and an unattainable high number for independence of third part those are my captress
483.57,491.79, and that sounds like you know something that build a consent in what support in the lection day holiday
493.2,547.08, no i don't think it's necessary any more and let me work with ingomar government i'm going to eliminate the national day of prayer to ferrarese but as far as a federal holiday now it's definitely not needed because most people nowadays do early voting so other people who vote on election day are just the left overs and haven't gotten around to doing early voting so we certainly don't mean a holiday on election day and one other gatherer one reason the best reason to do early voting i never again have to vote in that church because my local precinct boilin the church i know highpoint this of all time will we do do early voting devoted the township office for village balloonatics is a sitting
547.65,557.82, absolutely right i don't see why more people don't you know male in the ballot the head of time and you know say themselves sometime and energy etcetera now
557.85,561.57, how long have you been in the district that you've been in and 
561.99,565.68, long have you been in district number five 
566.01,638.46, i now live and work in the area all of my life all sixty three years of my life i do to gerrymandering extreme permanent in illinois my home was a sincere public office before the chairman of the enemy democratic party who wrote the publicist as it ran a little narrow strip a mile wide and ten miles long from another faraway district and then made a right turn a ninety degree turn to the right and another strip of bottom mile wide and four miles one to grab my house and put it out for away district nobody knows me and i don't know anybody to us constitution protects congressional candidate from that type of a scanty recurring stem by saying that potentate a resident of the state in which they're running but you know to be a resident of the district postponement to the fifth district even though my house is slightly outside publicistic the gerrymandering
638.67,654.42, now that's true and now as you and i don't have this particular question but let me sure a lot of people would want to know why did you decide to run as a green party candidate instead of you know the republican or democrat
654.51,711.72, i'm a retired radio not so ten years ago i had the green party candidate for governor in the tenor or as a guest in my morning drive rigoureuse after raising to them that i was in the wrong party when i was in the democratic party what i really should do is become part of the green party so i've been with greeting party for ten years i was the chairman of the cooperate chicago's biggest city in coconino been with the preparation years that's imbittered party agree party is a environmentally sensitive we don't take corporate contributions to our constituency is the voters not the corporations to date the thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy your influence
711.99,724.83, no light now rob if you don't mind i wouldn't mind going down like the list i have about ten questions here or ten issues just like to hear your thoughts on each one here if that's all right
724.95,742.41, it start with accountability and transparency what thoughts come to your minds when her accountability transparently there should be maxonville and maxim transparency i could elaborate but i think that makes the point real clue
742.44,746.37, right great and the next one is the justice system
747.27,849.84, our court system is a house of brought the facts the law and the constitution don't make one i owed a different in court what matters is are you friends with the judge is your antony and even more important is your attorney a friend with the judge orthoptera france with the judgment what is the political persuasion of a judge because the judge is there a pensioner to dispense justice the judges there to advance his personal political agenda so undemonstrated by what happened to miriam unawares supreme court nomination america were unliterary down the black maelstrom the same culture as american from the same general community as he probably the most highly qualified nominee for the supreme court of all time he can't even get a hearing because of the republican party has made it clear that there is not only the triton priority when it comes to who should be a judge is politics so in politics is the only priority of the rupee court and the lower federal courts and state or two for that matter they have her credibility nobody should take seriously anything that our fort saying to it's all based on politics and who and that whether i or attorney or the opposing attorney transmitted
850.32,866.76, all right and the next topic we like to hear some of your thoughts on a small admit side businesses i own a small business i haven't airplane instruction does i find it airplane ily builders as center for dollars or if airplane
866.76,870.09, so well these are two seats
870.09,901.53, that in all the country there you know not like wilmarths are real airplanes of people flying airplanes like the one that i fly in all over the country i help people build airplanes and so i'm a great and a osma business and also medium sized businesses at ayscough you know that's why i am opposed to socialism with socialism it will melanotis getting it right
901.56,914.1, what mattered with socialism is whether a try and if he tried to get faith if you fail to get at so there's no incentive to making sure that you get it right
914.19,917.01, eliot perrault
917.04,925.08, socialism you get paid so i capital informal business and politics as well as large but
925.59,936.84, like you probably would have been against the ballots and right and so now next topic is that military spending and foreign policy
938.82,943.53, you ask me about military spending because i have long felt
943.71,952.86, that is a a for our forces to intervene in the calf of other countries
953.22,963.3, the other countries ought to be saying which other countries ought to be paying the salaries of our soldiers and think the operating expenses
963.33,991.29, our recitation an intervention in the half of their country and set up our tattersett getting stuff with bill for subsidizing the familiar support or for other countries and alike in germany and south korea and lots of other places saudi arabia so what about the other trade
992.4,999.45, i know what the questions i mean to hear you worried thought on a free and fair trade with other countries
999.78,1001.88, here's what i think we ought to do
1002.09,1006.89, i think we ought to and this is relevant to your question
1007.22,1015.11, what we need to do in this country is eliminate the income tax of ten anyplace at
1015.14,1017.45, a consumption that
1017.66,1022.79, because that way we would eliminate the explorer
1022.91,1025.91, instead of
1025.97,1051.26, oh products coming in from other countries where they have of a lower tax rate of the postproduction is lower weened to lower the cost production here at home by eliminating the ethelberta the intermean that would the similarly by putting to pensions act that would place a higher tax on imports
1051.26,1080.87, so we could do a lot for the belgrade deficit we could do a lot for exports and look country and we could do a lot too while minimized import nothing important a bad thing but customer or level playing field if we were to eliminate the income tax which only affects protruded in this country and that you o consumption as so no matter where the products are produced pieces
1081.29,1089.48, all right all right great and how about just in general civil liberties civil rights
1090.98,1167.24, the most prominent chest of the history of illinois i have the slogan erotomaniacs fighting in justice one victory to time i have won more state church separation battle in this country than that i just not anybody else in the history of american maybe more than a help them a history of american beetaloo state church separation violations in illinois and i have successfully challenged but i've also been involved in challenging other injustices openers ago when i ran for state representative in illinois i had a europa for a euphemia heathens family halitherses family love heard of the defence of marriage at wareborough winganameo i was proposing a defense of family at which to the any
1167.24,1169.31, married adult
1169.37,1177.17, marry any other willing unmarried interrelated adult because that's your family
1177.26,1217.88, so i have been a long proponent in analostan to both elisaveta in the supreme court from from about a year ago a any detestably the national policy now my proposal from ten years ago is the sole policy i fall so i bought in justice in regard to a hilchester minorities from what i had women too for what i found is that most minority groups women lacapelle they want their own people fighting their battle they don't want rosamond it so i support but i am a strong supporter and advocate
1217.91,1222.08, and activist for social justice and civil right
1222.26,1254.27, right here let me just ask one more question on that in a different age here what about privacy versus security that the bat identifies all right and i don't want the government spying on me or spying on other people or by claiming a we're doing it for security because the then opens the door for the government the planetary spying that it does pinical opponent or were doing it for security reasons right
1254.27,1264.2, but we need to get rid of the same by politicians to spy on their opponents a biplane were doing a particularly
1264.53,1272.54, all right sir and those the major favorite past or present people elected or not and why
1275.3,1278.78, the elected people past fortress
1279.32,1289.13, right out there are a lot of them but i suppose my favorites would be all of the democratic president and none of the republicans
1289.49,1298.58, and now how about a pitch to you know because the democrats and the republicans and the independent
1298.94,1306.53, our district what would be the pitch to the people on the opposite tastes that you're running to represent sir

1374.24,1407.0, you want is the best source so i tokening if he sometimes into suggest there the best newspaper that's like people should read paper but similarly bottome because i'm the best tandakora look at rochemaure if you support my agenda you should vote for me and maybe i won't but even if i don't find perceiving a lot of boats i can then go to whoever is that does it

1449.27,1457.82, the burden of this national sales tax where people would get like the voucher or something you know what i mean by that
1459.2,1464.87, i i have a general idea to her let me answer your question in this way

1494.12,1552.35, a selection is that of all was not just morbidness people fall bushwoman money we spend half our lives training track of a hat or cap pliability is and the other half for a olive trying to figure out how to well find ways to evade and details instead of wasting all that time and all that money on account of you comes but uttered by the cayadutta time trying to figure out what is the legitimate amount that we oleaginous uncreased in value
1552.35,1557.57, you know what we get rid of all the games and all the tricks and all the deduction
