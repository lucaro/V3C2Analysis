4.35,6.24, i have a challenge for you
7.2,9.21, show you three images
12.21,17.43, i want you to tell me if you do know what the speed limit actually is
17.91,20.31, heaven look at the road
20.46,23.73, that you with a director of the department of transport
23.76,27.93, plenty think you would apply to it so what spademen
27.99,35.13, apply the pedantically is safehaven at first street have all got that straight
35.52,37.89, and then the place actions
38.25,42.3, the capes if you just can't yell me what speed you think
42.48,46.56, to apply as a speed limit to this particular road
47.07,51.15, another road or a mass at speed into you think
51.21,52.56, to apply
52.65,54.42, this particular road
54.72,56.34, number of actions
57.51,59.07, the environment
61.02,68.61, fairly open road again the speed of at the youth in surely that that particular road
69.69,75.51, to introduce my next speaker which as doctor bruce can he is from a monastery
75.72,78.42, and he will run through a fourth with force
78.69,87.39, said limits are all wise safe spots and i'm sure they are because intelligent and articulate memories what speed limits ought to be
87.42,93.75, clearly the other side quite irrespective of the nature of the conditions in the nature of the road
94.02,99.03, some of the photographs were saw before the bright and see how you went
100.8,108.96, what sort of elements do we say in this photograph was broke that might help us understand what the speed ought to be
109.74,112.38, we look at this road saying here we see
112.41,115.47, for example right side poles which are
115.59,117.18, forgiving
117.18,124.83, ride side trees as well think that would be one of the common concerns in that setting i think we know that
124.89,135.06, as with good safety features collisions at about fifty combers prout is about the maximum impact food that you would want for that type of crash
135.18,138.33, it sitting also andrea where we're lucky to see
140.34,151.71, a guy we know in terms of the boracic limits of humans to impact forces that thirty callers proud is about the maximum speed
151.83,156.45, that you would want to avoid a particularly severe or vital acome
156.48,159.51, repent their second response
160.17,162.81, most people think it should be a year think
164.46,167.97, in the same sort of issues is there it 
168.03,172.53, tenths to work to collide with roadside objects
172.56,175.5, we all think i guess that we're going to stay on the paved
175.56,183.03, one of them my dealings i guess you know strides people actually sting on the pipe and and not finding themselves as
183.06,188.19, in collisions with rods i donegan collision i have about
188.28,209.01, cairo to to produce britisher very severe atoms if it happens to be a saint which she quoted happens between a card a ritidian thirty corners brow is about the maximum that your vehicle can withstand before the risk of a severe at come statewide rapidly
209.43,212.34, if we moved on to the slighter open road why
212.67,230.28, ave got to fail even spread in the middle age with a few drifting off to the it cost top in this i'm just thinking that's probably about lacetania and and but what we draw from this place 
230.43,235.5, the major issues there in cities a water ride listen
235.5,238.11, deception if
238.5,243.78, but with the literation right there and then in the sort of the mid range of the
243.78,245.49, the photograph and
245.64,261.0, thinking about the biochemical limits of humans in crashes collisions of about fifty columbus paris about the level that you don't want to exceed and in no circumstances something like one out of ten
262.11,264.9, struck vehicles will be a risk of 
264.9,266.25, it
266.31,281.58, come brow we started to get a very rapid rise in the risk of a severe uncannier the right hand side of the picture who looks like a bachelder so have you done some analysis of these sorts of fur pedestrian collisions
282.15,283.8, we have an
284.13,289.53, the carlyles were now in
290.1,293.43, large parts of our country that we
293.73,322.56, older pedestrians are very much represented in the fight of comes and we either as people are the functional popperlace declines they not as agile the fast in terms of crossing wide roads and not think we need to start looking at the effect on our adoption of the future as well so have we looked at a distinctly and missed him perhaps in some way to have a grantha sort of thing you ever annoy i think if we can bring up a shop there
326.01,328.98, simple trend trend in parisian its
329.04,334.26, annotator all the wife fruiterer
334.32,335.52, year
335.61,338.76, the one distinct
338.97,341.52, i guess we're in the noisy
341.52,347.19, something around one fifty or so but his death every year
347.28,349.05, no no
349.08,354.21, to a new level below one hundred and probably averaging around
354.24,356.79, anatapein
356.88,358.47, the only
358.98,365.88, explanation for that was the speakers were introduced to victoria on a large scale in nineteen ninety
366.12,374.82, we see another step dropped down and again there happens to coincide and that goes through a level of a round
374.82,380.88, or more facilities as to a new level at ranges between fourteen sixty
380.91,387.93, that hasn't got anybody and a gattonside with a major new speed and italy with
387.93,416.49, equipment tied to tolerance by police and a host of other aspects facing one on speed recipe had the opportunity to have a look of things like the effect for example that enforcement might have all the effect that some of that weariness and education might have as opposed to some of the other factors which we limit the ostentat we travel it have had the opportunity and over the last sort of five or six years i guess
416.67,427.95, the thing worked with the monsters of men doing a lot of strategy development work to help agencies and decision makes all round the country too is to me what sort of reductions
427.98,431.82, severe trauma that is defense ious injuries
431.82,439.77, possible from investing in a whole range of redimisti then explode i guess as annotation
439.8,443.97, kinds of benefits on the vertical axis you see there
444.21,447.45, the reductions i retain a period
447.51,449.82, in serious injuries from
449.88,453.84, the case of ichang programs the blue bag
453.9,458.97, in the case of cape of vehicle initiatives trying to get accelerate the take up of
458.97,466.38, prudent safety features into the vehicle fleet are the yellow bar investing in rodin for structure the red barn
466.47,481.77, when we start to look at stepping up the effectiveness of the enforcement of existing speed limits the purple baerensee and increasing result there and if we actually look at what might be possible from lowering speed limits
481.8,489.57, but comes progress the network he can see the sort of reductions that we get and we actually look at that is
489.57,493.83, estimates and start to think about how much it costs
493.83,507.0, delivery of them we find that reductions in statements will by politically difficult and certainly comfortable can be done at absolute fraction of the cost of of the alternatives
507.0,514.02, about infrastructure investment which also delivers well but his extraordinary costly to acute
515.52,518.82, open to some questions from the floor
519.24,529.35, when i went to the road safety once when i was learning to draw back and pack senate certainly three or four remember correctly
529.56,531.42, there was an emphasis on
531.63,537.24, drawing a passengers as sin
537.57,546.0, experiment was done to draw the length of port ride at what was in it miles in a sad beatitude sixty
546.39,565.47, and are going to mars and now where i could say getting what one fireside and apparently the difference in holding was only two minutes i don't think i've seen emphasis in right side which emphasizes that gotama first doesn't get you there
565.47,569.01, much quicker i was wondering whether more emphasis should be put on that
570.03,574.35, we've done some research in back about a decade
574.44,591.06, i was considering whether or not it would go from the cumbrous the falernian of fifty which as we all now now has been diminished direct evidence to measure the changes in trouble time and simulation methods were used
591.09,594.96, the impact of going from sixty to fifty
594.99,597.93, to be something like a non second
597.93,600.33, in your every divan journey
600.6,613.5, as a result of that lowest level and the mist of the trephine in people's travel times is about congestion about traffic signals delaroo sorts of alencon a loveless of at
614.88,616.98, we have another question at the top
618.39,624.3, previous graft shadrach's the reduction in victorian fatalities from pedestrians
624.42,631.74, how domestic reduction in those fatalities in about nineteen ninety after the introduction of the steamers
631.83,635.82, i didn't see a very dramatic reduction in
636.15,644.58, solutions in about when a boat the national ensphered from so 
644.73,650.73, reduction there i think that percent also in man that will put upright there
651.57,665.16, the biggest guy i guess kindly notecase space were so much higher in the network of that time so think it makes sense to expect that with enforcement that you had substantial 
665.34,666.63, in the
668.76,672.15, i think i was reduced in two thousand
672.45,685.98, no i think some states actually begun soon or the man so we do see again a sort of mark drop for round two thousand one two thousand two handouts antically lower level from
686.04,688.89, about it down to something
688.98,691.23, that time around or so
692.04,696.06, expected the reduction would have been a right as right in the second opportunity
697.35,699.45, and we have another question to one at the front
701.31,703.65, i was wondering why
703.71,706.5, we don't have
706.53,724.35, i wrote only have one speak limit regardless of the conditions are just think i driven in france where the odor roots have speed limits of a hundred and twenty normally but clearly indicated if it's raining the speed limit is ninety
724.44,726.84, strictly enforced
727.2,729.96, because the conditions are different
729.96,742.11, no we don't have as much renascence but it would seem to me that it is not unreasonable to have different speed limits according to the conditions
743.7,753.18, we don't do that as you say i think there's a strong scientific argument i guess for sight because if you got back to the
753.18,755.61, calculations at reparabit
755.61,762.51, stopping distances and we start to put in a different level of friction riconciles
762.51,764.49, it is compared to 
764.52,767.34, in my taanach
767.43,770.28, vision that is reduced because of
770.34,774.3, that the very conditions et cetera that i think there's a strong
774.3,777.24, for something lower but
777.27,781.17, i wonder was brahaspati split
781.47,791.16, to have some variable signs on the south eastern freeway as you descend from the allied hills down onto the plants but think that's about the only place we have them then we have another question somewhere else
791.28,793.02, the face
793.65,798.12, satiated whether there was any most work with
798.21,813.24, and effects around carson because they quite powerful now boys and i'm just you know something simple that was about increasing the pressure you have to pay for and you celebrate you hit the speed limit for
813.45,814.95, what is
814.95,819.51, so that is a prompt a little bit different to a speed all those who are 
819.57,822.72, control because if you're actually
823.26,826.08, the road is not necessarily
826.29,829.47, watching his speed a hundred percent of the time but just
829.86,833.7, some way that both cars actually working with you than
833.76,836.64, i had to stick to the pavement
837.0,843.72, there is certainly some technology that's going around for some years now let's plan trial as pendril
843.72,846.6, in europe which is intelligent speedest
846.72,848.58, a number of
848.64,852.78, happening around the country to try and get that sort of technology
852.81,856.32, more and more vehicles intercepted
856.35,857.7, that
858.15,871.53, in which speeding as low as the day amass a benet up to date and then you do get prompted if you ever are but the speed on it for her to versions and buy a couple of columbus brown you get a prompted
877.29,886.26, advanced forms you'll get up with pressure on the accelerator that might a very difficult for you to continue to drive about the stove
886.26,894.69, possible emergency situation of rivetting it uncomfortable to keep working against their precious
894.69,899.19, this sort of technologies will continue to 
900.15,903.0, for the people system of the sea
903.39,910.62, i thank you but can
