61.32,71.76, the past couple of weeks we came down to thailand we've been working with help save the kids in notre
72.39,74.37, and i just
74.7,78.66, to be a blessing to them and i went to guatemala
79.2,80.67, with the same group
81.03,83.31, church at least and it was awesome
83.52,86.61, two weeks i've been entailed
87.03,90.12, and working with help save the kids
90.36,95.1, there to help take photos and take some footage
95.34,100.2, they could have some advertising photos for what they're doing there
100.44,106.86, on this specific trip the lot just look like building relationship with the kids and with diane and judah and just
107.04,111.57, really growing close to them and just laughing and having fun in being free
113.25,134.73, sanitation in two to r i a mother and son team and have created a family unit and people are welcomed in and they say treat their kids asteroids and move
135.78,140.31, seven years ago and another there are
141.78,155.67, they have a hall have haunted generate ministry from little things titanotheres awesome its
155.85,157.26, a gentle
157.41,164.76, a really nice really sweet or therewithin
166.92,169.56, as on the china
169.98,171.96, and patch
173.76,181.77, i think adamantine just like
183.09,191.43, to everyone you know she is great and it was late in the day and the sun was going down
191.46,198.24, then they are we began not tell me me alone norman he was feeling hungry
198.3,203.49, she just so kind and so sweet and loving and just
203.82,207.12, the example of i think how we should love people
208.38,210.03, a fine
210.27,213.66, he is unlike any one i've ever met
214.44,216.09, get things done
216.57,224.1, a very interesting way but everything is accomplished the originally from australia by
224.22,233.04, the opportunity while i was in school to travel throughout thailand on tiptoe classmates as about the thing
233.16,250.08, and yeah i went back and he finished up school and went on to business and trade and the i decided that i would do it all and had to thailand and at the time i thought i discovered something that's kind of challenging to myself in different than the norm and see what i can
250.56,274.17, do for people in that year and in the first nine months i was really just rocked by what is possible for a person to do and decided that this was saint wanted to carry my life too but it aethere in tinware on the tie them aboard
274.23,284.79, there with the idea of education for grandchildren from them was a sure how that was gone but i had met from people
284.94,323.55, quite a few years before that and had relationships all up and down the border and so came back to see what i could do the thing that was in my heart or whitetail education were able to with agreement from leadership on both sides were able to bring children across them further the education here to goodman be canaanites the yells now did aniething that when they come to very serious
324.09,329.37, one of the first line were very obedient unusually obedient kids
329.55,359.25, also very serious said never had toys really to play with as children they had had that kind of educational development that we just take for granted in the west we give children toys from when their born they had not had that kind of education the education system in burmese rote learning and so they had not had created education to think in that that much broadway into reason it was not a part of the education system
359.25,361.56, so that really was
362.07,365.79, the biggest change that's taken place as we have
366.06,372.21, with the kids and i think that that by living with them that emerson into the english language
372.48,398.31, so they learn english really quickly because every day we went to every day we speak with them they also learn tie and scorn and behaving most of them have if not more but they learn language quick the close day or interact with the different languages and soon any one day or hear them will hear different languages in the house as they speak to one another
398.52,407.4, we are the kids are come here are from the poor caring from them
407.58,421.47, after really four years of education that children are really expected to begin to work and they work in the fields to parents work in the fields extremely the kind of most of them would expect that that would be their life
421.95,426.78, we're not going out i will be watching the
426.78,429.69, and have my
430.2,437.07, radnor have any dream away a predicating laid
437.37,449.55, they come from a rural background but also life is difficult from when they are very young age they got responsibilities of home of pitanate
449.85,453.87, no running water in their homes is now electricity in their homes
455.46,469.98, because of the year war that then had been an inside that kind of hardness and difficulty of life many no tragedy loss of family members
470.16,474.39, and the poverty of going hungry
475.44,481.08, and i think that for a child that is so important especially a child that has come from
481.2,491.64, trusting civil war that they come from a place where their families are broken the family be hurting their parents have been hurt and so they become herders and it's this
491.82,497.34, snowball effect i think within family that there is not
497.52,499.53, is not freedom shed
501.54,513.87, for i've had a visiting came the last two weeks so things haven't been at the usual lusiadas schooling plus sports and really lots of other activities
513.87,527.07, with the team here were fairly flexible because we are a small staff and have sixty eight kids and so where i will too disconsolate school work and do something else instead and
527.13,601.44, and that's what we've done on a number of days with this visiting team from calgary ahneota was screwed on took a great nooks where like playing different games the kids were playing the game where you just throw the dark and like the blunt in a prize and every kid on my team one of priority spoke to at that allotting architectural and really enjoyed that had a lot of fun the other part was painted a mural
601.53,630.45, and love and they help to crime the wall and to the full as gottesdienst
632.67,642.15, i think the favorite theme that we did publishers
642.15,660.78, dying far across the maintenance wainamoinen the ataman in at the beehive
660.84,668.7, school away from their families so pretty sweet when they get to go home and see their family as because they inconsolate
669.54,672.27, really good because
672.39,677.7, go together to the kids has and pray and
677.91,679.65, it is with
680.01,684.03, and the kids who very courage corentin
685.32,686.88, really as
686.88,691.38, and it's in a case with a tin
692.04,693.93, what it together
694.68,701.46, the trip to the kid's holmes was amazing and every house went into the
701.55,709.95, wanted to feed us they wanted to give us something and that was really cool their families were really sweet they were really happy to see their family as i could tell
709.95,726.06, the families just welcome the same with open arms and fell as and give a string and all that sort mecontente just so annette that was really awesome the thing that we did in the afternoon was to play for formeth against the
726.12,730.41, hospital staff and that was a return match
730.62,748.38, bates by one goal in the first game that we played montessori and so we wanted this return match togeather is so passionate about it and the girls have changed for them and the boys just
749.01,759.75, running so hard playing against kids that are probably twice their age it may be twice their size you fools also i know there are the kids are also passionate about football
759.87,767.82, so it was three together perform and just have a blast and the really good they're playing against people who are a bit older than them
768.15,772.74, the first had to we were the one but
772.8,780.75, the second half he also to astakeelee just one one with no wish
781.05,782.91, and being an draw
783.0,788.64, definitely really proud of how well they played in their passion out there and they worked really hard so
788.67,789.63, the
789.69,800.7, like i was a great game though a great match and just it was just fun to just fine while we revere god time hesitative good game
800.88,802.23, tell
802.32,804.36, the composition but we
804.42,806.82, i and the said
807.15,808.32, he
808.95,822.72, yes they were to play with our age so we have been another match in the near and hopefully that looking haulin
823.98,838.17, teetotally have a pre school a kindergarten in that area
838.5,850.62, and so we went belisante first time really that i have spent any length of time with the children since the school began in june
850.62,861.09, it's not so not possible to go very often if reprimand with my head these kids would be left by themselves for the day
861.15,864.87, parents were just have to take their isolated
865.56,867.36, be responsible for
867.57,870.48, and 
870.51,873.96, perhaps at the same there would be looking after another baby
874.62,876.18, parents would be away
876.63,900.03, i school we go see the kid and talk with the men share story with them singsonged
900.87,912.72, the teeth
912.87,924.09, it was really sweet because it was like the next generation of the crankiest our kids were teaching their destroying them some songs and
924.27,938.46, games and the little priesthood kids did their song and i just really adorable cooeperate all know that they were just
938.88,947.19, sort of giving back to where they came from and encouraging the next generation of kids that are coming up
949.56,965.97, no five years ago and fifty is committed when the camp sites stand like a roll and notice because a steinthal
965.97,985.32, there said mister alder i think no absinthe anything for they became you know and they will very quiet down very shy thou withdrawn as serious as we expected they would be and when a good supper these
985.32,994.77, to you no miyanoshita when even to you contacted and did not touch
994.86,998.52, no very serious like 
998.73,1009.86, something very heavy and very scary testifieth what temper with me why we have with me and
1011.27,1013.37, this day later
1013.37,1015.11, a few weeks
1015.32,1028.55, we try to let and keep their like a very closely there was truculent within two weeks to change lay
1028.94,1072.35, they knew that there were some were so different and that was what was amazing to them they would look around and wait for punishment or there would look around and expect that there would be in trouble or where they'd been you know the illustrations in the stentorian whine of our staff he just began to speak about how much god loved him how he knew that he was so loved it was very very powerful and it when he finished i i really thought i needed to offer to these children and i anisado
1072.53,1081.62, he was to have what days got in his life and they just rushed forward to sit at my feet
1082.07,1090.8, and it was really also there wasn't one that sat back it was a rush to come forward they knew that heard something
1091.25,1092.66, different
1092.81,1097.97, i knew that had something they had never heard before a love that had never
1098.03,1108.83, come in contact with and it deadly impacted them and they came forward and we just prayed for them and they were never the same again
1109.19,1120.65, it was like this gigantic leap forward for them because the things of the past began to fall away from them and they knew that they had a new future
1122.27,1143.39, down in fathomable that were here to love one another that is not just something that you can hear the cache i honestly in the core of my valancourt my being after having little julia with foolish for my men in australia and coming out and realizing that there is
1143.45,1155.84, different levels of giving of yourself and there's the point where you give all of you until there is nothing left in you realize that that is where a conditional love is met and there is just terenate
1155.96,1158.87, the important thing for a child is to feel love
1161.09,1167.15, that love will say that child grow to be someone in his confidence in some one that is
1167.48,1218.0, significant in this someone that will will base somebody someone that will say challenges in imagining drama all these things are created out of being in a situation of love and for i really do believe it the core of it all that we as a people are to love one another on conditionally that there are people out there waiting to be loved to a waiting to feel the complete acceptance of what it means in in the relationships you know in many of the hinstant the parents been tremendous amount of bright down and even parents suicide since we've had children here in a really really traumatic things because life is so difficult may do not have hope now these kids they have hope we languedocian
1218.75,1220.55, is a lot of love here
1221.06,1221.96, and
1222.53,1232.76, i think that's made a tremendous difference to them they just begin to really understand what joy is in the have joyed nods to play to be kids to be care free
1233.21,1237.14, as christians we can hope for the impossible
1237.38,1247.61, can believe and dream for great things and we've a really encouraged a kids to train and to hope for a future that's very very different
1247.85,1413.03, aneantissement aeternitate aeternitatis
