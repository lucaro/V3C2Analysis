37.74,40.62, it is fiction based on facts
41.31,42.36, fiction
42.54,44.25, based on facts
44.61,49.02, imagine a very cold night on the sidewalks of man without shoes
49.2,61.14, so a good samaritan assessed the situation this seemingly homeless man could use some socks and boots and the samaritan does what any good samaritan would do
61.62,64.92, in socks and shoes
65.4,68.31, expensive new shoes and socks
68.61,73.68, see this gesture and a plate good samaritan and that his good
73.83,76.44, the symphony enough kindness in the world

95.61,97.17, in his world
97.17,101.49, such a beautiful pair of boots would have been an invitation to murder
102.03,104.58, he could have been killed for those boats
105.15,106.35, by the way
106.74,109.38, not homeless he has an apartment
110.61,117.87, difficult to resist judging others besides it does feel good to think of oneself being better and another
118.41,127.14, i try not to judge it more or to judge what i am seeing things are not always what they see which does not mean that i have become cynical
127.32,128.91, he calls

145.5,148.8, i like mercy be assimilative
149.01,150.42, it
151.29,158.88, whispered into your breath how could god do this to a child on it to find that the deformity was not an act of god
159.21,161.67, a deliberate act of a mother
162.09,166.35, so knowing that a deformed child who gave more sympathy
166.95,168.75, more money
169.89,173.88, if i were to ask i would ask what kind of a world is this
174.24,175.92, would make a mother
