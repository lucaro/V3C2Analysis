0.09,44.79, hi this is eager from each had not come i have recently re discovered my love for avidius three d d e and although its slightly outdated is still capable of producing interesting looks in this autorial i created something that you would typically use made program like light without mama any program like that to create a three dimensional logo in a metal plate remarkable thing about this effect is that it is one per cent produced using native tests without a single third party plugging and this includes stones everything you see in this piece can be created using abides person seven point six possibly even older stunned the latest is and i say everything except for the audio so let's look at what i'm talking about
44.85,47.37, he
51.6,56.19, look at the pieces and here we have a metal plate with a bumpy texture and a reflection in it
56.37,60.51, reflection moving we have to lay beans etching the loo
61.02,64.68, little glow and blur where the pit the metal surface
64.89,79.83, we also have smoke rising from the surface we are not going to build its effect from scratch because it would take too much time for the tutorial but what we're going to do instead is the settite over here and see how each one the pieces works
79.83,94.44, treat me some complicated at first but when we start breaking it into individual pieces you will get a preceding of it let's look at the first thing which is the solid color that gives the base for a metal then we have the noise the gives metal its little bumps
94.44,96.3, through the war of course
97.11,98.91, and we have
99.66,104.13, text that has a hole in the middle all these pieces combined
104.13,105.63, give us this
106.38,124.74, next thing up we have a couple of red later lines and practise when we combine these two we get this survey interrupted laser eliminating particles in the air and with a little bit of optical glow because see how the glow is dense with the red color is stronger
125.25,129.45, the blow off and on of an
130.2,133.98, when lars combined with the metal we get that
134.52,139.74, and then we add a little bit of low and blur where the laser hits the metal
143.73,150.9, then we have three tractor noise generators when combined those three look like that
153.9,156.39, we shape those up into
157.26,162.0, a little puff of smoke and when that's combined with our peace
164.52,166.2, we get the final product
166.74,174.21, not tapped into each one of these notes to see what's going on in actually i'm not going to disturb the overall tree i will just create
174.27,192.06, offshoots let's load three teevan were going to feed the metal color into the important the metal collar was just a solid color that we saw earlier will step inside the three by double quicking first thing we do is we select the layer which is our purple background licensure property editor
192.42,194.79, enable lighting for the surface
194.97,197.88, now if i wrote at the camera
198.51,200.01, can see
200.31,212.34, that it's a treat mention object that's lit by a single life that's the default light in the scene next thing over the surface is property editor will be on environment and pick sat in a state ottocar
212.52,215.37, you could see that it's reflecting
215.52,221.7, one of these built in environments reflection maps and you can choose their bunch of different ones
222.3,227.07, you can even feed you on if you add another imputed
229.23,232.74, thing we're going to do is we're going to add the graphic
234.81,236.25, delia
237.06,240.39, kestrike get back out
240.84,246.54, let three television the keyboard to add another input at connect graphics into
248.61,261.18, go back to treat if you uncle ab slayers the dev connected to impart which we don't really need you can select it and deleted by present lead of the keyboard where we do need is
261.27,267.15, selectively purple middle plate and good property editor and under this placement texture
267.15,268.8, select into
269.1,271.95, so now what's going on is recreating
272.22,280.98, the placement with those three restricts recreated the graphic displacement looks really rough but we can fix it first thing we'll do is
281.07,288.39, place of the doctor the crease softness to one hand increased detail to ten and ten
289.38,311.67, now you see it much more defined brooke and this restores projecting out of the background and we can change at spiering the black and white values of the image that were feeding inside so so everything it's white will pop out there in its black stays back and the amount of extrusion is determined by the scale factor so put this to point twenty five see
311.76,316.05, tiny little bump coming out of the projecting towards us
316.17,326.37, change the direction of the extrusion by either inverting these black and white values in the graphic or for a quick fix we can just go to negative precept
326.4,336.15, in here and as you can see now the whole is being edged inside of the surface as he saw earlier or metal plate also had little bumps and hears a noise
336.42,338.34, and if you feel
338.55,362.16, the noise instead of odes rostocker nicosia has his bumper and if i disabled the blur that we get a lot sharper surface so that's why i keep the blue to round off the bumps now the problem is if there's only one in put the goes into this displacement maps are choices to either feed the bumps or the log but how do we do both well let's see
362.43,378.9, here in the original effect the thing for the log is composite over the noisy background a little hard a seat but they see these parchment like white noise behind the black log and if i take the output of this composite
378.96,394.14, faded into impersonated and some that you can see a fine little bump texture along with the etching of the log the amount of bumps is determined by the amount of mix of the noise in this composite so if i add more
394.26,403.83, see how its surface is getting bump here now it's pretty bumpy that much as we can go in this case without changing levels in the noise itself go inside a thread brought the our camera
407.67,411.15, confect of the bumps along with the local
414.27,420.18, is the handwriting effect i will add another graphic present double pace
420.3,435.33, pace or fine logan the several different ways you can create the handwriting one of them is to paint over the letters with a brush the kind of cover the letters but not too thick and i will do that in the order in which i would write this so will start here
439.53,441.75, do
443.1,443.97, the
444.42,449.31, you can see i have several new free hand strokes out here i will select them all
449.94,451.89, go to objects
452.22,457.38, handwriting let's turn off to bounding boxes i can see it better as i change 
458.64,470.43, out of heads and tails i can make this thing right now you see that each one of the strokes he starting at the same time and to overcome that i'll go back to gothic objects
470.61,472.26, in strokes
472.5,473.73, now
474.36,484.38, writing from a top and you can imagine how how you can use this to mask the war of course you would have to do this backwards you don't have to write it backwards you could just animate it backwards
485.58,489.51, let's see how the leaders are created will add another graphics
492.57,498.48, the line too it's go with the tin line maybe five damarus self his profile to
498.63,505.65, how partisans as far as the masks let's paint on red and alpine red channel and alpha
505.68,511.35, here is a line it stretches across a screen just a simple red line with a corresponding alpaca
511.38,512.55, back out
513.45,549.03, the fact aloysius coen piece this one here the gods to have a good ratio of black and white areas so where we have black the laswell be invisible and instead of fishing for the other piece of sintimint multiple select a composite and optical glow capitol sea and patiently and will feed the fact of loisette bottom and the graphic and the top and as you can see now our line has loiterin in it if you need to eat a sickness of the laser go back to the graphic and khrushchev
549.09,567.45, bothers you later now the optical glow and a nice soft glow to the laser and if you look at the elfish nel you'll see that there's a ochanee out with it so i will compose whatever we fetter so let's try to combine our pieces together will do a little bit clean up a menomonee tree appear
567.9,571.8, move the town here this is an old graphic sing we no longer need
571.86,574.74, i'm going to steal this composite
575.52,576.66, the
578.31,590.34, going to the bottom and up to a glow to gournay can see a layer over the metal plate let's quickly animates the strokes so select antistrophe objects
590.52,609.12, by stroke go back to objects in writing and with the combined to selected lilliesford which has created an animated and writing stroke over the entire length of the object which is for seconds and that we need me to make this pastoral do is make sure the object select a good to the animation editors select all the channels
609.42,615.27, make it nears the speed is caused him and i'm going to retire and by moving the last key from towards the beginning
615.3,621.3, now we have a more reasonable speed of writing that's another to animate the laser will look on the graphic
621.93,629.61, said the graphic you see the red line over black you don't see entire composite in order to do that we're going to step out
630.75,636.63, connect the appetite composites to the alternate step back into the graphic
636.81,637.8, and
638.04,648.06, select connect your top time line and not cause both elements in context and to animate delays or now simply enable automatic key framing down with the 
648.81,651.42, and just step through your peace
652.44,653.58, moving
655.2,658.32, wherever the stroke goes
659.94,661.53, the idea
662.01,679.5, i will make a little bower and glow wherever the lads are his to meddle will copy and pace the existing burned low it is his to graphic effect and placed between our composite append the bulletins as you can see the already two little dots
679.53,684.72, existing effect it will make our own place of little circular breaststroke
685.23,686.22, selected
686.52,694.92, come and change it to stack effect and inside the stack effect will add a couple of dodging breezes
696.75,699.57, one of them will set for mid towns
700.83,702.15, one of them
702.6,703.98, light
704.28,707.85, experiment with these whatever works for you
707.85,711.03, close two boxes and a blur
713.55,714.96, that the amount of her
717.6,728.13, papa i'll make roller little wider is to smudge in a majestic way and then on top of this but adds color blind just to give it a little bit of a tent
728.46,734.31, that to whatever color works faith if i step through the effect a conceited existing
735.09,750.06, saronia ed but they also changed sides in a pasty which he can easily animate sefele one of these existing ones you can see over here you are pasty graft the thing is changing capacity to give it a ingesting look so that's it for her and lo
750.3,789.63, meaning thing is the smoke effect and if you look at one of the oldest trials cold fog and smoke noticed that this whole section over here to left was actually lifted from that tutorial except for the foreman spoke shape and some other to get in a great moneta how this is created you should you should watch the partin spoke to trial but basically say that the three faces generators that generates the different levels and frequencies of the smoke just to give it a more a feeling of a volume than their war operators and two of these to give it a more turbulent felscombe altes here and you can see how
789.78,801.0, the moving in more than just one direction giving it more of a natural organic feeling of a smoke and for this purpose we also added this map smoke shape which is basically a match shape that animated
801.9,809.7, nothing elaborate or realistic either but it works pretty well it allows the smoke to start off his small dark and then expand
809.79,811.86, see what he looks like a real time
814.26,851.73, the beginning of the trial i mentioned that even the sound is made within the to see how that stone was like one of these tartrate of them one for the left channel and for the right channel this one is simply a animantia expressions may be to meet expressions parts to or something like that you will see how he can use expressions to create sounds have at the
851.82,853.65, it oratorial
854.1,856.26, you can also go to
856.26,865.74, he had not come on down this whole present to see how it works it's a good thing actually you can plug it in and start changing values iagoo way to learn
