0.06,14.37, this is annie fox family confidential secrets of success of charity my guest to day is dated jennifer freed
14.46,20.13, jennifer is the co founder and director of the highly successful ten program called a half
20.58,27.18, harmony and achievement which serves more than five thousand families annually in the state of california
27.33,35.37, he's positive attitudes social harmony and bridges the achievement gap i jennifer welcome family confidential
35.49,63.42, i am so happy to be here oh i'm excited that you hear too now i talk to you about building the piece in this world because my goodness we certainly could use more of that and i understand that you've got a program for tens that allows you to tap into what i would consider the most idealistic selves because they are young people are idealistic and they want to do the right thing so tell me how do you help teens become peace builders
63.99,177.66, we decided some years ago that the best way to improve the climate of schools and communities was to empower teenagers than selves to be the leaders of climate and community and we beloved a training that's about ten hours long that we take teams into a room with a bunch of motivated and highly skilled adults and we teach them how to leave their own connection circles how to intervene in bullington with humor and curiosity instead of more hate we teach them how to welcome marginalis people at school and make them feel welcome and inclusive and we also show them that much more ventages to be taking great care of ourselves and bringing that in the world instead of trying to enforce or change other people well you just given me like so much to respond i think my first questions going to be how did you get into this particular work in your your therapist i have a pain psychology in a train mediation maccari and i've been working with teenagers for over thirty years and an the co executive director of a hand we found it a hot nineteen ninety nine after the columbine massacre because we believed as educators and therapists that there should be no teenager that ever feel that much hatred toward others or self hatred that would consider that kind of harm mobsmen in the part of what you do in your skill building peacefuller workshop training is to help kids recognize martialis amongst them and to reach out to them cantilivre
178.05,180.0, we help them
180.3,198.06, learn the most basic social an emotional skills and two of the hallmarks of great social and emotional skills are emotion management and empathy and so we talk to them about what it's like when they have felt left out
198.06,210.78, they have felt alone and there doesn't seem to be anybody there for them so first we go into their own experience and due connection circles around that topic can tell about connections or close would satan
210.81,236.61, simply a circle of two up to twenty where one persons the facilitators they use a talkin pesume only speak when you have the talking piece other than that your respectfully listening the talking piece facilitators starts the circle with an open and question to really get at the heart of the matter so a question might be
236.73,268.2, when is a time you have felt left out and what did that actually feel like to you and with facilitators begins by being open and vulnerable and as answering that question and then passes the talking piece and usually asserts one or two or three questions and it takes twenty minutes to an hour so okay just to define terms our listeners and fewer talking peace can be any physical object that the facilitated in his or her hand and when
268.83,278.1, the speaker has this object in his or her hand no one ask us to interrupt were all charged with listening a hundred per cent
278.16,282.0, and so you don't have to worry that someone's going to interrupt you is that correct
282.78,326.43, so correct and what we found over years and years of doing connections circles with teams leaving them is that even a d h d diagnosed teams censitaires for an hour and listen very attentively when it is a element and emotionally important subject so what we found is that tenlow to listen well when they know it's important to them you know the two things you are not here you you don't have to look for opportunity to jump in as so many of us do i i've got something to say and interrupt but the other part of his you can kind of relax into what you're speaking about if you're the speaker because you don't have to worry about having to fend off interruptions
326.88,358.35, not only that the shyest of speakers don't have to talk we tell them to hold the talking peace think about what they might say until such time in a circle process were they actually want to say something we've had youth spend a year just holding the talking peace raptly interested in the circle and then a year later find their voice and really talk oh that's wonderful that's wonderful you know when our kids were growing up we use this technique in family meetings
358.35,387.3, fabulous and in so so it sounds like you're talking you mentioned two things you mentioned the empathy when have you ever felt left out and another in the circle the opportunity with someone else's feelings because we've all had those feelings there was another piece that you spoke about besides to empathy and slipping the mind at the moment was that of the one and i want to
387.33,413.61, we move from apathy to action so first people have to understand what it's like for them to be left out and then we ask them to consider when you're walking a school campus at once and somebody sitting alone what must it be like for them and that helps them bridge between what their inner experiences and what somebody else might be feeling and then what the inspired action and they learn
413.7,442.59, yes it actually feels good to go make somebody's day the achmaidon kay so here's another piece for you because i know how talk it environment in middle schools and high schools can be in my say the word topic i'm really talking about this hiragana criticism that kids of feel from their peers and have also internally with their judging themselves so i can imagine walking
442.65,464.25, the hall after being to one of your training and seeing someone who is imagined in the luncheon whatever and my good heart once to go and do something positive to include them but the other part of me is wondering what the fallout might be if i choose to do that the fall out from
464.25,467.55, the peers how do you address that
467.64,528.27, question annie and the way we address it is the peace the appetites have their hopefuller t shirts they know one another there is at least fifty of them on each campus and we tell them if something feels a little sketchy to you or your insecure get another a hopefuller to go with you because we recognize that one of the teen brain challenges is a hyper self consciousness and worry about how they might be judged so we really teach them to rely on each other we don't all have to even make the interventions alone we can do it together it's wonderful and i'm also imagining that in your training you prepare your peace builderback therewithall oiling and miss main surprise our listeners or not the most pushpaka the aeacides have had in five years is from teachers
528.3,532.05, from a dropping a
532.08,542.16, so it's the adults that seemed to have the hardest time with this concept who have been trained in cynicism and skepticism
542.16,566.49, and it's actually not come back to a so much about youth other youth resisting it sometimes we do get problem solving situations like it just came up at the hopefuller training is ten hours but then there in the school club and they need every other week so we stay with them on whatever challenges they have and certainly there's some
566.61,600.0, there that's been really bigoted or exist or horrible may come to us and say well how do i intervene with that without getting that person angry at me or insulting man and we actually coach them through those things in mailer really hard thing to be on the receiving end of some one's anger even though you know you're doing the right thing the casting telltale gin for a dull and i have great apathy for how challenging can be for students
600.12,606.6, yes a man why we teach them that emotion management was the first thing i said we teach them as
606.72,636.33, anger is the natural motion especially when we feel insulted or offended or territories impinged upon and if you honestly look underneath anger is usually fear and hurt so we ask them to take a step back go get the support they need because anger at anger is not productive it doesn't work right so in how long is a training that you do in schools is the first question
636.51,681.15, the training is ten hours during the summer and then the students stay with us all school year long every other week and we also have a minor conference the part i didn't mention which is revolutionary if they also he track of all of their data and interventions on a web application hapshepset door like reipublicae peace and so every week they lain the connection circles they bled their self care their positive peace points the arak owled ment of others so there also training their brains to scan for the positive and documented
681.15,685.95, okay so how do the students who come to doing the summer here about the program
686.49,698.13, the schools that were working with we have a great relationship with the ad men and they with the teachers and we ask for repeal of the demographic of the apsides
698.25,706.5, or represent the microcosm of the school campus in is their charge for the students of disco pay for it
706.95,715.17, at the really important question yeah right you know if i might live to do it for my parents say i am sorry we don't have the money for this
715.26,749.94, the way it is right now and believe me it's a big challenge we actually pay the students a stipend we consider the job we do the fund raising the schools have raised some money to help us but were non profit we rely entirely at this point on individual donations on grant on corporate donations and were always sunrising that is wonderful so there should be no barriers to any student who says you know what i could be a positive leader for change in my school
750.39,754.77, not only that they do get paid and it goes under howsmaid
754.83,786.69, because here's the bottom line what job better prepare you for life than learning how to get along with people and help people feel more included an important in the community and so if you have that skill set going on into the world and into your career that becomes a very valuable asset i am so encouraged to hear you talk about this jennifer because too often i go into schools and i'm the person who is doing the anti bullying
786.75,805.23, one off and there i am for fifty minutes on the stage and when things is gray and the man then check off the fact that we did that one in this no follow up and that's not how you get changed but your proached
805.95,882.66, gotten training and you continue to stay connected with them and vice for this is this is awesome yeah yeah it's our passion in our life work it's our callisthenes cadaleene learning how to be inspired and apathetic and compassionate and strong leaders we have a chance is how i had it it's a very hopeful model that you have here and i pledge you for it we only have a couple more minutes and i would live for you to give our listeners anderson to learn where on the web they can find out more about your beltramo places is a website for non profit a haartman the subject and constantly writing articles and books and my website is jennifer freed at rendcombe
