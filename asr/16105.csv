0.03,41.82, to everyone i am elizabeth roger or the community engagement specialists at the rapidan and this is our monthly t show city connections where we talk about current city issues to day i have with me a donna
41.85,70.83, community advocates and russell instead repeating communists and equity pack member they frequently attend city commission meetings and so i brought them here to day the talk with us about current topics going on in the city of grenades with a tatar with you absolutely i would like to know why you attend city commission meetings regularly what prompted you to go there and to keep going every week or every other week the housing the house you know i didn't know it was a problem
72.42,78.39, geoffries it was and people stated time acting men like
78.54,80.1, say something
80.13,82.44, so i went out there and
82.5,85.71, i had to say and i found out some things and
86.31,87.75, going back
87.81,96.48, so who contacted you when you said your initially contacted well neighbors friends very neighbors friends are more monroe
96.57,105.15, community so like that just wasn't one problem it was a community problem sure and when you went
105.15,114.93, did you learn that prompted you like they said to keep coming back he said you learned some stuff or werther's nothing that happens in this town that they don't tell us about
117.54,126.12, that when we go to the city millions way find out what's happening in our town but if we don't as kind of like a to read through the media
127.35,130.26, it's good to have hands an information
130.35,133.65, to find out for yourself not just to rely
133.65,135.33, somebody else is working
135.54,143.04, and rustle would about you a prompt attend city for mismating unregulated basis will outstarted i think out of bed
143.1,153.39, desire to be as informed as possible winkledon as said the city does tell you when you got a kind of show up to know what's happening and
153.48,196.05, i was been born and raised in grand rapids are but i was on the road for a long time about six years traveling round the us and seeing other communities and coming back to michigan over that is on the road for about six months a year roughly and coming back and forth and between the travel and seeing my community grow in the way that it was growing and realized that the economic growth and the social growth that we were doing it was disparities crisis policing problems so that i can try and any way i can as a community member to help in any way i can
196.44,214.5, to adoniram to the city commission meetings and you learn the issues as community advocate what do you do after that how do you take that news back to your community i normally to go wi one in there and i will start getting feedback as soon as i go in and face book
214.65,219.21, the post at shared and that's how interact with the lot of the community
219.54,257.67, and what about you rustle what do you do with the information you blame others to ethics i do a little bit of sigourneys for the opinion which i think is a great great thing of anybody out there is not familiar with the repentance be it's a great way to be in as informed as possible on what's happening in your city but there's also equity pack as you mentioned i also a member of that section of what coasting as much information out to its members as possible and relentings like that gather information and distortion
257.85,308.1, take a second and this elaborate a little bit more on what equity pack is for people that don't know you know equity pack is political action committee that's in grand rapids that's focused directly on equity issues and getting equity minded leadership into positions in the city government in the county school boards all of those sorts of things as well as any sort of sustentation of the inequitable indomitable point of view came and
308.1,322.59, there focused out of micro level right at our local level sitting in county and oi think a great approach for change a madonna yes what are the greatest issues angriest are of concern to you right now
323.28,325.35, and placing
325.59,335.49, can you elaborate on the housing one first and then we'll get to placing well in the last couple of years there been a surge and homeless families and
336.0,342.66, i think families for the first time have experienced homelessness and never experienced that but with the
343.71,366.21, what the surgeon housing demand for housing in the prices going up is really hard for families to afford housing such as you have to make three times the rent when the average person makes a round four hundred dollars a week after taxes and rent twelve hundred dollars so it's it's kind of like the new discrimination of your poor
367.11,375.75, you can't have any felonies so that say you of i went to prison in years ago and got a felony it could be held against me
376.08,383.1, have to have a high credit score of six fifty or higher rooked scores can get you a house
383.34,385.14, so 
385.29,388.41, they just there making it difficult
388.53,390.75, if you don't have money than
391.14,393.54, fit in and gratiano
394.56,399.09, i don't have money don't fit in greater poor it applies to you
401.13,402.81, and russell
402.84,404.76, you what do you see as
404.82,472.05, issue housing crisis for sure and policing as well if you go to the city commission meanings there's a time period at the end of every commission meeting that's given to the public to speak on issues that are important to the novelist gooseberries train
472.08,473.01, i think that
473.1,500.82, we hear from city leaders quite frequently that they would like to be innovators or to be seen as one role on how to solve these types of problems they want to do that they need to step off a box a little more esotericist applying these here not utopian
500.94,524.64, accountable for properties that there they are hiking the rent up and taking advantage of poor families on those types of things i think they really need to step up toward the community an what would you like to add on your concerns with the policing because you also mentioned it and your answer will the way that the place is handled in the inner city is
526.83,530.4, how they had handled the manner were in the suburbs
530.4,532.5, i think that we're targeted
534.27,536.64, a lot of crimes because we
537.3,542.4, target we get stopped just for walking the course of
543.9,557.76, in your pocket or no be caught with possession if you have some entire intoxicants then they're going to know about that when they stop you there not stopping people like that in the suburban areas but were profiled
558.57,565.95, ay and the inner city and i think the police are kind of cocky with how they do it an arrogant
566.22,571.35, and i have even been taught to and disrespected by the police that you know
573.69,576.09, it's a big power for us
577.53,579.09, black and brown people
580.11,588.27, and the sense bringing to city commission meetings and seeing how it's been addressed what has been your take away on how it's been handled it
588.36,593.67, the commission meeting and and how the chief is responding and how the departments responding
593.76,596.79, i think they're going to respond
597.42,606.6, a way that pacifies everybody there not going to admit in their not going to deny and they're going to always dance around the reality of it
608.25,609.54, i really do
609.69,619.41, you have anything you wanted to add to that rustle i think that's a very accurate way to put it i mean case in point would be the traffic stop study that just came out we had
619.41,640.23, lead up to this study the lambert consulting study he found that there was undeniable evidence of racial profiling traffic stops if you were an african american motorist in this within the city or two times more likely to be led
640.83,646.68, i came out and the city stepped forward the chief stepped forward at the five meetings that they held and
647.1,650.37, responsibility tried to and then
650.58,651.69, in a week
652.23,685.44, stepped back and put some how this report from a counter counterpoint all that nobody asked for and that report just so happens to be from the consulting firm that's the former chief of granitic department and it's disputing the findings and now the police unions are pushing
685.74,703.77, some strong leadership from city officials and from community members to step forward and demand that we do not step back that we demand that the city take responsibility we demand that the police department take responsibility for these issues and the city reposing
703.83,714.99, in a forge sive way and a pro active way and that they have to take responsibility for that and start taking action rather than just talking about it
715.2,738.93, soon as on what you learned at the city commission meetings and going and getting warbled in community advocacy how are you and your neighbors handling what are you doing with what you've learned or people still advocating at the city have they given up on the city and they're doing their own methods what are you see happening or neighborhood in the african american community is
739.47,741.03, people have left
741.42,746.31, at so i gave a gave people opportunity look one afresh tire
746.46,750.81, go elsewhere but everybody is fortunate to make that move
750.99,755.04, and i think a lot of people are full in hopelessness
755.46,757.77, come out because
757.77,761.76, taken accountability you say you represent us
761.76,763.08, represent us
763.32,764.73, the city
764.79,769.44, really do that because if they represent us we wouldn't be in this position
770.22,772.56, i think they let us do
772.92,776.88, i think they want poor people down and when the
776.88,780.75, when the town was drug infested it was good enough for us
781.05,782.97, they made a lot of money
785.58,787.08, criminals here
787.17,789.48, and then we were disposable
790.23,795.96, disposable and and we had the same visions and i want that
796.08,825.21, everybody else had for wealthy straight and for all time and for cherry hill we had those of its same visions but we weren't given opportunities to get the laws and to get financial backing you know were not trust fund babies we come from the poor part of the inner city and people say they're just sittin there an abandoned but really we want em ianthina abandoned building if you don't have the resources and the finances to do so
826.74,832.89, you and also with what you have learned in your involvement in equity pack how do you see
833.13,854.16, that moving forward a response to the things that have happened so i think like i said strong leadership is needed strong community involvement is needed if we we don't have strong community involvement if we don't have people like without there advocating for the people who are being most affected by these things than
854.52,859.5, we lose the pressure of accountability an elected officials so i think
859.59,861.15, where equity pack
861.9,874.44, its strongest portion of of what they do is the fact that if you can get involved in organizations like that are that are politically motivated that's where these people challenge and
874.59,887.94, a systemic problem when we were talking in the city and community we have a systemic problem that you know housing crisis the police and problem gentian all of these things in my opinion are
888.0,891.63, symptoms of that systemic problem and that systemic problem is races
892.14,894.21, and
894.99,965.91, less we address that and at its core i don't think we're going to be able to treat all of the other symptoms that are out there on that problem and part of that is getting equitable leadership or leaders from community wholeheartedly into buccaneers
967.35,968.94, a level that you can be
969.0,975.54, thank you for bringing up the equity and the diversity the dona you were talking about the earlier he loved to hear you
975.81,988.02, take on that what you meant when you said that well of course you see a lot of white people moving into the inner city where there is predominantly black and 
988.2,1012.23, people were sociable people we wave we interact with their neighbours we visit we sit on the porch and when i'm seeing is the millenniums trustable just live they were intend they just exist and they don't interact with the neighbors and i really afraid that with with the laconic
1012.23,1020.93, there when initiate when contact is initiated the it's going to be the one kind of contact is goin the negative way
1020.99,1024.98, and i think that it's going to be because of the cultural difference
1025.19,1026.93, wyatt
1027.11,1038.3, we have just a couple of minutes left overseer so or anything else that you like to bring up here that you'd like to get reiteration yes aconite okay ever you do
1038.36,1039.95, consistent
1040.04,1041.99, and no matter
1042.02,1045.47, how small you think your opinion is it's in us
1045.62,1049.79, come and do things collectively we could go far with that
1050.21,1051.65, consistency
1051.83,1055.91, that's thank you and what about you russell
1055.97,1076.25, i don't know if i could put it anybody than that i think consistency just be involved in any way you can if it's just watching reading the news being as informed as you possibly can have in these conversations with family members with friends don't be eradication
1076.37,1087.89, anything you'd like to add a danaan how people can be involved or what you think people holtercation meeting to morrow so aerostation it some o'clock 
1087.89,1094.58, city building i think it's the monotony for seven pam free parking
1094.76,1107.03, so on again a city commission meeting is to morrow at seven o'clock he said three hundred miraband morland i have nine for in the half and every other totally twice more
1107.21,1131.21, necessarily every other two elaborate real quick to go to their website the city's website has a list of all of the date of the commission meetings is not necessarily twice a month once every other week is only twice a month so sometimes it's two weeks in a row sometimes there's two weeks and between
1131.24,1160.52, thank you for none
1161.72,1217.88, the opinion for the community provides an alternative to be the eyes of somebody who's not there was more honest more than i and more true and have the freedom to talk about things because the things that need to be talked about not because look at readers or reviewers or click sometimes i feel intimidating to write a new story or to write a story about a community issue what i love about the repudiated they make it really simple and easy to nalikhan to meet this dead line by this time it beating a silent in one hand that i might typometer i love the freedom to be of the right from wherever i think it's a really powerful experience when people are able to tell their story and to be heard any land can have a lift anybody can speak is a platform for the community to tell its own story a very authentic way and as powerful community has to be involved in order for it to be sustainable
1218.0,1220.61, so it tells you something about our community

1526.01,1530.03, and it's a great opportunity just connect with our neighbors

1783.5,1787.25, as a new opportunity for us programs to be
1787.25,1790.07, considered for a youth of words so that
1790.19,1798.26, i knew the share for our pride and i think also we collaborate frequently with
1798.41,1831.44, prison programming and so jackie's actually there working on a workshop we meet the chair a little bit about that that's the laboratories that happens this summer but that series will continue to the fallen headstalls which is referring to his workshop one stays which is a new series of sirhassen had our first workshop last month we had a seeming workshop and we tried to cover a wide range of subjects and have that open and accessible to the community this month we have next week

1859.4,1865.55, i work vacations or artists or the continent really focus on their work but
1865.7,1885.02, a lot of people don't know about them a lot of people don't know how to play for them a lot of people don't know how to raise funds to get there or how to make the most of it or having a round table discussion where people will be talking to people who have experience going to those and the ability to assuage it
1885.11,1891.26, well we having a workshop about spinning or work to literary journals which is a kind of an undertoned
1891.26,1895.91, we're going to have another from a literary journal come in and talk about that
1896.03,1897.02, and
1897.17,1928.97, that's going to be it's going to be really fun and exciting our last workshop had a really great turnout which was surprising and relics we have high hopes for the future with that perfect and that's the artist residence specifically as elaboration or price of the ailantus there a castor any of these workshops i talked about so far at maltese were sustainer
1930.86,1968.96, a perfect opportunity for me to bring you in maria because we talked a little bit about collaboration tell but the upcoming dropping hours the opinion is hosting at the abduction to be actually at the avenue to morrow morning you can find there fittletetot writing journey so you know if your some one who's written frostbit want to come back in and maybe have some ideas you kind of want about off us or maybe you just want to ask questions you need don't really want to write you just kind of want to hear

1970.82,1976.1, for this kind of getting started making get used up with an account everything ready right then
1976.16,1981.98, it kind of takes pressure of people i think in kind of a security more engaged in what's happening

1998.75,2010.93, grabbing off i want to bring your own coffee thank you for a sorry so if all talked in some way she performed about collaboration and i think it's
2011.02,2023.41, sort of special out of collaboration that i see now between organizations in the arts community with neighborhood associations can you talk about the need for collaboration and why it
2023.47,2028.93, critical to get some of the work done and accomplish some of the long term goals your organization has
2029.74,2034.87, were were even peticlar
2035.02,2044.68, the other is a program actually does it we do create some events but really what were known for is that claverton 
2044.68,2049.84, we bring together the businesses and non profit along with caution quarter to host
2049.87,2058.87, first fridays amongst also to do creative community problem solving some right now were working on advocating for better better lighting along the south of it and quarter
2059.02,2065.02, you know one person says he we need more light and no one was any as were heard from the earlier segment
2065.02,2066.79, everyone shows up
2067.03,2094.99, together as one singular voice we say and we need more alienating lot more seriously and people look only say wow it relies kanadian comes at all levels it comes from individuals working together it comes from communities or contributor comes from noon
2095.14,2125.38, and using their voice and however they can and so yet and i think that one of the things that the avenue does so well as make those sort of ways to get engaging engage accessible for people and i think you know the focus on making sure that the collaborators
2125.44,2126.16, just
2126.22,2127.6, like that can
2127.6,2133.27, to ascertainment engagement and the collaboration and strengthening the community
2133.27,2136.03, with that and it's the avenues and
2136.03,2152.08, very advocate for people who you know have gone to art school haven't gone art school and a good article mansoor work it just kind of incurred this everyone to kind of be supported on each other instead of competitive as art community is definitely more of kind of like a web and kind of
2152.14,2171.25, getting together and fostering each other's work i think and that's something that i've heard from multiple people too that this art community is really focused on building a heading a resource richter instead of competing telephone to the timanyoni help me in its
2171.25,2175.75, a really great definitely agree so we've talked a little bit about
2176.44,2181.63, how to get engaged in terms of workshops if you're new to the arts community
2181.84,2184.81, your first step be where should you go
2185.11,2198.22, their dumb questions that you shouldn't ask i mean how do you get plugged in initially in saradwata of that network i'm glad you asked untidy we actually have an avenue carburation from ten until noon
2198.4,2207.94, anybody who has those ponderous questions like what is this process do i get all i'd like to show our work and have no idea where to start for there
2208.0,2217.81, but we also you know i ramming to the orientation of course ten is not open for over maybe you've got other things go on during that time
2217.9,2224.2, their great opportunity would be on wastcote picnic and just dropping in and
2224.26,2228.31, you have a question fell bold elfreda that's why we're there
2228.34,2239.56, but also if you just want to explore and get to know in your own kind of feel it out first fridays are a great opportunity and the other thing that i would play is that the avenue tears
2239.56,2249.22, try and put all of our content into and i just will for maeuserle ter as one word kearsarges so sign up for the new letter on our website
2249.55,2264.97, reinstatement it goes in about weird funky file that we all love and also despised for male like redit because we put opportunities a merry put all of our coming events and as a really great resource and and of course
2265.48,2270.46, as a mother rat resource and conducting the avenue we have both a page and a group
2270.82,2304.36, i think they have distinctively different flavors so the page is more institutional voice here opportunities in the group is lots of people sharing so resources have what was on her to day and i feel like there is always like artillery
2305.38,2309.37, so i've got about a minute or so left before we and our segment
2309.88,2315.94, words anything else you'd like our viewers to know about the avenue or the arts community

2620.95,2627.13, back to city connection i'm turned pale and i'm here with us robertson who is 
2627.28,2633.34, see border and a community journalist welcome places
2633.34,2647.98, really curious about the piece that you just published on the rapidan in mid june your peace was titled navigating through pride and prejudice tell me about this piece and what inspired you to write it is about me being a
2648.1,2658.54, a black man and grand rapids i know sounds like yet of course you are but it was a very interesting kind of take for me to be very local about it
2658.63,2661.42, and the timing was perfect it was doing pride
2661.54,2668.5, and they were quite actually came from a friend she's a fellow runner and blogger she bogs is called
2668.62,2672.22, better forgetting it's called
2672.43,2673.99, echoes of the struggle
2674.11,2686.2, a log about diversity discrimination and people find open skills throughout life so she requested that i give my opinion i am prospective
2686.2,2687.76, what it means to be
2687.88,2694.72, during pride and black solitary interesting intersection of conversations so
2695.05,2696.73, this is a particularly
2696.76,2715.63, important lesson for people that might be watching number one because of the material covered but number two because of you stepping out and telling your story so gives a word of wisdom to people who might be out there and hesitant to write as far as how they can go on a similar journey as you did osorio
2715.99,2724.6, going to do that because you have to be like you know really old and cool and i'm pretty young piece of the vice
2724.84,2726.37, in case
2726.61,2736.18, i think everyone has a past whether that is coming out and being gay or coming out and being trans or coming out into being you
2736.42,2738.25, and in close
2738.25,2740.29, it as hard as he can
2740.44,2743.35, don't be afraid to walk out of it and share the experience
2744.79,2748.48, does get better i know that sounds very pleased but
2751.42,2754.39, plus years i've been alive i learned that
2754.42,2755.77, your story
2755.89,2758.38, not a privilege and a right
2758.8,2762.01, and to find connection in the community
2762.07,2765.25, it's our neighbors or online
2765.4,2767.77, the most beautiful experience
2768.04,2770.92, it's scary and i think that
2770.92,2773.17, in gives you that
2773.29,2774.79, ability that tool
2775.15,2776.17, and
2776.32,2782.23, been on the board i didn't realize how powerful it was until i realized that i editha a story
2782.41,2783.79, i wanted to tell it
2783.85,2785.05, a kind
2785.23,2790.42, great that's fantastic tell me about where you broadly look for inspiration
2790.51,2792.1, do you consume
2792.22,2799.18, how does that inspire you then to write until your own story shamed for me i pose
2799.54,2812.14, create regularly on ingram i figured out this nettings to my niece which i love from obsessed with and also faces so i am a new junk
2812.2,2815.2, loopings and
2815.77,2820.36, i know where to put it i mean i can look match is great but
2821.47,2825.52, every piece of content does something to me or a spark something inside me
2825.58,2829.99, and i realize i actually had a platform to talk about that
2830.05,2832.39, and that's where i get most of
2832.51,2835.12, actually that's where i get all of my content it's
2836.44,2838.75, conversations with friends
2838.75,2843.31, its articles its comments on my post
2843.43,2845.86, that's where the story starts from me
2847.45,2852.79, so what about community media you are on the board with us community medium mean to you
2853.0,2854.8, honestly
2854.86,2856.09, more now
2856.33,2859.33, i understood the platform
2859.45,2861.88, mission why we there
2862.48,2863.5, but
2863.74,2865.45, get into the community
2865.54,2866.86, friends that
2866.89,2871.6, pull me from wanting to be actually engaged were my community it means a lot more
2871.72,2875.77, so many thousands of thousands of stories there are untold
2876.01,2878.14, let's be honest on her
2878.41,2881.5, we have hidden figures in our own community
2881.83,2885.88, and for me this platform allows them to have a voice
2886.21,2891.04, that is nothing to be taken lightly what it means is
2891.76,2894.31, my mary grandma says to me which is
2894.85,2896.41, your voice is powerful
2896.68,2898.96, no use it is up to you
2899.29,2902.59, for every voice there is an ear that will listen to it
2902.98,2905.35, and i feel the same way about
2905.83,2909.22, journalism but about the same 
2909.22,2913.15, they learn how incredible it was until i actually
2913.33,2915.16, as for my own voice
2915.37,2921.67, that's why we encourage more people to do it was kind of scary at first but it was so sinless
2921.7,2922.57, and
2922.9,2927.88, promise you i have dreams of grandeur when it comes in a writer
2928.15,2935.95, this is something in new york were the was more like busier the blood all in all still was vosmaer and made me feel like
2937.15,2938.44, matters
2938.68,2957.43, so something has got to be stirring in your mind as far as where you're going next and what you want to cover next tell me about her inspiration what we can expect from your next i am actually write an article about the comments foresail i wrote i had a great great response
2957.46,2958.93, very positive comments
2959.17,2961.36, some not so positive comments
2961.45,2962.95, and
2963.1,2966.73, even people pointed out some holes in my opinion piece
2967.66,2969.64, every unrepresented
2969.88,2974.65, but there are so many communities within our own community that don't have a voice
2974.95,2982.39, so i think that's where i'm going with my next one the title which is working is called the true underneath the rainbow bridge
2982.66,2992.05, it's about me actually being looking at these comments reacting to it and realizing that this platform of being gay and averse
2992.08,2997.18, something deeper than that there's something more system to
2997.36,3009.45, struggle and so i'm going to be working on the right now and hopefully we'll have something soon so i find it interesting that you responded in a constructive way to the comments because it can be
3009.99,3033.6, an be a dark place on the web a lot of comments but what i mean what within you in you know felt inspired to take this and go forward with it and not recoil from these comments this is what i call the orchestra going to answer it honestly i got in touch with my interlopers who like reeds comments and even though you know it not
3034.23,3045.21, not the proper thing to do sometimes it gets stuck in those conversations and see the negativity or you comment on something and not give constructive feedback on it
3045.36,3050.07, and i should be ashamed of it but i mean that's part of social media
3051.66,3055.86, me the most was i really got into the minds of
3056.31,3058.11, my intention was article
3059.1,3062.52, the world barely going change and the pain
3062.61,3064.38, i am going to
3064.41,3065.91, constitute my voice
3066.24,3072.15, i feel and surprisingly my opinion after the article has changed
3072.24,3077.04, about the flag or its representation in the community
3077.07,3083.28, how i see it has changed i think that's the power of journalism
3083.28,3085.56, i had an idea
3085.59,3087.78, steadfast belief
3088.02,3090.9, based on comments based on engagements
3090.96,3094.65, based on conversations with people a changed
3095.07,3097.71, i can say i grew and
3097.71,3101.13, kind of where the root of my next article was going to ingrow
3101.43,3107.7, it already but you said your voice matters why a story telling so important
3107.73,3114.66, at this moment in grand rapids i mean we've heard a little bit about the issues hawwy de stories matter when it comes to creating change
3114.72,3123.81, matter because most people get there and pression of a person of community based on the the contempt consume
3124.11,3129.78, yes we can some are white washed there very they're not diverse
3131.13,3132.3, example
3132.81,3139.11, easy for me to be pitching hold like with friends or co workers but having a voice
3139.44,3144.69, a representation in a community that is miss represented
3145.35,3146.4, power
3146.61,3147.66, and
3147.81,3152.52, i'm on the only gay person in grand rapids last unicorn
3152.7,3155.01, i have a voice and it matters
3155.28,3161.55, i think that's the point i think the point is your story a real big or medium
3162.69,3165.09, and we actually have a home for you
3165.09,3166.32, i know your voice
3166.65,3167.58, and
3167.7,3168.96, a kind of cool
3172.44,3181.11, first hear about the rapidan and the community media center i was approached by a couple of people to check it out
3181.23,3184.11, for it was hesitant because you know it's
3184.68,3188.34, i rather watch t v but i realized that
3188.4,3190.65, to live in the community i live in
3190.98,3193.44, i have to know the stories of my community
3193.59,3196.8, i can't kiss all babies and shake all hands
3197.22,3201.81, the rapidan the mc gives me an opportunity of seeing a lot of stories
3201.84,3203.22, short amount of time
3203.52,3206.07, decide where i want to invest my energy
3206.25,3207.15, and
3207.15,3210.78, i was recruited into the cord
3210.84,3214.14, friends and through some coworkers which was awesome
3214.62,3219.93, he got a chance to talk a lot about you how long have you lived in grand rapids are you from michigan
3219.99,3222.93, questions i lived here
3222.93,3228.45, before and a half years i am originally from texas i'm materfamilias
3228.66,3232.8, and yet so i kind of bounced around in a lot of places but
3232.95,3235.5, has been home for the last four and a half years
3237.75,3242.76, you excited about any one particular part of the community or what
3243.09,3245.13, who have been seeing 
3245.19,3248.22, i am excited by the frustration
3248.28,3249.81, excited with
3250.02,3254.13, the prospect of people caring and not only tearing
3254.19,3260.37, but being involved in the community and not just by liking on face book or sharing a snap that
3260.37,3262.71, people are frustrated
3262.83,3266.91, they are looking for somewhere to voice testation
3266.91,3271.05, we welcome home this is the place so i like that
3271.29,3273.99, so great that's the first i've heard that 
3275.91,3287.4, is there anything else that's on your mind that you'd like to bring up at this point or that you're curious about maybe that you want to see other rapidan writers explore perhaps yes
3288.09,3290.91, the opinions call because it's what you may get
3291.06,3296.58, you ask about editor content calendars if your journalist there's always a voice
3296.64,3297.93, the voice
3298.11,3300.33, only as good as you put into it
3300.54,3301.56, and
3301.59,3308.58, is there a huge welcome mat for the opinion they really do want your stories and for me i
3308.58,3312.6, stories that great but now that there's a place for me isabetta
3312.72,3317.49, and that's not a shameless plug its actual i've done it so if i can do
3317.52,3322.65, try and get it out there i've promised you you can to
3322.65,3329.79, still spell checking so they're a lot of struggles with me but i got published so
3330.21,3332.97, here is critical
3333.06,3343.83, i just want to invite you as well we have our drop in hours this tuesday the eleventh and on the tenth and you are welcome to common and we can help you work on that
3343.92,3381.87, so that you have in the works i will be there think you relapse that perfect thank you so much she said much
3383.64,3439.86, the opinion for the community provides an alternative to be the eyes of somebody who's not there was more honest more than i and more true and have the freedom to talk about things because the things that need to be talked about not because look at readers or reviewers or click sometimes it feels intimidating to write a new story or to write a story about a community issue what i love about the rapidan is that they make it really simple and easy to the like you have to meet this deadline by this time to be eating a salad in one hand and that i might typometer i love the freedom to be of the right for wherever i think it's a really powerful experience when people are able to tell their story and to be heard any land can have a lift anybody can speak is a platform for the community to tell its own story in a very authentic way and as powerful community has to be involved in order for it to be sustainable
3439.92,3442.56, so it tells you something about our community
