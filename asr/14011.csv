1.5,10.65, he
12.51,91.5, i'm not sure that i found the right place for my husband but i certainly found the right place for me and my boys so were three happy he still adjusting far monitor my name is micheltorena an interior designer and i was base out of los angeles we decided to move to tatanemance an exhaustive search of the cities to move to we wanted a better life for our children in a nicer place for ourselves and maybe a little more being for a buck the moorside ure we drove across country so being in the caroline days with the two boys out as fine a little do we saw some beautiful sky and only saw some big monuments and stone things a lot of nature so mutantur on the way
91.62,95.7, and we arrived in canongate
95.73,97.62, and here are
100.05,121.89, i think it's going to be really good i think the brows raised in the country so i like country living they can go out the front door and they've got all the space and they can run and they can play and they know their neighbours and they don't have to worry about their neighborhood of their location
121.98,135.15, when michel told me that they how they came about their decision to move out here i thought that just then must be the bravest man in the whole world i think my husband is a little upset that i moved him
135.24,178.2, it further outside the city that he was planning a kind of understood smaller city smaller town a little more rural okonha wheeling a little bit more extreme than i was expecting with michel in our planning got a big barn and there's acres and there's pasture and i don't know what gonadal
178.56,180.3, something
180.36,210.96, she is much acreage i i just don't know what to do with it maybe you will make the barn a gestatio you do with all this land because there's there's far as an there's animals this chicken it's just it's a beautiful piece of land and it is very common i see all these powlett's positives of life oh there's no light pollution oh there's no end to me that's just dangerousness very unsettling
212.91,269.4, i was looking for a house that needed work because i liked to put my own stamp on things of course said so you know it needs a whole new kitchen and everything that's in the houses pineries and so you can kind of see that in the way things were done it really doesn't need any work on these systems anything like that which is kind of great most of the money will go into making a pretty it's harder i think for a designer to do their own home than threatened other people's homes because you like so many things and youse've to so many things and that's half my job as a designer is cutting down the options for some one so that unpresented them with maybe two or three fabrics after i've looked at five hundred yokohama since i am so exposed to all those things i have all those things in my head
269.46,271.83, the little hard in that respect
272.46,296.61, so having its evolving the benefits of moving here to the south have been well it lower and sometimes that's a little frustrating but most of the time his relaxing
297.69,304.86, go outside and there's no noise there's just bird singing and really beautiful
305.04,309.06, there except for the animals that i hear like
309.24,342.21, my head going crazy but it going to come a taximeter and los angeles was completely refer based so i have you know spent years just making a name for myself really and that's worked out really well it done well and coming here i was like you novation in great portfolio people can go on my website and look you know and franklin
342.57,359.16, so that's the interesting but they are going to throw me a parade or something i guess but people have been ridiculously nice to us i think it was the first day we got here i got to jars of jam and flowers from people's gardens
359.34,361.41, and truth
361.41,383.82, from people in the trees and you know it was sort of amazing and everybody that's a neighbor came and introduced themselves to us i would imagine that is normal or around most of the country is just now very languor maybe it's not maybe i'm living in a wonderland for sometimes i think i am living in a wonderland
