22.8,27.3, here at the garden project which is located at the san francisco county jail
27.93,31.23, this is the farm at the county jail
31.44,33.42, i have been here since
33.78,36.06, the 
37.98,41.61, before that for i got a job here i
42.24,47.85, at new college i begin in the class that started 
48.42,50.01, i just had a baby
50.46,53.7, once i got my acceptance letter
54.33,55.92, i didn't think i would get
55.95,59.43, i i didn't know what i would do with the brand new baby
59.64,63.39, i started a nursery school cooperative
63.45,64.5, women
65.19,66.54, who
66.75,71.43, also or either in school or working and together we took care of our kids
71.76,82.32, i would bring me one of the things that we did as we would you know everybody had a day when they had the kids i would bring all the kids to new come
82.62,86.04, in fact all of them would stay in micheline's office
86.46,88.5, which always surprised him
88.83,102.72, what is that my master as did meet like a man she a new collar wolters yes well i today so i
102.81,105.93, started nurse school and i was able to go to school
107.01,107.85, and
108.84,110.04, first
111.93,113.7, impression of new college
114.87,116.25, the law school
117.15,118.8, i had
119.61,124.38, came to california california from nor new jersey i had it
124.38,128.85, when i was and i came here because
128.91,134.73, no i didn't think i could achieve my dream which was to be a criminal lawyer
135.15,136.26, i
136.86,140.04, somehow got it in my head that i wanted to be a criminal lawyer
140.1,141.78, i was nine years old
141.93,145.65, one reason that i wanted to be a criminal lawyer was
145.74,147.48, because i had brothers
147.57,149.52, even at nine years old
149.79,155.49, i believe that if my brothers ever were in jail which i thought they would be
155.76,157.98, i was a lawyer i can help get them out
158.4,165.33, and so i really wanted to be a lawyer and people discouraged me might and high school they said you know
165.36,168.33, being a nervous secretary or a nurse
168.39,170.37, no i want to be a lawyer
170.58,178.8, my family my father wanted me to be an army nurse no i want to be a lawyer so i get to amazing letter excepting me to this low cool
179.07,179.88, and
180.39,186.93, i started the nursery school i show up and first of all there were any other parents in my class
187.2,188.64, twenty one
188.85,191.91, the other young people were
192.0,195.24, at that age i think there were some people may be older than me
195.3,198.57, so at first i really felt like i didn't belong there
198.72,201.84, you know i don't belong here there's no other parents
201.84,203.43, understand
203.55,206.94, no poor person here i was on food stamps
207.09,208.47, i was
209.31,212.28, alewife my first started
212.46,214.32, college
214.83,220.62, and so for the first couple of months like the sort of like i don't belong here
221.49,222.57, then
224.88,226.26, meeting the students
226.26,227.49, all
228.48,230.16, very welcoming
230.28,233.25, very different from people that i had one
234.42,237.06, the thing that really struck me about the students
237.24,238.59, they
240.81,241.98, so
242.61,245.16, filled with this amazing energy
246.66,250.44, the energy that was like anything is possible
250.44,263.16, we don't have to accept the now don't have to accept that it can't happen and you shouldn't give up just because you have two babies but you have to take care of you can do it the other students said to me
263.46,270.06, i alone that so and so every day when i would show up
271.41,273.24, one would encourage me
274.26,276.27, you know i 
276.36,278.79, had never met any
278.94,282.69, people like our instructors like our professors
283.08,284.64, i
285.51,286.44, was
286.83,289.02, impressed with susan jordan
289.44,291.0, susan jordan
294.9,299.16, i think the thing that really struck me about her was that she
300.99,302.64, practicing law
303.09,307.26, she was practicing law and yet every time we met her
307.41,314.67, she would just really try to impress upon us that if we were to do something we had to know what the law was
314.7,316.89, we also had to understand
317.91,326.01, historical context of the law and how impacts people so it wasn't just good enough to learn all this stuff in the book
326.13,331.47, so she always talked about that she was her she was the criminal law professor
331.68,348.03, and but also she was a young woman and i was like i want to be like her and to end to end to be able to say i want to be like her mean so much to me and and i go home and i would be so excited and my family's like what's going on at that place what's going on
352.2,361.56, again we just with susan and she talked about her work or practice or clients what some of her hurdles had been some of the obstacles
362.85,365.1, she was so giving of herself
365.1,368.13, and you know in the other folks were
368.19,369.3, i mean
369.54,370.89, students
371.37,377.46, i don't i don't know that she made the kind of impression on them that she did
378.9,381.48, because i felt very
382.35,384.54, to her because
384.6,395.07, she is i had as an undergraduate worked as in the public offenders office and and doing the denounce
395.22,420.09, she really encouraged me to continue either working the public sinners office or somewhere and so i said no no i really want to work the public masefield go down there and do it and she gave me some names of some judges since in cloaks and and i went down i said we'll soothing said i can come in your amateur like goosanders that it well you okay wait you do this and by the end of my first year i was doing a raiment in raiment court
421.68,423.63, and
424.14,430.44, the second year i was doing more raiments and by my third year i was doing fenians
430.77,433.26, really again because
433.38,436.32, had gotten his amazing confidence
438.09,440.82, hearing and knowing susan
440.97,444.36, it was also true of the other professors
446.49,448.05, mac
448.5,451.47, you know again this confidence
451.65,453.87, all three of our
454.41,466.68, professor that the confidence in the law and power of the law to help people in the allies and help the world and in understanding the law and in really appreciating
466.74,481.68, should i could do in pushing us to find that i do that and not to jest again get lost in the books or get lost in the prestige or get lost in you know how cool you are when you go to court and do this or do that the power i guess that
481.92,484.29, lawyers may get hooked on
484.59,489.03, he really seemed to be more about helping us
489.09,493.98, understand that we did have the power to do something different
494.13,498.42, things that had been done before us in the law in other areas
498.57,500.46, the things that shouldn't could
500.82,504.96, say the same that they should be changed and that we could do that
507.48,509.07, again the three of them
509.25,514.05, to me peter peters
514.17,518.91, i never thought that i understand anything about contracts
519.06,521.64, yet peter was so confident
521.67,526.71, we could learn he was so confident that it had a place in our lives
526.74,531.51, in the world and but most important a place as a move things forward
531.6,533.01, it wasn't just
533.34,534.48, a box
534.6,538.44, rather it was something that really change people and help
538.62,540.72, a change in a real way
540.93,544.44, like every time every time we
544.44,546.72, with them was the amazing
546.78,550.77, confidence and energy and also
554.31,555.48, sing us
555.75,559.89, to try to keep trying and believing in us
559.89,561.36, we could be
561.39,564.57, and someone that made a difference
566.67,573.36, as i got older and as i've gotten older you know i still think about all three of them
573.66,575.61, and 
576.21,582.06, the other thing that really impressed me and i realized now is that they loved what they were doing
582.57,584.22, that's why they were so good
584.61,585.9, loved
585.99,593.46, the understanding of the law they loved conveying that information to young people not to young people
594.57,595.74, i really
596.91,597.99, made it
598.23,601.05, that i've never experienced again
602.58,608.85, but on the other hand as no kind of a future myself i've tried to hereof emulate
611.61,617.88, and and what i've learned is if you care about what your teaching then it shows
617.97,621.48, it does affect the people that her understanding
621.93,624.06, it helps to
625.47,627.0, people go
627.0,631.32, but also you know you know again thinking about the three of them
631.56,637.62, in thinking that they probably didn't know the power that they had as teachers
638.1,645.6, to take our minds and change and melt them to grow and do something better and bigger
645.93,649.62, but what they had was just what they had in that was
649.62,654.03, knowledge that they had gotten through their experience and through their learning
654.03,656.19, a desire to share it
656.4,658.14, in a meaningful way
659.07,665.28, that don't know how you mineter
668.04,670.77, he
671.22,673.95, in my fourth year at new college
674.58,675.84, this
676.23,677.13, who
678.33,679.32, sure
681.45,683.82, other than them being friends at that time
685.65,688.92, and anyway rates
689.07,690.75, came to our class
690.93,692.04, speak
692.4,694.62, in the
694.62,697.89, prison class and 
698.34,701.22, there
701.22,705.81, she had worked in the sheriff's department but wasn't currently at the sheriff's apartment
706.14,708.93, in michael micheline had
708.96,714.63, i guess was that new college having to develop he started
714.69,715.65, the
715.83,720.33, service program here at the jail and i believe
720.78,724.95, i know it michael had worked together before that
724.98,730.23, and so as i think with come and be a guest speaker at michael's class so ray came
730.44,732.12, to get speaker in his class
732.63,734.19, and
735.27,739.89, they are field or first failed trip was to senorita jail
740.31,741.63, a horrible
742.35,743.91, so i went
743.91,746.7, and after it was so horrible
746.73,759.57, michael is like well you know this is galardon horrible in their treated badly and we have to make some changes in good this and comandante next thing i knew michael was running for share
759.6,769.47, that i said to myself again this is so like new college because okay things are messed up are you going to accept it now we're going to do something about it
769.74,771.3, i believe
773.07,778.41, courage that michael must have had having worked in our jail here in san francisco
778.44,782.88, i say it's wrong with happening here it doesn't work
783.0,785.52, has to change and i will do it
785.82,788.1, and again that was 
788.19,790.8, what new college was about
790.86,796.89, wasn't well it's bad and we're going to you know leave alone it's bad we're going to change it
796.89,799.47, to do the work to make it different
799.68,802.95, michael said i'm goin to run for sheriff
803.85,810.72, that but worse horrible job ever and then he won
810.9,813.12, but again that didn't surprise me
813.15,814.17, because
814.47,816.99, he was not going to let stand
817.08,819.15, garbage that was happening in the jail
819.57,823.86, and i remember him saying more than once
823.89,828.42, now the people had done something wrong but that was not
829.47,832.62, excuse for being for them being mistreated
832.83,836.37, and that was against the law and
836.55,838.23, something about it
838.38,840.78, so he ran for sheriff he won
840.99,843.03, when he went on
844.44,859.77, he offered me a job here at the jail during the legal services to i had i had been doing legal services for them and so for me it meant that i had now had a paycheck my kids could to go to school and with lunch every day and i could lie close for them
859.86,863.34, i could get to work and take care of my family
863.52,866.7, so i of course got took the job
866.85,868.35, i was here
868.35,869.37, yes
869.55,872.13, i developed a kidney disease
873.0,875.28, he said you're not going to survive this
875.46,880.53, i spent a year back and forth and in the hospital
880.56,882.03, in
884.25,886.02, nineteen eighty two
886.68,890.97, and finally he said well there's nothing more we could do he should go home
891.15,893.61, if you want to stay here and you may
893.64,895.08, i
895.08,900.42, michael hennessey and ray came to visit me at the hospital cause people were coming to say good bye
900.75,909.12, and gray brought the grapes of wrath to me because he retraced was an education major he was always giving books and always talking about book
909.27,919.89, i had been a runaway i didn't read a lot of different great books i guess and so he brought the grapes of wrath and he said you know and so feeling sorry for yourself read this great book and is like
920.4,925.44, feeling sorry for myself on dying there saying i'm dying heliobas
926.61,930.33, read the book and i believe that i believed
930.42,935.28, the message of the book was that when you connect people to land their whole
935.46,936.39, so
936.48,938.31, michael king back
938.46,941.49, i was one ready to get sent home
941.64,952.44, michael you know i would really come back to work and i want to bring the prisoners outside because if we could if they could connect to land they would you know
952.47,954.3, really make some changes
954.57,964.86, i like you know when you get out of the hospital absolutely you we can do that it's like i'm getting out osbiorn i'm coming to work to morrow
965.1,967.8, wanted to remission after two years
968.16,972.39, so for two years the prisoners carry me from the jail out here
972.48,978.51, there was nothing here is the jail had stopped using the farm on them they hadn't used it since the
980.55,983.16, so you know was overgrown and all the
983.28,988.08, storage basically become george place and so the prisoners and i
988.44,991.8, clean it up basically for two years
992.01,993.06, but
993.36,994.83, the thing that i really
995.31,996.6, quickly 
996.69,1003.74, prisoners were completely different out here than they were inside inside they were fighting in arguing in doing it knows what all the time it was horrible
1003.89,1011.09, here they first of all a really concerned about me which i hadn't experienced the big concern about other things or anybody
1011.27,1012.5, and
1013.01,1018.29, deputy that they're going to kill her out there and that's good because she had communists let's might be helpful
1018.53,1019.94, and
1020.72,1027.47, every day when the prisoners brought me back the deputy like won't be back to bed and
1027.74,1029.06, it into remission
1029.09,1034.37, the prisoners would come out and they would know what that sound the frogs
1034.46,1038.18, birds and now and it really
1038.24,1042.65, evident that they had not had a connection with the natural world
1042.83,1055.04, that was what missing and there liberty were just joyous out here i mean they were they didn't have one close to the antico and flip flops and you know it is raining a cold every day when i came they're to go
1055.13,1058.22, they carry me out here and deposit me at my oldest
1058.46,1059.96, i went in to remission
1059.96,1064.16, i believe i read intermission because i suddenly had hoped
1064.43,1069.8, that i could make some changes in these people's lives i can make change to my own life and
1071.78,1074.78, and
1076.01,1081.02, continue to let the prisoners come out and by a tender
1081.23,1083.21, as coming out
1083.3,1086.78, and everybody wanted to come out but then they didn't want to believe
1086.78,1091.49, because for a lot of people this was the best life that you know
1091.52,1095.39, so i would ask michael could they stay after their infirmity
1095.66,1099.35, the another got we got us in the moon
1099.65,1104.21, so i started program outside in san francisco
1104.42,1106.37, a project to employ prisoners
1107.06,1122.45, you know i went to mycening michael like you know what are we going to do they you know they want to stay in the jail and they keep coming back and one to don't come back they die and it is horrible and you know i'm glad we're doing the garden but it's not enough what's missing is away for people to
1122.45,1124.7, learn how to work that's what's missing
1124.76,1138.35, know how to work they don't like my father and mother went to work every day so i have that experience a lot of these folks don't and so who's going to hire them and ran over the years and you always lawyers to get people jobs and their offices and
1138.41,1152.54, you know name a lawyer they would hire people you know who had met the new cow and so they would hire the people and you only with relaxed day or maybe through much job they begone or they had taken the people's verses of the gunshot
1153.68,1156.71, so michael was like well
1158.57,1162.26, have a job here when we just do the job here and i like well
1162.29,1165.29, we have an employment program it would be
1165.32,1170.6, these like locations he encouraged me to to
1170.96,1174.98, the garden project of employees former prisoners
1175.22,1177.02, we did that for
1177.71,1181.46, years and we are now employing
1181.76,1184.01, people before they really get
1184.19,1186.08, in the criminal justice system
1186.62,1188.87, some we had eager
1189.32,1191.78, so before we had the two
1191.93,1194.51, our caleche since the
1194.57,1197.6, been sitting them since he was a captain and baby
1199.49,1202.1, these kids you know many of these kids are the kids
1202.37,1205.46, grand kids of the people that i started here with
1205.79,1207.02, and
1207.2,1212.36, now there cabinski in those young people that you met
1212.39,1219.41, they came to me when they were freshmen high school there now a junior in college each summer they worked with us
1219.68,1222.47, the staff for our three teenagers
1223.1,1226.07, and what we do here as we grow thousands of
1226.34,1228.38, of vegetables and we
1228.59,1233.45, there take deliver them to the soup kitchens to project open and
1233.51,1235.82, food pantries in the school
1236.18,1238.1, and basically
1238.82,1245.12, i'm trying to do is teach people how to work and the gardens farms the way to do that
1246.5,1248.03, but also
1248.15,1249.41, again from
1249.44,1251.96, the magical pictures that i add
1252.23,1254.0, i'm trying to
1254.0,1257.39, share with them what i love and that is my
1258.02,1259.16, plans
1260.0,1264.17, after i went in one
1264.17,1268.01, after i went into a mission and before
1270.05,1275.18, for i came back to work i took a leap two yearly
1275.51,1278.21, i went to emerson college in england
1278.33,1283.01, bignami school training older school training school
1283.13,1284.42, with
1284.42,1290.03, by dynamic agriculture course so i did that and then i went to santa cruz there are farming garden
1291.44,1294.83, and came back and started
1294.89,1296.96, isolated
1297.17,1298.31, we've
1300.14,1302.84, a street trees in san francisco
1304.4,1305.48, we had
1306.35,1308.36, contracts with the city now
1310.58,1311.24, we
1314.06,1315.92, a million 
1315.95,1317.57, the last years
1317.96,1319.94, employed thousands of people
1320.39,1321.59, and
1321.95,1323.39, i really do
1324.05,1325.55, new college
1326.0,1327.68, because again
1329.72,1331.4, as a sense that
1332.21,1334.94, you believe in yourself and you believe
1335.03,1336.26, people
1336.35,1337.82, to do something
1338.15,1340.73, but also if you work with other people
1340.88,1342.38, together i'll get one
1342.89,1346.76, that's what i say that's what i believe new college was about
1347.48,1353.96, sitooation milady omar
1354.77,1358.22, the same
1358.28,1360.89, he
1361.31,1364.37, i 
1367.7,1369.44, again i think
1369.53,1372.89, what i've learned again from the magic people
1374.75,1377.18, love what you do and leaving
1377.66,1379.25, really impacts people
1379.88,1380.69, and
1382.1,1383.45, i really did
1383.81,1386.21, the air
1386.33,1388.04, or
1392.45,1397.49, would i can talk about is that i guess the restorative justice part
1397.58,1400.07, i know when experience is
1400.31,1401.75, folks who
1402.29,1403.55, no
1403.61,1405.5, belief that they have a future
1405.71,1413.63, helping them to create a future for themselves by learning how to work learning how to take care of themselves learning to give to others
1414.05,1418.85, i think that is a restorative in itself
1422.6,1425.36, also helping people to understand that
1426.98,1431.93, all connected in her down it doesn't just affect that senior and effects all of us
1431.96,1434.15, the person who did it
1434.33,1435.32, all
1435.5,1438.71, helping people to see that when i first started
1439.19,1442.85, vegetables away one of the places that we gave them to
1443.81,1445.19, and
1445.19,1447.05, he did that because
1447.05,1448.52, the prisoners
1448.82,1453.26, talk about their past where they would pray on people
1453.26,1457.13, many of them would say well we prayed on gay people because they were vulnerable
1457.34,1461.66, and it seemed to me that if they began to see the
1462.02,1466.43, that they were praying or as people that they then wouldn't be able to pray in the
1466.43,1476.48, many of them said you know after we started taking a vegetable to broodeth couldn't take it couldn't do that any more i couldn't knock out out people and take their money or hurt them
1476.93,1478.22, in
1479.21,1482.39, i think again understanding
1483.08,1485.84, criminal justice system and how 
1486.02,1487.82, has its limitations
1491.36,1496.67, learned that actually what i wanted to be was not a lawyer but someone
1496.67,1499.07, could help people to stay out of jail
1499.25,1504.59, and when i realized that lawyers help but to get out don't help them to stay out
1504.74,1508.58, i realized that this was the path that i wanted to be and all along
1509.39,1510.59, that's right
1512.6,1517.64, i forrarder 
1517.97,1521.75, the saloon
1525.83,1527.48, this
1527.84,1529.52, i 
1533.21,1535.16, but
1535.76,1539.03, the line
1544.58,1546.86, i think that 
1547.34,1549.26, because our country
1550.43,1554.0, not been good at understanding to me the
1554.93,1556.07, for
1556.25,1561.05, with why people end up in jail which is for the most part because
1562.04,1565.85, i believe people of color have not had opportunity to work
1566.18,1573.17, and so you don't work i mean that's the other thing that i saw again in new college with the professors in our first year
1574.07,1580.1, love their work and that their love of their work gave them the confidence
1580.67,1582.11, really well
1582.11,1587.42, have work if you don't have where do you get that from and i what i have seen is
1587.42,1588.8, of people
1588.8,1593.45, no sense of worth because they've never had an opportunity to work
1593.9,1597.02, so if you don't have that than what you have
1597.47,1598.88, and i think
1601.13,1609.05, get lost in what may be what someone is done or what their past has been you met vincent vincent did twenty three years
1609.08,1610.91, second degree murder
1611.03,1613.49, and his cousin
1613.7,1615.56, one of our tree planters
1616.01,1618.17, and every year
1618.53,1623.63, she would ask me to write a letter the parole board and every year i would say
1623.72,1629.99, no way they're letting your cousin it's not going to happen tell your family he won't get out
1630.53,1636.02, one day they called me from the crogate there's a guy at the gate to shall i send them up
1636.2,1637.01, like
1637.16,1641.12, i go on war and there is mitaine met
1641.3,1643.22, and he said they went now
1643.28,1648.11, crying let me out and you wrote me the letter you can even now be
1648.2,1651.05, what your cousin let it to the belt agrees with 
1651.32,1653.78, said in my family believed
1654.65,1656.51, as how i could get out
1656.72,1658.88, but while he was in prison he
1659.87,1661.37, a pastry shop
1661.61,1666.5, what he's been doing with us i mean among other things as we
1666.65,1672.38, as make cakes and give them the seniors give them schools make give them the family
1672.56,1674.78, and talk about healing
1674.99,1679.37, that's a hen i mean he made a bunch of pies for
1679.46,1683.12, we gave them to you know the deputy that russia back and forth
1683.15,1685.07, they were just like
1685.19,1686.12, this
1686.39,1691.85, and then i saw that actually with the vegetables we started producing the vegetables
1691.88,1695.57, with all the people the prisoners of the worst name
1696.14,1699.38, it wasn't until we started bringing the vegetables and they were like
1699.41,1711.35, can't believe those dirt bags that notion grow rocklike they're not direct they did that and then and they were like what's going on out there and then when they would come out there like
1711.38,1713.48, what you doing to these real
1713.48,1716.45, it was all mewing and doing all this stuff in
1716.45,1718.85, again that confidence
1719.12,1720.92, that sharing
1722.24,1723.14, i think
1723.68,1724.88, change
1731.87,1738.32, proportionately to the place
1741.47,1744.5, oenothera
1747.56,1755.15, well what i want to say is actually i believe there is a spirit that remains
1755.15,1756.65, the spirit is
1758.18,1761.9, not just in a book do and for me
1761.96,1764.39, teaching people who i mean
1764.6,1767.36, people who read it in the garden level
1767.66,1771.74, so i can't give them a book and say learn about horticulture
1771.8,1779.63, i showed them i can help them to do it and that's what i learned a new code when susan said you want to do arraignments go do
1779.72,1781.97, to be a criminal lawyer be that
1783.29,1789.02, tom talked about towards an now an i now you know i mean i mean
1789.41,1799.49, cases have made huge changes in the wall when peter is talking about andrea i mean it was all the with the idea was this is what it is
1799.7,1804.59, with our understanding and with art with our energy we could make it better
1804.98,1807.8, i believe that that spirit is still with
1808.4,1812.06, no i haven't seen or susan
1812.6,1813.95, many years
1814.13,1816.89, i sees a my neighbor
1816.98,1820.97, but i believe it goes on and i believe that
1820.97,1822.32, something
1822.44,1828.68, should be shared with other folks and i do think that it was a good model and
1828.68,1830.69, i was very sad to see it
1832.73,1838.13, abitation and comfortable
1843.41,1850.37, and staring was teaching in one hesitating
1850.43,1853.76, a
1854.27,1856.46, people of color
1856.55,1858.56, and
1860.21,1862.76, new college man 
1864.05,1871.1, single welfare mother and being there i mean was very different being now taking a class with it some one from harvard
1871.22,1872.42, very different
1872.69,1874.43, and but
1874.52,1878.48, someone from harvard never said single welfare mother you
1879.05,1880.22, he
1880.28,1882.11, that encouraged me
1882.56,1887.42, try harder so i could go through good good good in because it was very hard for me
1887.63,1888.89, and
1889.07,1890.75, you know the other students
1891.08,1893.72, studied with me to help me
1893.9,1896.54, and so i never had a sense
1898.04,1900.56, i mean my initial
1900.62,1904.67, i couldn't do it and i would make it an i didn't long there
1905.15,1906.92, very quickly
1907.01,1910.91, you know some of the students you know like ran near and
1910.97,1913.22, jurand
1913.22,1923.87, those two for sure but i can't remember all of them but each one of them as they went on to the world and did stop you know and i would see them or know that they were doing stuff
1923.87,1925.61, make me very proud
1925.79,1927.47, because
1928.22,1933.62, were very smart and but they were smart because they worked at it because they believed in it
1933.74,1936.83, because you know they were just born that way
1936.95,1938.66, some of them were probably going that way
1938.93,1941.54, very smart in
1942.68,1946.94, trying to get more skill so that they would be better at what they were doing
1947.12,1948.08, that
1948.35,1953.3, stay with me i tried to get better by learning as much as possible
1953.3,1954.53, what i'm doing
