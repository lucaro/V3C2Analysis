290.85,291.99, years ago
292.14,303.21, years ago or five years ago probably ten years and all he would accord a white person walking down a street he wouldn't have you wouldn't have
303.42,309.42, but that means somebody who is no longer than they were good what happened to them
312.87,348.24, dedication is occurring all over the city and the way in which it unfolds varies and washington d c in the earliest cases was george to going back to the nineteen thirty portions of georgetown had a large and flourishing after american population that population was seriously diminished through policy changes that were round beautification enhancement getting rid of all getting rid of houses that were falling upon that will not well maintained
360.6,377.22, you have like a street car door or you street for indoor is dorlcote with the riots post a sodomite estimation of moabite ears were a prison occur with it was lots of property damage and where those areas were justice they were blinded they will laugh to do that
377.43,414.6, for those who are watching on the war like all this couldn't be happening on leniency besides what areas is salable or what areas are to go to hell and there be limited police presence and you know what happens in that area late nineteen eighteen there was still some drug issues that were quite significant the community which was predominantly african american community was very sad about that they would call the police and they were satisfied with the response sometimes the police would not come the even engage in their own patrols

448.77,450.3, the
450.63,483.27, we had to do so they said that as the community did become wider and wider there was a greater police presence and that the police also responded faster so they interpreted that as bare bodies their lives their community not being that important at that time or not being a priority after white residents began to come in they was more value put on the community generating safety and doing more patrols in the area so that was the take away from them

512.1,519.87, first time back to live in the city or an increase in that category as well think that bursts good
520.59,524.49, i think it gives us an opportune all of us an opportunity to grow
524.73,548.28, i think we can learn from each other each sees experiences as well i have herein encheiresin things like i appreciate the diversity i want to be able to live in an environment that has a lot of different people in and make us some people honestly believe that but certainly what we know is a plethora of stores and restaurants and you do not see a lot of heterogeneity
548.61,576.57, the scribe georgetown as a white one play the area that was historically and a lot of mantineans in it has now become this area that associated with a lot of wealth and so when you have a space like that there is also an understanding of huelgoet space and who does not the honest black person will tell you this if i go to that name hood the chances are the policeman for me
577.05,591.54, the message is clear so out and named her so there you have it i think most of the white people who come in these

614.37,617.43, that does not
617.55,629.16, we more than from the white privilege of them not been able to recognize that just because the police have treated you i suddenly
629.34,632.28, man the true same way
632.82,647.31, one of my concern would be that this city as we know what it is quinglet change and it's going to be a predominantly why and predominant wealthy and somewhat homogeneous and
647.43,649.44, what welcoming
650.37,658.53, some areas that are more recently predominantly black when i got there and i seen pronominal white and is not the issue were white as the issue
660.0,667.5, this notion that an alsacien black is wrong and so when you see me i'm trying to figure out what it is you've seen when you see me
668.85,671.88, that's what i'm that's what i'm struggling with
671.94,698.34, income and you see me you get the balloon but you cause i'm a known you when you are your unknown to me was monday six o'clock in the evening eighteen year old jason guespin's friends were a standing outside of a bank an eastern market jason is a freshman at you they weren't committing any crime by just standing there we learned a white woman called nine one one and send the guys made her feel uncomfortable
698.67,722.01, the call is a transcription released by the city i yes i want to report that there's three teenagers in the city bank on pennsylvania avenue and even that are waiting at the door to let people in but aren't doing anything inside the bank we just left but we feel like if we had taken money out we might have gotten rock here's a closer look and what happened next
722.19,773.1, now do not and not that you nothing to me that's a partisan a black body being out of place it in their own city and in a space that historically had been ainmein as the precious station of that the kind of fear that associated projected onto the bodies particularly of black on males all people of coloured sand not to come politician that often a man left in others going down you really need their help i have a servant been told about cases where centuries have called louise every minor things usually kind of small quality of life issues such as noise
773.28,795.3, or perhaps the gathering of people again don't belong in their bodies on belong in texas or there's a procession that they don't belong that pace and they see the police as mechanisms to which they think can happen i don't see african americans in minority rooms looking at the police in that way
795.3,801.18, again the police are really facetious emergency because the police are unpredictable
801.42,811.77, but while canaples while you put them in the hands of the merciless you want to see them you had lain on the ground then such a topcoat would you want
811.83,824.7, folks and the comfortable with you being here and there was law and themistocles to looting police are an extension of the powers that be
824.7,856.02, and they're all here to enforce there i did and the gender and so we say how are the poetica on they are the enforcement of gentian because of the proper tax don't get you if the hatherton of classes deathplace you a case sanguinolent times on his way to work wennerstroem

874.14,919.44, and more recently here ah but you know i think as the agency or training setup we have on an academy that deals with so many things that at the arms as with so many approaches and strategies one of the things that are implicit betraying i think that is allowed all of us to be cognisant of many things that were confined without their all tenuitatem astrogator never want to antoinette downsitting don't be too much with friandises alangala
