0.57,19.26, i was making a recipe that needed a lot of lemons so i just sent out a general mail on the neighborhood emigrated if anyone has extra loonies come get some and everyone was like overwhelmingly yes like you know commandement
19.74,27.87, let me know that just come by any time that she had so many lemons and she was like don't worry about it even if my car is not here from that home and just come on in the yard so i didn't
27.9,46.77, to do that i took a lot of lemons and so i thought i saw some movement in the house so i just wanted to knock on the door and say thank you and when i knocked on the door the woman i could see her through the window in the door she was on the phone and she was saying
46.77,63.39, no absolutely not going to open the door i had the part of the street from my house and got out of car walking and in less than half a block up walking back two women walking up the street looked up saw me coming down the street they walked out into the millstreet
63.42,67.77, walk down past a few cars until they got past me and then came back on to the sidewalk
68.43,70.77, by the time i got to the porch
70.98,111.12, i'm literally shaking because i just realize you know what they just did it is a little bit anointing the dog or on the back and just knowing that there's probably some one across the street in their house just look at thinking for the doing there were they there and i've always every single day while when i'm just out of the car out of the house just on the street some work i just think like it i don't really want to be here right now is little and comfortable neighborless for down in a couple of years now and it formed out of this need for
111.15,123.57, better communication i think on the listers you know whether it's next door the individual neighborhood whole groups that we have going there seems to be a lack of
123.57,134.79, on around the profiling that was done through these mails will profiling you hear you know you'll see it on save the inference website
134.79,155.16, american five ten medium bill bald clean shaven or beer and the first youth i think about is that sounds like me that kind of mails are they call them high crime alert messages that come across on the neighborhood less service in time the descriptions are so general and vague it just say
155.22,212.31, there's a black man or a brown skin woman you know walking slowly by my house beyond the alert for suspicious activity and i like it could be me walking to the grocery store the story concerned about it some one you know looks out the window sees a person they of color that they don't recognize and or there just you know having a bad day or their nervous about something or their other beds are whatever and they decided to call the police and or private security and then that's just not now that the potential you know the ristorante napoleon symbolising the neighborhood in the note
212.55,228.69, there had been a few neighbors that have said you know i absolutely agree with you and they bore me just don't engage the crazy that's out there but you know it's hard not to because when i see something that goes out to the entire neighborhood my first impulse
230.07,231.03, to
231.06,254.37, counter balance that if you have very few people who are posting and becoming more afraid in their heavily armed their real potential for them to get worse and harm themselves or some one else and there's no monitoring of that there is a presumption that appear posting about this that you are that you are sort of not the criminal
254.58,277.47, i don't worry i don't put when i leave in the morning to go runs on used to put my lady on but if i know i'm not parked directly in front of the house and have to walk up the block to get to my car i won't put my hoodoo my hoop in the neighborhood i don't walk even the gerrard i drive to the storm
277.62,284.73, yeah i think it absolutely has changed my my my patterns of walking i go to the park
284.85,286.53, i don't walk here
286.62,344.1, i think next door is making a real mistake in sort of their format in that there dousland they allow you to talk about crime and i think if you're talking about building community there is no section for education for family for a dialogue about how do we create a safe space for teenagers how do ye transposition teenagers to being adults and let them make mistakes without being incarcerated you hear you know can you be a little bit more specific i'm not so generic on the description can you tell us what the suspicious behaviour was why did you think this person you know was doing something in the neighborhood shouldn't be here and what you end up with is this hostility because you know another black person might respond and basically the maratta on the mail spring are you being too sensitive hypersensitive about you know what we're saying i would think estate
344.19,350.7, start by describing this suspicious behaviour what is it that seems out of line
351.81,356.43, like what's the cause for concern so you think someone's casing your house like
356.64,367.23, can you describe that versus starting with some kind of like fear based description of others a big black man and he's walking by my house i mean
367.32,373.29, every right to a canon of your house right so i would say
373.89,381.36, your neighbors of color make sure that you're not describing one of them just going about their daily actions because
381.78,383.61, were to be called
383.61,386.04, like your putting our safety
386.13,434.13, danger they just use a generic suspicious behaviour and personally i would like to know what is that suspicious behaviour because if i'm part of the neighborhood and i'm going to be looking out for suspicious behaviour i want to i want to be able to validate what you saw is important to just be aware of the fact that you making this call can bring harm to someone else so i would start their second there are more you know more and more i guess you call it guidelines to checklist you know information coming out that a lot of it some of it wantoned by the police about how to properly report you know incidentally
434.16,440.97, but what i've noticed a lot is people don't even look me in the face so if you don't look me in the face you can't even get the proper description of what i look like
441.27,445.29, that i think that lends to the generic profile
445.32,447.3, people aren't looking at people
447.33,468.66, you know they're just saying a silhouette i mean i moved here from the south and i didn't have these kinds of experiences there like to to move to such a diverse area the bay area is known to have such a wonderfully culturally and ethnically diverse community and to have these kinds of experiences
470.19,473.85, unthinkable i'm just i'm shocked i'm sad and
475.02,478.65, and i'm starting to get resentful i'm starting to think
479.19,480.6, i need to move
