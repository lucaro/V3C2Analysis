1.08,10.53, going on a run to day we're going to see how far i can run and hoping to run between four and seven miles an
11.13,13.92, little teeny bit worried
14.55,18.3, because i ran nine miles
18.99,25.38, but i want to go run for and i felt like i ran pretty strong but i ended with pretty
25.83,28.5, a pretty harsh
28.68,31.62, runners maisie never had it that bad
31.8,33.3, and as
33.33,36.33, we expected it was in my right 
37.68,46.26, going on kind of a tester it's like i've been saying these weeks are really going to be telling us to whether or not i can do the full mashona
47.01,48.21, my knee
48.42,58.47, can't really start taking the mileage that i'm going to be putting on it as quickly as i like then were definitely you have to like down grade to the half so
60.36,63.99, see how today goes i ended up taking yesterday off cause
64.11,67.14, i heard after the four mile run to
68.28,70.59, ganlesse
70.92,79.08, so kind of give us to the very ah minimal running
81.09,83.67, but be
85.44,99.15, i usually have a bit more and in sad i'm getting used to having less on but so hot that you know i know what i penstroke
103.74,119.52, it look more like a run in a day i guess so not looking good not looking at it all i ran like point one miles
120.33,129.96, and i could already tell my name is starting a up to a little bit worrying so
130.92,133.11, i'm going to need to take
133.59,140.07, another day off i'm surprised i didn't think i felt that bad after the nine mile but
140.13,146.85, apparently that wasn't the case i think this actually might be a very good sign that
147.84,150.9, my body is just
150.9,155.19, like one corner of my bodies just not ready
156.06,163.44, methink i mean i'm half way through this is where it starts getting pretty real
163.89,173.1, and i think i'm going to have to take a lot more time put in the miles on
173.1,188.43, so i've been thinking about this for a little while now i am thinking about making my own schedule i have been using the nike schedule i talked to
188.52,193.05, a friend of mine about this and she kind of had the same idea
193.11,199.77, she is the makepeace ule to prep for the half marathon
200.94,205.68, and she mentioned just being utterly worn out by it
207.06,213.96, and i don't want my schedule to do that i want my schedule to be something that feels
214.11,233.37, challenging but natural and doesn't push me in a way that i clearly can't be pushed so i'm thinking i've been thinking about this for a while now with all the travel i'm doing he busy i did how inconsistent my running has been
233.4,238.26, go ahead and call it and i'm going to shoot for the half marathon this time around
238.38,243.9, and then maybe try and figure out a way to train continue training throughout the winter
243.93,283.56, a trysting like full or something because i want to keep i want to get to a good mileage and i wanted to say consistent something i'm actually super interested in trying out is eventually maintaining a week that is three miles six miles three miles half marathon every week that to me feels like something i could do and i know it sounds hanray but if you just have one day that's a huge mileage day that something that you can typically kind of deal with and if i keep the rest of my running at a fairly low pace
283.71,294.66, then i get to have those long days for i'm just just in it and that is the day that i run so i want to get that that's my gal right now
294.78,301.74, i think i think i want to be able to do a half marathon again you know from the beginning
301.74,309.03, so interested in being able to one day run marathon but i want to do it smart and i don't want to get hurt
309.12,318.3, right now the half may thought is something i can see i'm close i did and in miller and is interesting to do nine miles and then realize
318.72,325.59, i just did for more i'm a i'm not pretty much as 
325.83,329.97, an interesting thing because if you break them up into pieces
329.97,331.92, seem so bad
333.45,349.11, for example if i broke in my head if i broke up my half methought into an eight mile an a five mile that's the thing that's not hereafter know i can do it a tiler
349.68,359.34, and now it looks like we're going to have to jump the border between eight and nine and nine and ten and ten and all the way up to thirteen
359.55,361.02, so
361.44,366.21, then i'm not upset about it actually
366.9,370.65, and i don't feel like i failed because
370.86,380.67, i feel like i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing his first training go so i think it's going to be the half his time out
