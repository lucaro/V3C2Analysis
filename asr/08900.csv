1.02,17.49, i was hoping for a colder morning the forecast called for temperatures in the mid forties i like it better when it's colder less distraction lets people less absurdity
17.85,33.42, a weather man the city's faithful supply of distraction had interfered with my morning red i taken up balls acts in search of lost time this would be my third read i don't read the modern works they desperately lack imagination
33.87,41.22, like this regime of manufactured self important identities posing to be cultivated and original
41.22,62.34, but when you look behind their dandified drapery like their modern works a dearth of imagination much like this got on my right to let the hip frames devilmecare attitude or the ostensibly urban guard fool it's all one cleverly synchronized leche a ruse to fit in
62.49,92.28, how my wonder wind is the masquerade in or does it go on forever just like this pantomime by this couple walking by notice how he is holding her hand it isn't love it is an affection it's a cover desperately clinging to each other's cold hands for the purpose of salvaging and impossible plastic identity to ignominiously participate in that theatrical scan of misdirection called young and in love
92.52,120.03, back on them in five years this place is loathsome filled to its fraudulent bram with people willing to play a role in this insipid superficial script an artificial reality kind of like that character this rakish self deluded dandy trading a posture he plundered from those who earned the right to be cavalier knows nothing about prester that is it flare and it isn't swagger
120.03,124.92, he has so laughably filled with pretence just like all the others
125.28,136.68, their jogging their coffee their healthy food it's all preformative and theater
137.01,143.85, they are terribly unaware of the folly they are for ever sustaining damfools every last one
143.88,152.07, and here she comes on time as usual i have always known from the very first time i saw her
152.1,159.87, that she was not by time stampeding through the door with her fast glamour designer shades
160.26,164.97, the selfish gorgeousness she arrested from the god who created her
165.12,169.53, the face that is probably launched a thousand suicides at the foolish hearted
169.98,176.04, he makes it quite certain to all that when she is around they don't exist
180.6,190.53, poor lady of course her black suit warns don't even think about it as she waits and patiently
190.65,196.44, apologetically tracing completely the significance of any one around her
196.56,200.4, there she goes at her phone pecking away
200.52,210.81, peck peck peck peck her allegiance to the board room is required of her elegance which i can almost guarantee she gladly offered
211.32,214.08, in exchange for the warmth of the lover's touch
214.35,216.36, for he must have been
216.81,219.21, poor soul he must be now
222.3,224.25, this should be entertaining
230.82,233.04, he
233.1,234.27, he
236.55,241.29, her usual straight coffee in hand she makes her routine first stop
242.91,246.51, quick splash of soy milk and two napkins
255.87,263.07, the photo
263.07,267.93, i can
268.29,328.77, the pack pack pack like i said or totally not my time so i only wonder when does the mass graven or does it go on forever coronation afectionate too
