515.79,516.87, for
517.14,535.56, the word the first seven years or so there was some real challenges for terry being a young man trying to do ministry in a downtown church as well established but has its traditions and its problems to try to work through it was a difficult year for terry
535.98,542.49, he had been quite in transition as terrace past retain their six or seven years i guess when i rode
543.09,544.32, and
544.5,548.67, some of the people that had left the corporation were creating problems
548.97,551.1, and really there was
551.1,553.53, then he could have done
553.95,556.65, as fascinating and very
557.16,562.68, quite the impression to see him how sponded to that and grace and in prayer
563.01,565.02, just suffering
565.92,570.81, without italian said that man quite the impression
570.87,592.62, those first years at there was a doctor in pure for tyrian for emily we expected that they would be some opposition to it is human nature i will ostracise chained whereber when his children were born and especially the first one tree and a lot of us
592.71,604.98, i went down to look at this baby boy through the window in the nursery and we were just thrill for them and terry had said all through
606.42,619.83, this was maybe a year after they were here that he wanted twelve children and he kept saying he wanted twelve children but so often he would come to preach on sunday morning with a bad cold that he had caught from
619.89,624.9, one of the babies we live very close to the man and
624.99,679.89, so we had a very close association with emily and terry we loved we loved as all the babies were coming it was a joy to see them and enjoyed them i don't really have to humanize terry johnson he is a family that does that very well he is actually an excellent father his wife and his children are retribute to their living christianity in their piety the johnson kids are great we've been able to know all of them in different periods of life therefore cotillion your kind tender juliette time of prayer began are you held court at the table there with tea and hand in rigidities of
679.89,689.4, what i can see and if the king just tremendous times and i wouldn't be the man i am to day were it not for your influence
689.4,700.5, your friendship and i thank god for you and emily i tarry to may one time after preaching on a windy known service an independent
700.92,706.23, do i don't have to worry about it being born in the
706.32,720.78, of god itself is the illustration and never forgot that i am remembered eachwhere stand and when he told me that he would partake my sermon as he could take my preparation on two different occasions
720.96,752.13, on a gas so we were so wrapped up in our conversation that we just didn't even look at the gas now indicator in that renounces on one occasion we had a man stop a sixteen lovingness big trucks sixteen welters and pick us up so to two pastors get in the cab of his sixteen wateredge next existence some cats and carries very proud of being a graduate of the university of south carolina
753.78,791.31, he thinks there's another use but as a father of two proud gang cocks we know that terry always wished he had been able to get the school in columbia i mean when i was in school we used to marvel that students at us could even read and it still seven southern california that us as the university of second choice terry does believe it or not have a sense of humor my wife actually thinks he is one of the funniest men the world's all of the seriousness of the cows all out personality it's a stick according to my wife
792.15,796.8, let me put it in context of what i think
797.82,800.16, is being used
800.94,802.2, to do
802.95,805.08, i mean any
805.08,806.28, rider
807.09,815.4, some of affluence and the other riders is an article direction and i think territet
815.4,817.68, can
818.13,821.34, everitt general causes real
822.27,825.72, he places it on
826.86,828.48, i worship
829.38,830.7, think
831.09,832.5, the
837.12,840.72, the years of the twentieth century in the first
841.08,843.39, of the century
845.31,852.63, goes on he'll be notion of the major figures that helped to keep alive
852.78,861.24, best aspects of reform worship and now doctor scott old dotard
861.51,862.68, he did 
863.01,864.3, the
864.36,874.71, worse doctor probate leading and still in leaving scholar on reform worship literally in the world he studded under
876.27,881.31, switzerland and his knowledge absolutely un
881.7,888.69, and he told me that terry was one of the most able
892.11,898.68, teaching and leading warship anywhere in the united states and doctor out teach a presence and he would
900.84,903.69, say that will be a great
904.08,905.85, contribution
905.91,911.64, nineteen for as the past will in turn under terry
911.94,914.01, prostitution church
914.49,919.29, it was a very formal and significant year for me and several 
919.68,922.35, it opportunity to
922.74,925.86, cainist at all its different facets
926.13,931.05, in teaching visiting the elderly visiting people in the hospital
931.11,932.91, session meetings
933.39,937.29, but canalisation from terror who
937.56,941.1, talk to me about all the different facets of ministries 
941.28,946.68, really provide integrate foundation as a forward to complete seminary in
947.31,951.48, are churches a pastor and one deeply indebted
951.66,954.84, independent presbyterian and particularly to terry
955.17,956.73, that labor
956.73,962.04, often ponder visions chapter four were pauses that
962.22,964.41, as to the church
965.04,967.05, the guests are people
967.56,970.53, a particularly pastors and teachers
970.89,973.59, and that's why i like to think about terry
974.1,981.93, he's been a gnome and my family my wife was a product of his ministration daughter of the church
982.47,987.15, also tarmination the pa rustchuk in america
988.71,990.93, sterility
991.2,992.52, at
994.17,998.13, given to the church a god bless you these thirty years
998.37,999.45, service
999.45,1004.37, as i mention have been a church member for
1004.55,1032.75, six years last thirty years was on the terminus had the pleasure of serving with him on the cession of seeing him how he's grown from a young man to fortement minister while you think about a faithful pastor in a church for thirty years she can't help it be impressed that the lord has blessed him and he has used the blessings of lord very faithfully
1032.87,1073.22, sufferers you have to be diligent as well as faithful you have to be hard working to stay fresh and alert to what's going on in the world around addition to be a being a wonderful pastor and a supporter of church plants and missions that have angelitos is also known in our communion and throughout the reform world as calling us back to the glories of the beauty of reformers according to scripture annihilates more than just a book in the bible but actually
1073.22,1081.23, songs to be sung as a part of our devotional life and it should be introduced in the life of the church
1081.23,1108.29, what was the reform perspective of worship most of that i would say i learned from terry directly or by his instigation he pointed me the right direction to really read that and think about it carefully and so i emigrate dead on that that i think the piece has been greatly benefited and not just the pa but many other churches your letters
1108.35,1177.11, the spheres of influence of god as granite you laugh and deep mark upon your congregation i think of independent perpetuate and i think of that church i think of you of course and think of the joy and gladness and exuberant worship that is deeply rivetted prespaterian tradition editing i ever teach on the doctrine of worship without thinking of you fontanaresi we must read the bible and preach the bible and pray the bible and sing the bible and to watch the bible in the sacrosancta themistius riding fronters of a church aperture and meaningful to me i think you a period such as the last few decades in america when we've seen so much change in worship to be reminded of what the reformers did imply they did it to see the biblical foundations of that are really important to a strength in the church in serious worship i think he's went made a really valuable contribution in that area
1177.47,1191.51, well i can't say anything but good if his contribution to the piece he is so steady and he knows the bible and he lives by the bible santerre came we have grown
1191.72,1195.98, keep on growing and so many babies have been born
1197.15,1202.49, we have been so blessed with his preaching in his ministry and his example in his teaching
1203.03,1205.73, i think he has been a great influence
1205.85,1209.72, and our church he and emily
1210.32,1213.11, a wonderful example
1213.29,1225.32, the young people on bringing up the children biblically the probably the greatest influence by way of ministries what i've already expressed to you terry is to say when you said to me
1226.22,1229.4, page the word and we pray
1231.14,1246.38, that's been my life that's been the two things to which i've been commended in my ministry tarries on sermons hallen about in his demeanour his delivery his confidence in the word
1246.74,1248.63, once
1249.02,1255.02, the place of course but one of the steps to the pulpit or way would say jesus
1255.02,1258.08, i felt that they exemplified that
1258.53,1265.01, that he was there to preach the gospel when tannis came
1265.07,1266.09, my
1266.12,1290.36, surely were here my first granddaughter was born a tarnished up at saint deposit as she was born in the nurse brought her out for to see of the first time she was brought out by church member more mary jones so i thought that was a nice concentering is because
1290.54,1299.6, from the time her avocation a batteries became grandpa
1300.11,1326.6, the next thirty years i have seen tardily raised a wonderful family a phoenician grow up go through school and a couple of men i married and now periander so is gone somewhat full cycle i think so i am glad i had to provide too to see that happen
