0.0,24.99, i like to do now is turn it over to our first presenter doctor grace won the the pleasure of knowing grace for a number of years now grace's deputy assistant director for engineering at the national science foundation she's had that role since housden prior to that gray servitors as the division director of the division of industrial innovation partnerships and nice so i knew you tharlotte have a lot to learn from grace orace
25.71,27.75, a 
27.84,62.46, to be here and thank you tony for the introduction is working so are you eating lime leetel you a very short story i shall i was thinking about i soon the way or coming here tonnere talking about the baby and so i want to i say to you this is exemplified many times many of you probably know that the transistor was the invented in antipodean and bella annette in the december of monteforte seven to the world that there is a little device literalness
62.7,88.86, at the time of that announcement aberdeen rated much excitement within a ballad or outside of ballaban today into unitee when we look back at that invention you you i am sure you all agree with me that is arguable the most impact ful technology break through in the twenty century that prodigally change in our relative to day
88.86,139.2, so what i'm saying here is is very difficult to predict the value of an ip particularly added the time of invention is really difficult even with very very highly pitiable team and so to day this and we constant talking about the value and how to re bidiane last twenty to thirty years he fatiko add the landscape of the technology there is a very clear tinopener and so i make the case even more complicated is an is convergence we're talking about is a very deep integration of ideas knowledge too and techniques and everything among the physical science the engineering the life sciences the and also frequently with also social behavior economic science
139.29,147.69, and i give you a quick tumble of that is we all know the austere founding templeton lacerating eights
147.84,188.07, look at the basic research of the phases of that and in the nineties it totally by serendipity i find application in yerger and you are no worries right now is i shall be widely surprised man was by the adopted by the market to day for the yerger and also is a shiverin for the radicals and so if you think about that is this this kind of deep convergence in the last if i take a look at that charge this is a chart from journal of rousset interface and this basically studying the us ptolomeus threaten
188.28,291.36, and so you know not she is after if you as petersen abdication of patent there is no other way they can describe the patent they will create a new coat for that i mean it's really new brethren if they can use existing codes or combination of existing code to these crepitation is circumvention and you look at this and by the way this is a log scale you can see in in the last one hundred years this converting is really going and is constantly going that we have much more combination codes of the patent this mess of lipans is going to continue going on like this is campanology is converging and the place is getting much much more connected and so how do we value it in this kind of situation and continuously and also make sure that we can really harvest ipsorum heresiarch one party is really bonification and so when we look at this is in a context of university and industry partnership is that in the last twenty or thirty years the things nonentities most of the united states research university start beating the penology transfer office in totland thirteen broking sedately about the titans for office you can see sixteen universities to seventy per cent of the total licensing income of the entire us university system into twelve and
291.39,323.7, a present of the technology transfer all his deep canteen break even i mean they didn't generate enough licensing income to break even and so i'm not saying that the transfer concept does work but coryston just said that's not the only way to collaborate with industry and we clearly as a community and as a country we need to start looking at how do we harvested our work very abundant intellectual properly and and we need to really see it value from a different perspective
324.18,332.49, and i am sure my fellow penniless gone expend on this be so the reason of this really difficult
333.09,411.0, technology transfer anology licensing and also create university industry partnership has a lot to do with the perception of the vihara and when you have different perception you have different expiation we are dear differentiation limitation of the interest make very difficult to collaborate and this sicily the reis idlers supported by national science mentation into a thousand thirteen tony i shall organize a workshop in this report the predicament i shall be from all over the country and take a look at the statutable for two days and made the conclusion here is a university and industry need to realistically with intent invasions and explore more flexible policies in management because industry tend to value the pin the short term and look at a return investment and we need to really see the short term economic benefit and if for university our mission is really knowledge creation and also the education so of course we see it from us hoping that we come harvesting longer term and so we really need to see look at this and see how we will know the i p moving forward
411.21,536.67, it was unpolished just putting together i shall be on my discussion and the oidores i shall find ovation introduced a new template for the pageant for our industry university corraterie research centers which is really a flagship platform for a university and industry to work together and join lycoperdon research agenda and i usertesen focus on prepare competitive basic research and that's why in in in addition to the traditional option which means we clarified deinapore shape of homes what i pass very traditional approach we introduce a two other options when riches open source software and another one is the public the mean operation and want to emphasise the third option here is particularly beneficial for the precipitate research when we are not into the perducere yet and not into the competitive level yet we agree that some of our sentries within the indian dusty together agreed to put the the invasions and abandoned into the public the man means published it and so in a case we don't need to worry about whom what but focusing on the result and when there we enter the stage of the technology development is close to the competitive research then we start talking about at the pigtailed perissodactyle stage to really work together so without taking too much of your time here i'm going to close it but just want to say while you the yepantcha do we are harvested i p valuing forward and were seen i palliate way and introduce new thinking is essential for our really look at the hip practice as a community and see how we actually can enable a much larger economic demanet of the intellectual capacity for the country
537.03,538.59, there
