0.36,9.33, he 
18.6,20.28, love stories
23.01,25.14, still love to get lost
25.17,26.4, a story
27.72,30.81, reading a book you're the one
31.14,35.34, in the story and giving a character their voices in their appearance
36.93,38.85, a good book
38.88,41.64, well help their enfield
44.19,45.9, with their own imagination
46.44,49.53, in a something that we don't often think about
49.92,65.1, book is actually doing work to eliminate distractions from her and doing his best to present content in a way that is beautiful and biting and makes a story the center of the reader's experience
66.33,68.13, the people love
68.28,71.31, stories so much and yet
72.0,73.71, the view reading
74.37,78.48, nature as a chore
79.59,90.99, we pick up a bible we see an incredibly daunting spread in front of us we see a ton of text each page that it takes us for ever to be able to turn a page
91.08,92.49, paper is just
92.64,101.31, so extraordinarily said you almost territory and we see very large chapter numbers burst under strange or other text
101.43,103.05, the practical
103.17,107.73, are not conducive for rich reading experience
107.73,110.88, be that the encyclopedic nature
111.03,113.07, a contemporary bibles
113.07,118.95, what's driving this idea that the biblical literature is dry and boring
119.28,134.43, should be an alternative we should be able to experience these texts in their original form as literary works of art and we should be able to sit down and lose ourselves in them what we in any good book or any classic literature
137.88,148.53, i decided to call this project biblioteca and bibliotheca is the latin word for library
149.7,153.3, obviously it is into the word bible and the word bible
153.39,157.77, from the latin word biblia which means books it's a plural word
158.07,161.61, not really until the middle age is that we start seeing
161.94,162.72, the
162.72,166.2, entire biblical library contained in one volume
167.19,169.26, and it's not until
169.5,172.59, much later that we start seeing as a common thing
172.92,174.3, we just said
174.9,176.58, a lot
176.61,181.08, a solution to separate it into several volumes
181.2,183.51, four volumes
184.29,188.34, first volume is the five books of moses and the former profits
188.43,190.98, second volume is the latter profits
191.07,195.12, third volume as the writings and in the fourth volume in the new testament
195.57,199.29, one is about the size of a modern novel
199.44,202.5, you can grab it throw in your bag and take with you
203.22,205.02, before the printing press
205.17,209.13, bible was made into these beautiful manuscripts
209.19,214.71, everything from the grafting of the paper to the mixing of the ink
215.01,224.49, to the type of hand running that they used was wholly with set apart it's in a spirit of that holy approach to the texts that i have designed
224.64,227.4, the base exclusively for use
227.43,228.81, this project
230.97,239.46, seems fitting to me because the bible was passed down to the ages of the hand written text to incorporate my own hand
239.49,243.69, sort of the tendencies in the movements of my own hand into my type face
246.51,259.74, the books we see today are just bound blue when you open the spine the pages are all still sticking straight up and you're really just bending the page around in your hand with great about a son binding is that it opens flat
259.89,267.3, and kind of ben's back when you open the book so that you can set it down and look at it without having to push back the pages with your thumbs
267.9,271.65, the translation amusing is the american standard version
271.71,282.36, the american standard version because it is relatively literal it's actually closer to the original languages and the king james version was before it and
282.63,285.57, many of our modern translations are after it
286.29,292.05, eliminate these now paths dots and i've replaced them with
292.05,294.39, equivalents like you
294.48,295.68, and does
297.54,306.06, proportions of the book are based on the measurements for the ark of the covenant which are specified in exodus one and a half cubit
306.09,310.8, by one a half cubit deep by two and a half cubit long
310.98,319.86, so i've taken that measurement to create the page and then i've taken that same unit and doubled it to make the text block
320.04,331.14, and pealing away all the added conventions like chapter numbers and burst numbers cross references and study notes the lines on the page is the story
331.23,332.34, the pauper
332.49,334.44, here towards
334.71,338.94, an enjoyable reading experience it should be elegant it should be simple
339.15,341.49, it should be pure
344.52,359.52, if this is something that your excited about and you want to see it made and you want to hold it in your hand or you want to give it to your friend or your family member then this is something that i'm asking you to contribute to
360.36,465.42, in order to make the manufacturing of this book economically feasible i have to hit a minimum number basically paying for the cost of materials and production and shipping every dollar of the minimum gold will go back into the production of the book so we're talking about five hundred sets at least four books which is two thousand books and that's a big expense and that's why the minimum is merian's why i need your help now you don't hit the minimum the way this work is i don't get any of your contributions so if this is something you want to see me this is something you want to see become a reality i'm asking you to tell your friends and your family on it that you posted that you share in my opinion a book is to be cherished a book is a precious art fact that should last you a long time that should span generations and dreamily on a give people the opportunity to read the biblical library with a fresh satisfied you
