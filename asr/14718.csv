5.01,10.53, afternoon brother at cribbage and a plague to be here with you that afternoon
10.59,27.03, a beautiful spring day i found myself panting a little bit earlier in the week about all this rain that we have been having because i don't know that i can recall a spring that it's been this wet but after remember that july where that we had a nice wet spring and then
27.12,60.87, first of july it didn't rain a drop for thirty one days so i'm sure we may have some of that you know coming along here and you know in the summer but right now i'm sure it's nice to see the rain and to see them the earth can come back to life with the beauty of the trees and blossoming and all of those lovely different colors that letter showing heads was heartened to day is the first day of spring the first full day of spring a false first of me thought the first day on the sacred calendar so fourteen days from last evening will be keeping the past over here
62.01,95.28, years ago this spring we were faced with the amazing circumstances though that are under twenty five or did not experience this in the same way that the older you know a couple of generations in the church did at that time but for us it was an extremely upsetting period of time never forget it sermon that i heard roughly this time ever in the spring of nineteen ninety five where a church pastor at that time said that i'll never forget this brethren you have choice to make
96.06,133.44, that was that was the beginning of the message brethren you have choice to make and and we did and we executed those choices over a period in some cases the weeks months and some even years but we all had choices that we made and that we executed and as we all know about choices there's always consequences always consequences with choice whether they be good or bad there is always consequences and we are a product of those choices as the like to speak about this afternoon i could take a look in the time that i have the afternoon on choice
133.83,210.0, and the choice in the context of how that relates to preparation for the path over that will keep him fourteen days from last evening that start in dorothy like the introduce this this point and hopefully the point of my sermon swept sermon here this afternoon with three verses in deuteronomy thirty setting and duroy thirty is that as all the children of israel on the east side of the jordan river modes the hundred and twenty years old his right at the end of his life there is the preparation for succession in leadership from moses to joshua the preparation of cross the jordan and go into the promised land you know as the children of israel have been been promised it at that time and prior to that is when the words here in due romanticists and rome thirty bursten and twenty i'm reading from a new king james version and is gritty and good
210.33,231.06, and evil get to equations there and both those equations are uplift and good death never down please to birnie i call heaven and earth as witnesses to day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life
231.18,258.9, the life that's god's wish for it that would gods gods urging of the children of israel at that time the life and i believe that that applies to us in twenty fifteen and the two spring of this year shoes like that that what is that before us continuing with with that that both you nor descendants may live first twenty that you may love the lord
258.99,284.61, that you may obey his voice and that you may cling to him for he is your life and the length of your days and that you may dwell in the land which the lord sware to your fathers to abraham i the contact give them will quick in that i think you can look at he breathed the roster of the faithful and you can see those individuals there are all the product of choice
284.88,316.62, quickly what is the say about abraham that was mentioned here abraham believed god that would the choice that would the choice that he made and executed and the result of that with what and it was counted to him as righteousness there all the individuals better mentioned there and hebrews eleven and the scores and hundreds of others that were aware of in the pages of the bible made choices were told here in these first shoes like let's look at some choice if we were less turn back to janet's tree
316.89,384.96, first recorded choice where there are consequences less did now the housewall and made choice about naming the critters in and so he did but that that was the different kind of a choice that was a character choice here's one ingenuity that involved the choice relating to character i just backing up let me read to you genitors nine kidney were introduced to those opposite again out of the ground the lord god made every tree grow that pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life with also in the midst of the garden the tree of the knowledge of good and evil i want to change the phraseology on that last expression to try to at least he does for me to enhance the significance of that rather than saying the tree of the knowledge and then to say that there is the settled
385.02,390.36, and the tree of the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil
390.39,415.2, the same thing pacifically we have the knowledge we can have a go choice but having the knowledge of good we can make make a choice where we become knowledgeable of evil that's what that birth that what were introduced here in two nine the whole of genesis chapter three we know the story serpent lies to mother eve
415.53,429.78, no record of whether or not mother even ever encountered a lie in her life before but she made a choice she can set adam get the hole that talking snake bothered me she didn't do that
429.87,434.19, she chose to believe the serpent
434.37,474.42, thankful i've never encountered a you know a talking snake i've had my encounters with copperheads and rattlesnakes but never never one of them that talked at me her talk to me but the serpent tell her a lie and she believes it the serpent basically cause her to doubt god and causes her to make another choice first of all she believed the serpent then she believed that it's going to be okay if she takes of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and of the knowledge of bean so she does adam then followed on with with his choice what is he do he could have stood up and said i'm not doing that
474.51,484.59, i'm not going to make that to it that's wrong god told us to not partake of that tree but he did the same thing he made a choice and he executed it
485.7,490.8, of a sudden there her eyes are open they become aware that their naked
491.1,504.24, hide themselves from god god walking in the garden in the cool of the day doesn't say eve where you he he asked adam adam where are you adam said in a word where were hiding
504.48,528.27, did you did you take that tree adam basically says two things the interesting it was that woman that you gave me we played the blame game here i want to try that escaped you know myself here a little bit but it's that woman that you gave me so i'm kind of blaming you a little bit but i'm really passibus to mother eve
528.63,550.95, gottlieb what did she say she didn't say was that i hesitate snake you know and so she passed in the the buck were trying to pass the buck in the blame too for her choice to the snake find it interesting that god then addressed his theme in the reverse order starts with the snake
551.07,612.84, all you know describes the punishment there they need goes to eve he talked about what's going to happen to her difficulties with bearing children things like that being mythically you know in relationship with your husband may be in a different way than what had been in the past don't know about that and finally with that thing that i find really interesting instead become like one of us to know good and evil all of sudden they knew e book the tent and now lest he put out his hand and all to take of the tree of life and live for ever you know that that that with the restriction there then there is no more there's no more access to the the the garden their banished from the garden at that point last words of genesis twenty fourth that so he that is god drove out the man and he placed carbonates of even with the flaming sword that turned every wine
612.96,629.01, and that career caribbean responsibility was to guard the tree of life to all of a sudden there's no access to the tree of life any more i find it interesting that there was no prohibition prior to this event about the tree of life
629.25,645.39, nothing that stairway from both of those trades but just don't partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and of the knowledge of books but the tree of life was available it was there in the garden it was no restriction against that its recorded that i know of
645.51,650.49, interesting thing here is this no opportunity for repentance
650.85,669.3, see any record of anybody saying i'm sorry i wish i had a done that can we have the red here you know can this be remedied it's over you it's done at this point you're banished the garden in that center access to those to the tree of life is closed
669.39,710.01, and there is no repentance available have at that time they couldn't reverse their choice and if he that the way that it is with choice sometimes that some kinds the one to make have life long consequences and we've all seen that and with their friends and family members those people that we know well we see some one faced with the choice sometimes they make a tremendous choice and they benefit for the rest of of their lives or we see the blasting the benefits to come from that choice other times we see a choice at a young age that charts the direction for that individual life for the rest of their life that the way it is with choice
710.1,737.67, two white that god's direction to us one thing i was struck by in reading about about this topic is the cup of verses and john in this time of the year the gospel of john is his you know it's a specially powerful to me in with with the just the way that the poorer the events you know 
737.88,745.5, that time but the very powerful birth like the focus on this point in the choice the chief of christ made
745.62,753.33, struck by this in the two little birds that our john tinagon timbers as seventeen and eighteen
753.54,760.32, christ therefore my father love me because i lay down my life that i may take it again
761.01,771.69, choice there no one takes them from me in birthday tea no one takes it from chescheela it down of myself
771.69,774.03, then i made a choice
774.03,775.32, that
776.37,785.34, not that the hat the god being truth straws to see who was going to be the sacrifice that wasn't the way that it would stand
785.67,796.23, man at all in any way to emigrate the choices that were made the plan of god that recorded forth that it existed before the foundation of the world
796.35,799.56, an incredible expense of time
800.52,843.06, take it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down i have power to take it again this command i received from my father to later and hannah and john and chapter fifteen let me just read this worth to you the memory birds for for many of its greater love has no one than this than the lay down one's life for its friends that's jest christ summation of the significance appetite in shooting to lay down his life for the thin oval and all people for all time no greater love you know exists than this according to the jesuit
844.02,849.27, another choice and this one is is one that we all face
849.36,871.17, take a look at some very well known verses actually two of them and matthew ix two of them in laconic i can read him to you or your welcome to turn there there with me we've got the choice of what our primary focus should be with our life is our primary focus going to be on the physical or is their primary focus going to be on the spiritual
871.56,911.64, that's what it comes down to that the binary solution tetter just two choices there there's not three or fifteen or whatever other number it doesn't where is your primary focus going to be which of those two areas will it be matthew six twenty five matthew six twenty five therefore i say to you do not worry about your life an we're talking about life again going back to to do to romette but what what kind of life finical or spiritual will say what you'll eat what you'll drink nor about your body what you put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
911.73,915.0, a minute we need all of those things to exist
915.66,944.88, we need food on a regular basis or we're going to die you know we have the need for drink we have the need for clothing you know we have our finical needs to perpetuate our physician secondary
945.27,952.8, over time we realize that the physical is temporal and then we all have a certain amount of time and then we die
953.13,972.9, the spiritual goal and the spiritual accomplishment of god's plan of bringing many sons to glory in eternal life no end to that but we have that choice that we that each of its you know faith is on a daily basis what will my primary focus b to day
973.38,975.21, beyond the physical things
975.21,1001.61, let be that i've got physical things that i have to do is all of you have you know have we have our job we ever responsibilities you know and whatever it is that we encountered but where will my primary focus the physical over a bestial were given the answer to this question down a few verses manufactory three now the other memory burst here's what were encouraged to do but seek first
1002.27,1038.18, kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall you shall be added to you it's not the only but it seek first and so a priority camiseta lishe their fort where were told to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then we worry about some of these other things and by the way god knows what we need and will provide what we need and that that's that's the priorities came that were encouraged to unto to have in our lives to birchington six for it the seven and eight
1038.3,1043.73, birds and these are power to me these are powerful verses glaciation
1043.85,1052.76, not be deceived we could also say may be in a more vernacular don't kid yourself don't kid yourself god is not mocked
1052.82,1080.48, goin to fool god and that god is not mocked for whatever a man does he shall also reap that's what that's where the consequences come in what we sow the choices that we make are we're going to recompenses from those choices finishing and birthdays to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption our life in its over from the standpoint of physical existence
1081.65,1084.59, he who rose to the spirit
1084.98,1093.17, chosen spiritual life his shooting life will have the spirit reap everlasting life
1093.26,1094.64, our choice
1095.06,1096.47, our choice
1096.5,1105.74, can tell us you ought to choose this you ought to do that but when the rubber hit the road it's my choice it sure choice
1106.04,1116.99, our choice and do we fully have we fully considered the consequences of those choices and no action in terms of what we expect to reap from that
1117.53,1133.7, like the wind little bit of time and in john six john thick this is red often spread every time during this time of the year passed over in one form or another i believe its longest chapter in the new testament
1133.97,1142.91, no please let me know which one is that i'm not aware of one that's got more birds than you know then john sick at first
1143.09,1149.36, like to work my way through the excerpts in john thick
1149.51,1156.8, toward a conclusion as to the recoinage after the verses took place
1157.22,1165.08, to read these birds thinking about oka who made what choice and we're going to be that here in just a minute
1165.14,1175.22, and basically title this point the bread of life and the choices of the devices the bread of life and the choices of cicester birds thirty three
1175.58,1182.6, for the bread of god is he who comes down from heaven and give life to the world
1183.71,1226.76, i raspul leave its spiritual comes down from heaven and give life to the world of to give finical life too in creation but he's talking about spiritual things in john six dropped down to thirty five plasencia the tender them i am the bread of life and we have that symbol as the bread and life the connection in other places bread here and the man in the old testament where god miraculously sustained the children of israel up to let that period of time in endureth where that that they were they were on the verge of a cross in the jordan and going into the promised land at which point that the man at that
1226.94,1232.22, after they got into the land that you know the man he stopped stopped becoming available
1233.06,1265.91, theories i am the bread of life comes to michal never hunger and he who believed in machell never thirst is not speaking physically speaking spiritually because we all get hungry and we all have this but he's talking about spiritual he's talking spiritual issuing spiritual terminology and trying to make and making it spiritual point first forty and this is the will of him who sent me that every one who sees the sun and believed in him may have everlasting life
1266.33,1270.02, tillie spiritual life
1270.08,1276.5, in another way of things those by those to berlin
1276.86,1280.13, and i will raise him up at the last day
1280.85,1283.1, him up out
1283.46,1308.0, to us who have god holy spirit either we will come up out of the grave at the last trump and we will be spirit and we will live free eternity or if we're alive and remain when chief's christ returns then will be changed as the apotheosis for we changed in the twinkling of an eye in the blank of the nine and we will be spirit we will change from finical to spiritual in an instant
1312.29,1323.96, most assuredly i say you he who believed in me hath everlasting life and there's more to believe than just an acknowledgment
1324.11,1330.17, it may start with belief but it is a way of life it is the collection of choices
1330.56,1354.92, the collection of choice for chester i am the bread of life by chiefs cry life and his cries we have the opportunity for forgiveness that can give us ultimately eternalize fifty one i am the living bread which came down from heaven manawai
1355.1,1361.37, read this he heareth i am the living bread which came down from heaven to come
1361.61,1368.75, if any one eat the bits bread he will live for ever and the brand that i shall give it my flesh
1368.81,1370.91, sacrifice to his life
1371.24,1407.69, the beating that he endured and the punished the brutality that he endured as part of that sacrifice which i shall give for the life of the world it three then shifted the most assuredly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you can were pointing to the people are fixin to make a choice here in a few verses what they're going to be fifty four who whoever eats my plain drinks my blood had eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day
1407.84,1411.35, you look at this physically only it's confusing
1411.35,1435.65, obviously chief cries to speaking in terms of spiritual principles he is not talking about cannibalism here he's talking about spiritual principle the partaking of the bread of life in that sense that is in our commitment to to choose and are choice to live god's way of life and spent we can for as long as we can and as long as we live
1437.3,1474.83, there are sixty three it is the spirit which gives life the flesh profits nothing priority again the word that i speak to you are spirit and they are life sixty five and he said therefore i said to you that no one can come to me i let it be granted to him by my father and we see in john six the eloquent treatment of the reciprocity of the father and of censoris in interacting with human beings is forth calling and of the access that we have by jesus christ for traces christ to the father
1477.86,1487.46, and here we go with the conclusion from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more
1487.73,1490.67, not choose life
1491.18,1492.47, they choose
1494.51,1500.93, the different focus they didn't get it they didn't comprehend what with the
1501.53,1518.69, they chose another way they did not choose life what about the twelfth sixty seven ten chiefs of the tender the twelfth geometrical it in or in the group at this time do you all till one togo way
1519.89,1524.21, choice it's what he thinks what are you guys goin to do
1524.9,1526.82, he
1526.85,1536.15, and peter you know with his bowl personality and he answered as in sixty eight lord to whom shall we go
1536.18,1541.7, who where will we go to whom shall we go you have the word of you turn a life
1542.24,1544.4, and peter recognized that
1545.42,1550.52, he did too then we read to you john fourteen verses
1550.91,1555.68, to add to this he hated to him i am the way
1555.74,1558.17, truth and life
1559.52,1564.17, that's what the eleven understood they got that point
1564.56,1570.35, the the other disciples that walked no more with him miss the point they made a different choice
1571.01,1589.88, i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me and we have that we put that together back up there with them with birth sixty five with you that the relationship of christ and the father and in dealing with with with people that they choose to call
1593.78,1601.7, the things that i like to think about at this time of the year is to go back and to review some of the baptism of commitment
1601.91,1632.45, each other as made that are baptized in whatever time that we were in one of those most likely if when you were being advised in conception one went through the birthstone for team with you and i always like to do that at this time of the year because he began at the bout choice and were faced with choice here and what what is our focus going to be what is my focus going to be the stake a look at look fourteen
1632.48,1633.47, he
1641.66,1642.8, he
1644.03,1644.78, he
1644.84,1648.89, the birth twenty six look fourteen first twenty six
1649.4,1651.74, any one comes to me
1652.22,1664.13, he is quiet and does not hate his father mother wife children brothers sisters get and his own life also he can't be my disciple
1664.97,1667.13, is the primary focus
1667.73,1695.93, schofield reference by heaven interesting comment about that we've heard this for in a variety of different ways over the years but i like the way that the reference is cooler by able addresses that particular issue about about hate it says that in in a marginal notations all terms which define the emotions or affections are comparative their comparative we've heard it explained love less by comparison
1696.47,1706.79, that school field is saying the same thing with just a different choice of words were not told to hate because elsewhere were told that hate in the unequivalent to murder
1706.97,1728.48, so jesus christ is not self contradictory here is not telling us here that that were that but he sang that were to love left by comparison it the choice in my going to love my parents more than i love chieftian the father and any going to let that influence my commitment or not it's my choice
1729.29,1735.47, my choice what about the rest of my family what about my wife my children my sister
1736.01,1738.23, here by my own life
1738.41,1748.1, it comes to that and my willing to make that choice to where that i would choose the eternal life or for my physical life if it comes to that
1748.37,1750.05, it's our choice
1750.62,1761.78, what important each of us individually it our choice let me read to you matthew nineteen first twenty nine at the companion to live and the men move on matthew nineteen birth twenty nine
1761.96,1770.99, also the words of jesus quite the every one who had left haworth sisters father mother wife children or lands for my name than
1771.26,1777.89, a choice about priority shall receive a hundred fold and inherit eternal life
1778.1,1781.67, the consequence of the right choice
1781.7,1797.45, the consequence in chief of christ's words of differentiating between the spiritual and the physical when it comes to focus and making the choice the right choice to choose life in that sense to choose life eternal
1805.82,1822.71, the things that it's really been on my mind recently is the next point a choice to be separate the choice to be separate you know many of us i have made we have individual here in this concatenation the bambatse for well over fifty years
1823.07,1830.39, made choice many decades ago entered faithful in that sense to those choices
1830.63,1853.46, quite a group of young people in this congregation that are in transition you know in about three year period of time we've got got a really fine group of young people a remarkable group of young people that are making the transition from being in a household with a family to stretching their wings and moving out on their own they have choice to make
1853.94,1859.4, no longer going to be mom dad's choice it's going to be my choice
1859.67,1866.63, not going to be mom and dad telling me that you need to do this or don't do that it's their choice
1867.62,1873.98, faced with the transition in terms of the freedom to act to make the choice
1874.13,1878.69, well as the accountability for the results of the choice
1879.53,1881.42, when at your choice
1881.63,1900.26, and you make that choice then you reap what you thought hopefully you reap blushing if you make the wrong choice do you not going to read blooding you're going to reap consequences of wrong choice and we've all been there we've all done that were still doing that
1900.35,1908.72, all have choice that we make good bad or ugly and we all have to deal with the consequences of those choices
1908.81,1912.35, to young people i'd like to primarily
1912.35,1919.79, address this to you but it applies to every one of us in this room that is that is concerned about choice
1919.82,1929.09, spiritual prophetical let's read for birth to that effect and corinthians and corinthian thick fourteenth seventeenth
1932.57,1935.9, the corinthian this
1935.99,1945.86, for the word of the apostle paul in a second letter to the current and do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers
1946.43,1949.7, a dent mewards
1950.72,1962.42, come right out and make the position statement don't be unequally yoked together with unbelievers and continuing for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness
1962.81,1968.42, what communion hath light with darkness and he thought to painting
1968.45,1976.67, with words you know this picture of wife and darkness you know a belief and unbelief
1977.69,1992.63, with light with thee in the gospel of charm light and life and that the symbolism of chiefs christ as the light of the world the gives all of its life spiritually continuing in fifteen
1992.75,2001.66, and he goes through the series of opposite what accord or concord had christ with belial
2002.98,2006.28, part had the believer with an unbeliever
2007.33,2012.37, sixteen and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols
2013.06,2016.09, we've all got to answer those questions
2016.3,2025.15, all got to faith the choices that we make and the results of those toys for you are the temple of the living god
2025.27,2053.59, it god i then i will dwell in them and walk among them i will be their god and they shall be my people you pooping a couple of birth is not a leviticus twenty six same principle your fix and come into the faith the promised land you you've got choices to make as you interact and how you interact with the inhabitants of that land but this is the apostasy he he's quoting from that
2054.4,2082.87, the situation that god wealth in us too by the power of his holy spirit elsewhere says her chiefest christ is dwelling in us and that is the holy spirit that that we who are baptized him he is living in a weather the temple of god so we need to be careful with their choices because we are the temple of god if we however of god totally spirit
2084.4,2087.13, cole make
2087.19,2089.95, concluding in birth seventeen
