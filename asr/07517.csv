37.05,46.29, he
46.38,49.23, there my teenage years i was
49.41,57.96, searching quiet extensively and regards to spirituality and also religion and three that i found yoga
58.2,67.92, and i think what attracted me to look further into the actual practice of yoga is the fact that its experiential
67.98,69.93, you have to go
69.93,85.71, through a process to understand my parents they raise me quite well telling me okay live like this in the end this do these things
85.95,93.63, when i started to practise yoga there was a sense of connection on the inside where i really wanted to be a good person
94.62,104.61, i felt motivated to transform myself or move myself higher up
106.05,109.32, and the moment i came on my mad
109.53,133.2, like i was home i really felt like this is a space where i can really be me and really connect to this internal part of myself i felt at home within myself i felt at home with even the things i was struggling with and that was huge for me in the beginning when i started the practice and one reason why i continued to do this practice
135.42,161.31, then they started a practice we learned many many atinas we go through this process of the being taught and we did ourselves through a sequence of postures and it looks to be on the outside very physical or to be representative of something very external
161.34,170.64, but underlying through all of that was really moving us within these optimists the breath is the focal point
170.67,178.83, sense of concentration and through the astonished the act of of performing the asinus
178.83,184.02, internally aligned i feel like personally this is what really moves
184.2,198.84, action of the optimists is what breath life into the open it's like a form of expressing this internal aspect are of ourselves to the outside or also
199.2,206.64, just using the asset feel on the inside and it's a marriage of both
208.05,209.55, he
209.97,213.6, he
213.78,214.98, he
217.02,221.52, the transformative process really comes through with
221.76,232.68, this connection so the change really came from within i think that was what was huge for me instead of these rules i was trying to follow on the outside
232.68,265.44, feel like i wanted to fit in to want to fit in to one to attain validation or even approval from my parents when i started a practice really came from the inside there was a connection from the inside where there was a motivation to be better to be more aware to live on a higher level to connect with people more authentically because i was connecting on the inside because i was aware of what was happening inside of me
265.44,277.74, more motivation to lead my life externally connecting on a higher level that internal connection is really what transforms us because we start to
277.77,284.19, see the importance of just shedding the layers that kind of his hold us back or cover up
284.22,285.72, we really are
286.59,303.0, i fell from a high to forty feet where rockland for two years i was in bed in one way was very dramatic and another watervliet it gave me the direction for my life because i guess when
303.27,311.01, the most important things that you loved the most which is movement which was movement for me is taken away from you
311.04,322.68, become even more passionate you feel like this is what do you want more than anything in the world
331.05,373.41, i started reading up a lot of you i realize that there's more to this body there that is the mind boycott is this connection to god at felt like it was all these things that took me in the direction of yoga and and eventually give me back my poor gave me back my power to move to express you know i feel like a mixed extremely grateful because for the accident and also for finding you go because of it 
373.5,388.53, have a lord of passion for movement i guess it comes from the fact that it's not something in for granted and it is the younger practice that to me really really really helps me to be able to move every day and which is why
388.62,398.37, my prayer is how expressed devotion to god it's how i express emotion to myself it's how i feel a line
398.4,402.45, given me wings i can dance i can walk i can run it
402.6,484.5, thanks to my bellacic because the days that i don't do it i mean the day that i can't really walk that well it's the practice that just keeps it all going to end tenterfore dance is freedom i don't like to move too much from my mind when i dance you guys is my grounding and i feel only freedom and that's why i feel like the two then complement each other for meteorological i think for me relationships where the relationships with my bornation ships with my family or relationship with my friends i think your gurraymi this
484.92,499.26, though physically as space is of course is challenging by i find that the connections with people and relationships are like apelike myoptic giving me dreaming for that which is the real yegor me

528.3,568.44, communications and people you can blame it on somebody else but i think when you start practicing your gay or using you become so much more awake doesn't mean you become enlighten but you can see your own self the other person becomes a middle for you to see staff in your own self and that's where i feel the delirations in because you become so much more present to watching all the bottoms of your own mind
568.59,579.87, when i first started with to go was really an individual process i was feeling that i needed to heal myself in some way or understand
580.08,604.95, myself through my body
605.22,618.27, and this was a practice that was really just about being on my mat by myself of course i went to classes and had a teacher but the practice was very individual
618.36,648.36, and as i have moved along in my overturned became more about connecting with other people i think what to us now that the word gilgames union or comes from the same root as as to which is another way of hunting and waitstill individual practice do you practise on your own you do not practice with other people but to interact with other people held low to develop our our own nogaras by featuring potato malabon how
648.54,685.47, opening the hardest possible in your individual practice and them that really help him with our relationship and then on the other hand on the other side lest had melted with my practice of opening the heart as well so i think it was an influence that the bed more on both sides so my practice at influence in our relationship and our relationship the big influence on my on my practice my physical practice in my mind spiritualisation practice meditation practice for example

705.96,722.28, in terms of being in a relationship with another and this for me is really a wonderful experience it allows us both i think to really commit in a way that much depends

1762.86,1788.9, absolutely not think about anything else that whatsoever in that moment when i hope pray practice with the with the same dedication that i would in yoga but the purposes of very different
1789.29,1835.88, all i think about how lovely know how can i get my body into the perfect shape with the right angles so it has the most impact on whoever will be watching me i'm i'm trying to create a beautiful picture with the secrets of movement and i intend to take the audience on a journey but when i practice it's nothing like that i'm not doing it for any one my creative mind is turned all the way down i disallow the steps and the breath that i need to take in order to to stack the bones in the muscles of toechter and to lie everything up so that every single part of me at attention and not just the parts that look good
1836.84,1843.35, and i think that to me that's the ultimate relaxation you know there is no pressure to look
1843.38,1942.92, only way that i should get my hat up this high as if i can do that in exact alignment that i'm being prescribed it goes almost as in completely against why i want to do is an arlington i practise i simply have no choice to leave my ego at the door because if i take it with me i am not doing yoglan to do is slip pretty in certain positions while in the classroom and you wasting my time

2067.39,2139.6, being is such a powerful technique because they are in is in the breath work are working on such a deep level from from inside from your inner core is has such a purifying and cleansing effect so obviously the work the work happens for inside and then everything else on the outside changes a lot of people that practice can delineate are often people often say to them will you know you look so good your worrying you know your radiating a glowing and we all know how infectious it is when you know when we fall happy we want to dispread that happiness to everyone that surrounders servitor me is is this is what can delineate beyond beyond the around the actual beyond the actual practice beyond you know the breathing and the ithacan arm and the chanting the after effects the energy that flowing through you this is the large

2223.33,2233.65, so i never had such an intimate experience with another person of never had an intestine of experience with a neat
2234.04,2432.07, the thing outside of myself is the deepest kind of listening to what i'm doing essentially it's not just a physical experience it really is like making love to life the theatre to all aspects of life that so precious and so beautiful which is why i'm so passionate about teaching as if i could help anybody to find this kind of connection the love of life the love of the university themselves if ever amended something else i feel like there's a language that is being spoken all the time that is the language of the universe and then it can be divided into different aspects of nature and each one you can listen to on its own and you can listen to the preconisation of all of them and so it's mention where i am in the world the conversation of the surrounding nature is always different and he always moved in a different way i have practised so many different types and now my practices definitely influenced by all of them that one of the things that i loved the most about where i am at right now is that i can see how much faster i can drop the the self critical voice that may in the past stopped me doing from wanting to try something new or would have made it harder for me to want to try something new because i was would be more afraid of messing up let's say so my practice changed in this way actually from from movement that perhaps i had learned or practice for many years was regimented in one way or another that i in a way that i had been told that you are supposed to move from this post of this post to this post this post why was calculating when a donation in my mind and i then changed to a spontaneous movement it would come before the thought and the sequence and folds now and often i don't even know what i did on one side and if we trust for a moment and just to see trust enough to to say okay well maybe i will mess at maybe i won't know what to do on the other side but let's just see and who cares if i who cares if i don't know what i did on the other side then we start to become a little bit more pliable
2432.13,2459.67, and we start to give back the trust to ourselves because one of the reasons why we always calculate every moment is because we're afraid of messing up but if we can give up this spear of making a mistake then we give the trust back to ourselves and then we can really let ourselves unfold
