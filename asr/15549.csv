182.01,185.16, school and they
185.88,193.32, the catholic church is views are considered outdated or antiquated or evil and some were another and
194.22,201.27, the knowledge that even though you know catholics are the minority you know in the public at school were not fighting a losing battle
202.53,204.9, we have won the battle it's just

283.59,286.8, and just as the first really
287.49,291.03, just kind of sums up what it is to be a catholic and to this world you know it's
291.15,294.99, it's up thirsting to be afraid of right there are
