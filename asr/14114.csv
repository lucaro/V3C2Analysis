10.02,50.55, i elementargeist yet butterflies when i go out and play shoots not really nervously said its excitement is the collective energy of everybody coming together the band the audience everybody in heifer thing up to a different place the audience conveys things to me and and i feel it back to them then they feared back to him
50.82,61.44, it's absolutely electric and we all walk away from the shell feeling that we've been through something together
62.31,71.19, to me that's what a life show is about you find a passion in life and that's what you do
73.74,138.93, i just fell in love with the sound of the horn i fell in love with the simplicity of the instrument it just seemed like the path that he was already determined for me it seemed like where i needed to go i mean i went to the eastern school of music and i learned how to play classical music i was signed as a song writer to margaret on her chapel everybody who was anybody was on a label for play was on her and george du bon james kekuanoa rotted with rod steward for for a few years and play with lots of different artists like joe corker and i turned with shanteney with war think it's comin on close to close to twenty years said i've been doing this and so grateful for that i'm proud of that i'm proud of
139.05,141.21, to show up and
141.24,151.17, i think there is no substitute for hard work
151.56,157.83, an think a sad piece of music is assad emotional piece of music no matter
158.16,159.24, listening
159.27,178.29, that whereas a an uplifting happy peace music and on the most simplistic level is going to reach people and touch people that way no matter who you are or where you're from what language you speak what color you are i'll give you an example when i first moved to los angeles
179.97,184.77, the only gigs that i could get her money and pay my rent

187.29,190.17, were along and et la
190.62,191.64, and
191.76,195.96, i would be the only white person in a latin club
196.44,198.27, and i never had an issue
198.45,210.06, and was accepted and i as you know love in that respect i think music is the universal language
215.97,223.98, the music is such a beautiful abstract way of expressing yourself i like to think about not
224.82,226.5, and
226.74,276.75, phrases and things like that like the tools like a tool like a mechanic approach like the notes are individual words in a sentence and use the sentences of phrase and a phrase you used to make a paragraph which which might be a song and in the song goes on to be a part of a record which could be the bookstall
278.94,281.37, let's just take for example
281.61,283.35, okay
283.71,284.58, and
285.66,288.81, this is an example of
289.83,294.15, song that came about because of a life experience

297.93,299.25, paul brown
299.37,307.83, and repute and he plays a keyboard with david sanborn and right in the middle of the creative process my daughter was born
307.83,309.3, seven weeks early
309.36,320.52, was absolutely a shock and an was in and i see you so she was in an incubator cause she was having a lot of trouble she was four pounds and i walked in and
321.48,326.79, paul and ricky were sitting there and they must have seen something in my face because she's
327.18,333.18, on for him let's write us all and we started working on it and
333.33,338.31, god bless the man he sat down and played the beautiful simple little thing
338.64,340.98, and
341.64,345.27, it played through it and the first time i played through it
345.36,366.09, beautiful melody came out and i was just picturing closed my eyes and picture her land there and what had just happened is okay she's just born and he's onywhere and all that stuff and we don't know you don't know what's going to happen when somebody's four pounds and the seeker and the nurse had said to me

386.58,387.75, and
387.9,391.17, what i was picturing when i started to play
398.91,408.12, when i get away from music for any length of time i get on canter on now i really get on centred and they feel like there's a part of me that's not
408.33,424.95, not connected you know so then i come back and pick up this piece of plumbing and put some music honest our plane along tayoga i always come out it's like meditation and now it really is really is
428.37,462.0, think about music as as the landscape of our life i mean there are certain tunes that come on for everybody were you connected to some memory some beautiful memory and all of a sudden doesn't matter where you are you're taken out of that and you're all the sudden in that beautiful place and i think that's the key comes from the fees you once once i can let it to relax to that meditation a point of being in contact with
462.0,467.25, whatever is in the air at that moment
467.31,486.87, a compound benoit does come
