1.56,20.7, aeternitatis communicating a communication of small pox of a secret of power
20.79,40.23, yet the case by words lithesomeness in recanati the broadest aspects of communication much work has recently been done to clarify theories and make them work
40.65,56.43, we are entering my well be characterized as an era of communication this film will touch in the most elementary way some aspects of the subject that are daily concern to all of us
57.06,64.56, lunnon's diagram by which almost any communication process can be schematically represented
65.22,71.16, information source selects the desired message out of a set of possible messages
71.52,75.27, transmitter changes the message into the signal
75.36,79.23, he sent over the communications channel to the receiver
79.65,84.48, i decoded back into the message and delivered to the destination
85.2,88.5, every such system contains nice
88.83,98.7, a term used in the communications field to designate any outside force which acts on the transmitted signals to variation the original
99.3,103.65, this usage noise does not necessarily mean sound
104.13,112.65, as a form of communication where the word is a signal a printed page the transmitter light the channel the eye the receiver
113.43,117.15, he sounds an act does noise
117.33,137.55, with the message but in some situations like reading on a train where the sound level is normally high it is not the sound that it appears with the communication process as much as the motion and the unpredictable quality of the light source quality of light and motion then becomes no
139.56,167.91, in radio nice could be static and television noises of from the distortion of the picture through transmitting our receiving in a typewriting and noise so could be in the quality of the ribbon are the key and we are all familiar with the carbon copies to keep getting progressively worse if anything aconitine so as to bury it in an unpredictable and undesirable way in the communication system
168.12,169.44, is not
171.36,179.88, consider telegraphy in terms of the same diagram it will use a dark stock broker's office as the information source
180.15,189.21, the angels that brokers offices the destination there may exist at the information source just to possible messages
189.42,191.16, self
191.37,201.3, to the message celeste then called the telegraphic transmitter and sent over the channel in electrical impulse signals
201.36,205.14, and by the receiver back into the message cell
205.17,207.3, delivered to the destination
208.5,212.73, of course is there this time acting electrically
212.97,218.58, could i start the signal in such a way as to change fell into self
219.0,223.41, as their only two possible messages by and sell
223.8,229.83, sufficient redundancy in the spelling of the words but even if it did read self
230.28,232.8, formation would still be clear
233.88,238.83, the example has nothing to do with the stuff brokers office of to day
238.89,241.86, of all organized communication
241.86,245.7, information is perhaps the most efficiently handled
246.09,250.11, new york information under the signal channel in this form
250.32,254.46, automatically decoded in los angeles and this farm
254.7,259.14, even here we find redundancy contracting noise
259.41,269.49, language is about one half redondita framework helps prevent the stars the message in the retinue are in the spoken language
271.02,277.44, speech the brain is usually the information source from it the message is selected
277.5,280.59, messages he thought not the words
280.8,290.55, the book mechanism codes the words and de vibrations and transmits them as sound across the communications channel which is of course the air
290.97,293.22, sound of the word is the signal
293.43,301.83, except the signal and with the associated it nerve becomes a signal and delivers a message to the destination
302.37,308.67, time noise could originate in a transmitter or in sound vibrations that disturbed the channel
309.03,317.01, could be a nervous condition on the part of the receiver and i could change the message from my love you to i hate you
317.52,319.35, do you combat it
319.59,321.96, through redundancy
321.99,325.29, i love you i love you i love you i love you
325.44,336.57, another is increasing the power of the transmitter the combat is as does the careful beaming of the signal are duplicating of a message by other signals
341.4,345.63, let's consider amount of information communicated
345.84,356.07, message cell contained one bit or unit of information because it was a choice of two possible messages by ourself
356.55,359.94, choice of two gives one bit of information
360.48,366.15, the amount of information that one on circuit can handle at one time
366.39,368.55, be on or off
369.42,373.47, of information is the amount two circuits can handle
373.83,377.1, there is a choice of our possible conditions
377.19,378.45, of
378.54,380.04, on
380.07,383.1, on or off
384.03,388.8, it can handle three bits o choice of eight possibilities
389.55,393.45, for bits or sixteen possibilities
393.93,397.17, the thirty two possibilities
397.17,398.58, but
400.44,405.36, amount of information increases as the large of the number of choices
406.23,412.23, the message i love you to communicate information must also be a choice of other messages
412.5,419.04, if the information source were so loaded with feelings of love as to be incapable of any other thought
419.16,426.12, and surely by the time the words i love you were spoken no information was communicated at all
426.33,427.92, information
427.98,433.14, previous experiences could make those three words convey grace meaning
435.18,438.78, source message transmitter
439.83,442.2, a destination
443.22,448.41, imagine the message being music and the transmitted signaling to
448.56,454.56, to be applied equally well to writing or to smoke signals are to hand signals
455.07,461.13, take painting as another example of a signal transmitting a coded message
463.08,469.71, formation source mind and experience of painter message
470.01,483.6, concept of a particular painting transmitter his talent and technique signal the painting itself receiver
483.93,492.93, all the eyes and nervous systems and previous conditioning but those who see the painting destination
493.14,525.78, mind their emotions their experience now in this case the noise of pentateuch signal can take many forms he can be the quality of the light or the color of the light or the prejudices of the bear are the gideons of the painter but besides noise there are other factors which concept information from reaching its destination in testation and conditioning of their ceding are
526.05,545.67, so different from that of the transmitter but it may be impossible for the receiver to pick up the signals without distortion in any communication system the receiver must be able to decode something of what the transmitter coded are no information gets to the destination at all
546.18,551.04, speak chinese to me i must now chinese to understand your words
551.49,558.96, even without knowing the chinese language i can understand much of your feelings through other codes we have in common
561.12,567.21, systems of communication where there is no redundancy and no duplication of the message
567.75,577.95, knowledge of the code is essential in planning one is fit land to a piece the fellow on the opposite shore simply had to know the code
579.63,608.76, but there are also many examples of times when the message has been conceived and the signal sent long in advance of understanding or acceptance of the code employed in the case of galileo or sockets it did not in time matter that the receivers of their time were not tuned to receive their signal the ultimate transmission of such a message represents communication of a very complex ardor
609.03,630.63, other hard level communication occurs in very different areas a wave breaking on a beach brings a world of information about events far out at sea i can tell of winds and storms the distance and the intensity it can locate reefs and islands and many things if you know the cold
630.63,682.8, i see antoinette
682.95,697.2, then we watched them turning and wheeling how often have we wondered what hold such birds together in their flight communication is that which links any organism together
697.98,701.28, communication that keeps us society together
701.7,707.1, these people seem unaware of each other's existence neither looking or speaking
707.37,713.07, meet and filters through the other with hardly to individuals coming in contact
713.43,722.58, constant as the flow of information and so complex the web of communication to keep them apart and hold them together
725.58,726.75, some
727.05,729.33, think of an idea
729.63,733.14, communication at once anonymous and personal
733.83,738.63, the cause of the countless individuals that created its farm
738.93,744.87, who in his turn added something good or who took something bad away
745.47,752.28, anonymous because of the numbers of individuals involved and because of their consistent attitude
752.67,757.2, are examples of communication of an idea through symbols
757.53,779.79, he can also be communication through symbols to an idea as in the bank offering or in the flame of the candle here
782.61,822.48, the sublime as a transmitter in the communications channel is probably as old as man's first fire it stands for all the wonder and mystery of course beyond man's knowledge the storm warning flags or part of a long evolutionary tradition of signals but their beginnings were probably in basic reactions to colour and form basic enough to make their communications carry beyond the barriers of language and custom
822.6,827.82, he
827.94,840.45, but symbols also change in evolved
840.75,844.89, some methods of transmitting messages rapidly become symbols
845.34,847.59, pass into obscurity
847.68,851.04, become readable only to the anthropologist
851.58,854.88, other symbols of communication remain
856.17,886.83, he hestitated her animated at the range and the subtlety of its idea that the method and the signaler such that they must be fed to the transmitter in a series of positive decisions the system calls for the key to be either up or down a cold calbraith current flows
887.01,889.83, as to flow it flows
890.01,891.21, black
891.3,892.5, white
892.71,894.0, so
894.06,895.29, go
895.56,899.79, on our alone or not
899.79,904.38, god or no god or black or white
904.53,909.33, in this small area from a half tone reproduction in a magazine
909.81,911.55, press the print of it
911.67,915.69, capable of printing but one color of at a time
915.9,918.72, this case black king conifer
919.23,924.33, to transmit the image it had to be broken down to many points of the station
924.69,926.34, a white
927.0,932.19, we know that such a limitation is not at all restricting if enough decisions are made
932.4,937.02, this case half a million decided points give fair edition
937.23,938.97, millions would be better
940.86,943.05, no printing of color
943.05,946.74, no different except that with the added factor of color
946.74,950.13, times a number of decisions had to be made
950.37,955.11, and yellow one in red and blue and in black
955.86,964.74, added factor in a problem or recognized the number of decisions necessary for the solution grows by largely
965.4,977.88, theories and equipment and men developed it becomes apparent that one sure way of handling multiple factors is to build a system that can handle each decision in its time
978.27,986.1, men had long known the fairy on which complex problems of many factors can be saved but the number of decisions
986.52,1007.7, calculations that these were prodigious and not until the recent development of the electronic calculator could these areas we touched the problem became one of communication between men and machines between machine and machines between machine and man the cords are punched are not pushed
1007.82,1014.03, passes are stuck and by this binary system information is fed the machine
1014.81,1020.12, we will hear sounds which are an actual product of a huge calculator
1020.87,1026.63, fences are made audible to check its functioning and in a way feel its cross
1027.11,1028.34, here it is
1063.08,1072.08, the ability of these machines to story information manipulate sarten deliver it is fantastic
1072.41,1079.19, with their complex feedback systems their memories their almost human reactions to situations
1079.34,1084.44, understand that they are popularly referred to as brains
1084.44,1087.98, the greatest balancing the comparison is one of the great
1088.43,1094.16, decisions made by the machines are comparable in number to half million in this half tone
1094.7,1102.89, a greater is the number of stops and goals be formed by the human nervous system in order to complete the simplest act
1103.34,1104.6, so great
1104.78,1109.16, decision were represented by a small half tone do
1109.46,1113.09, total area dots would cover several herds
1113.57,1139.4, the magnitude we reach when a number like a half million is raised the fourth power as glowing as the human movements may sing they are actually the product of these countless yes no decisions communicated with great speed to and from all parts of the body the channel is the nervous system teacher is made up of hundreds of fibers
1139.4,1143.12, the decision is the impulse of a single nerve fiber
1143.39,1167.24, all out of that a tigress which is set off by an explosion and stimulus succeed the ignition point the doonha to the hole in the pane each as a separate fire no fire signal but together they add up to a smooth sometimes incredibly complex action but often seems more vague than decisive
1167.78,1175.07, yes many things which except as undecided vagaries would be if we could bring our focus in sharp
1175.19,1187.22, if individuals it is the responsibility of selecting and relating part it makes possible a whole which itself has unity
1188.18,1199.25, the line on which each color breaks and the point at which it dorama up this painting is placed affects the whole can
1199.28,1209.93, communication of the total message contains the responsibility of innumerable decisions made again and again always checking with a total concept
1209.96,1229.37, constant re back system these elements of a communication system act together as one great toil and though the pool may promises
1229.46,1233.66, never relieved the man of his responsibility
1233.66,1235.58, where the curves
1235.61,1241.76, no matter what the technique communication means the responsibility of decision
1242.33,1288.23, all the way down the line
