0.12,105.36, i'm shell greenwell and immature the consultant and a touch for health instructor i'm very passionate about the way touch for health as able to influence the tools that can go into the hands of the everyday person and how any one can make a difference for somebody i have lots of people who ask me about when they go for a walk they don't have the strength that they like to have while there walking and so a lot of times they choose to take flat pathways where they taking hills out or stars and that can be simply because the quids are functioning the way they want them too and they don't have the strength they should have so i was going to show you how i can check to see if the time must is working and if it's not how i can fire it up some one to get an attache to raise her right way and all i'm going to do is push down on that leg you hold there don't let me push down galette other one she is trying and that muscle was not working so what we're going to do is rub underneath the ribs which is the nearest for the quiet and we're going to fire those muscles back up so that the energy flow is coming back into the bustle so holding on and hover and now with even more pressure for me those legs aren't moving at all noisome people that complain once they start walking they have trouble with their shins really hurting and you can check a couple different muscles but the one of focus on to day is the proteus muscle which runs along the side of the leg here and its responsible for how the foot does this action for a lot of times when people walk that must might be shut off and its requiring other muscles to do more work so when i get attached to the put her foot up like this what i'm going to do is push the foot in and down so you hold there
106.05,110.1, a hut and other
110.1,137.16, and that is also a pickin see the whole body did i twist there so that one is linked to the bladder meridian so what i'm going to do as i want to trace the bladder meridian so that we can fire that using an electrical circuitry so i want to go from the top of the head over the top down the back there are two channels for the bladder that run down the back so i'm tracing through the back
137.31,142.53, twice there when he traced the whole pattern three times
142.53,150.66, so we can fire that system up to we come back old anon and you hold there
150.9,158.73, and now the muscle doesn't move okay so we've done a neronic correction and we've done
158.76,180.03, marian correction so now when i'd like to do is see if natasha has a pain anywhere and in focusing on a series of muscle groups the okay so on a scale from zero to ten where with the pain be aboon what is it feel like when you move where does it pinned
180.24,185.52, okay and is it stabbing pain burning pain
185.94,189.24, more pressure building up like
189.54,253.95, kind of hard to say like a stabbing pain more because it is consolatory comes when the movement comes okay so what i won do first with god and valuation of pain five other ten with got on is it feel like so we can notice the difference when we're finished and what i want to do is make sure there is no emotional involvement in the muscle that constricting the muscle to hold it so i'm going to use a tool that i called the innate matrix memory and its combined with injury recall which is another tool that comes from applied tecolote and what it's going to apply that to see if we can release some of the emotion that man might be blocking there okehurst thing that we're going to do is make a cone with the fingers when i put it to the jaw and was gone you do not your head forward three times i was recalling the back of the neck were actually access ing into the back of the skull and into memory okay for emotions so that when i get her to touch a twenty on the top of the head was near the back side your fingers back the slit there and then nodded three times there
255.51,262.38, okay and now we want to go to the pain sit so put your hands where you can feel the pain and then odour head three more times
264.54,285.66, her pain is in her back so we're also going to add a little tap into the ankles so that we're accessi information that's in the joints between the athens of the foot and the leg so here's going to tap into the bone there and will do both sides since the pain is on both sides
287.04,299.37, perfect and the pain is running down the back of the body which means we want to access the meridian closest to that which would be bladder and so we're going to tap in between the eyebrows which is the end point
299.82,303.09, the american or some of the collective first point
303.36,308.07, and from there we're going to take the finger like this
308.07,344.19, sword fingers it's called we're going to go around the left ear from top to bottom when i pass through there six or seven times an that's acceding into the amygdala in the brain recovering letting got any emotion and now it is on a link up the body so that the brain and the body or having a conversation together some one to get attached at the tap on the top of her head this time at the front on intercontinental there were going to tap on the front of the chest just below cape twenty seven and that's on time and we tapena the top
344.49,350.88, and bring it back down so we released in motion involved with the back
351.03,360.96, and what we've done now is linked up brain and body so that movement is no longer constricted by any emotion okay so if you move your back now
361.71,388.98, as free as a kano construction but i want to make sure all the muscles are still firing crackly so i'm going to take the group of muscles that would be responsible for the movement and the way the lower back is functioning so i'm going to check the quids in relation to the back injury in the back pain that she was talking about and if you can in a moment so you take your leg pull it up and hold there
389.34,405.93, okay has integrity but at last a little bit since we did our last exercise that's got little bit of lost there as well i'm going to get her to cross her hands over and when he checked the abdominal so feeling forward in ganache by pushing up you hold there
406.83,417.48, got a little bit of gift on it okay so then i'm going to take the doctor's so putting your foot in on going to actually pull out you hold there
417.78,420.27, that one's going to hold and the other side
