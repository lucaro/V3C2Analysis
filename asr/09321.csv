206.1,212.34, how they remember and how the mind works really and it's nothing
212.37,253.38, people with learning disabilities are often excluded from decisions about them as others do not know the best way to involve them there is therefore a risk that the person's views and needs are assumed we need to use the information in the person's communication passport to help us think of creative ways of getting their views and involving them in decisions in order to achieve this we need to make our communication as inclusive as possible in order to support both understanding and expression inclusive communication means that we use any means possible to support the person to understand and be understood
255.78,467.07, we will use the best ways to support each person with the communication once we know and understand the best ways to support some one's communication we need to make changes to how we communicate to make sure we are as inclusive as possible this may involve making our language simpler or using different ways of communicating such as signs gestures pictures or objects to help each person understand we also need to remember that communication is a two way process and we need to understand how the person expresses themselves and respond positively to their communication we also need to be aware of things that will affect communication such as hearing the solar sensory difficulties we need to make sure that our communication has a positive impact on each person emanates on an the apothetae a cantatrice throughout his dead has been very useful the first time i met resignation on christmas twittering the opodeldoc sir meeterly by himself i could tell me what he wanted where he wanted to go where he wanted to do the groping about the atbara it elaborate choices and decisions damnation for people to communicate we will create understanding welcoming and socially rich environment to ensure the development of positive relationships that give opportunities for good communication each person needs to have the opportunity to communicate about all of the things that all people talk about such as dreams hopes fears or choices as well as every day wants and needs good communication is about social interactions such as greetings sharing stories and having fun if these interactions are positive they will help with emotional and mental well being providing a sense of belonging involvement and inclusion these interactions do not always involve speech and can be about being with the person making menomonee with them and doing things together we have the chance provision we wanted them the paper would learn dispirits to be up to serve in that case so in order to do that we had to develop a man and order form system to use catalogues and take boxes
