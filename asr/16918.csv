0.03,43.68, it is the first time ever that we have the secretary general banion actually organizing or setting up a calling for wild humanitarian summit the title of that summit is one so many shared responsibility my question to each of you what does that titian to you and your ganistan were sunshine you know major recommitment especial states around some of the basic you know basic principles and commitments they've taken and i think sharply this has a responsibility of humanitarian aptitude to be effective
43.77,92.22, foliations and as a responsibility of state to to uphold what they have committed to several times aviator that with all the challenges we face in the world to day it's not one actor actually going to be responsible for solving the problems and therefore in it was set out as moistness to make sure that one hatshopsitu which by the reason now tenanted responsibility is for everyone just look at the headlines look at the newspapers it is very clear wentilation summit and i the secretary general's initiative was really very timely tea what would you like the summit to fix from the face point of view
92.4,113.25, you know my biggest fears we see people at the center we don't really know what we're talking about because he can be quite rested the really brings it to question you know are we really meeting the need of people what they really want are we really putting people at the center is a big question we need to print
113.31,128.1, the talk so i think that's a big question mark i do wid it to re examine if anything i hope the conscience of human turn actors that actually the perception of it an actual is not what we think it is
128.31,148.17, who are supposed to put at the centre don't realising there the center if there is only one key concern that you need to say this you need to fix casters my staff won't be able to wake any more which one it is we need to state to reform but you know the doctor of your enemy is not your only
148.17,178.53, here a lot of narrative by states that are security forces he look at the headlines everything is is focused on security issues of states how do you change the narrative of state and linket this humanitarian principles and i asking this to the representative estate here described retires as a cruiser floating in the ocean for affected people
178.8,180.57, i kept
181.08,194.91, every stakeholder with it with his own usher on remote control trying to have the cruiser in a port they would like to see what we need to see that the end of the summits
194.97,203.7, leave the level those remote controls and we should get on the garboard for me
203.79,244.95, the summit itself is not the end point i think it is it is not even the climate i think the most important thing is what happens afterwards to make sure that we do in cereals happening afanasy thevenin here in terms of expectations of people have for the voltigeurs both a very concrete cold to action that the commitment than to be made in the stumblings behold a word to actually oberlander of things that people actually do and follow up and both in fact also number of voices that illustrate the diversity of human iteration raising very different issues from health
244.95,270.87, even questions around nuclear incidents and how that would affect health to questions around usually return that to actually some perhaps of what i would call the key heartily around to behavior of states when it comes to a holding humanitarian or solitary broad game that will be discussed discussed establishes understandable but at the same time we hope particularly we here geneva hope that he will be some focus
