16.47,307.83, i mandeliere here in the last attack about ropes and knots for scouting ropes are your basic insurance policy for the back country they allow you to tell over a cliff get over all sorts of stuff they are very useful very handy to which rob to jews for scenting is always a quandary what i like to use is a standard thirty meters that's how long it is by about a nine point two diameter rope and this is called the dynamic rope so that means that it has stretched to it but not too much stretch totalling in the mountains me dave a way to manage your rope what i like to use is called the mountaineering coil and that i do as i like nice symmetrical coils and that requires putting a little bit of a twist and doing it with my thumb at the top of every coil is unwrapping and around i know when i'm uncoiling the rope i also give it a counter drest and the last coil when you realize you have about to be three or four feet left you do a short coil so it's just a little bit shorter than the others you can ahold it your hand you pinchas small loop going backwards now then you take this rope you reach under and this is the trickiest part about it because you want to get a nice tight leather to get that going now you're kind of going back on it self like that keep each one nice and tight keep going into you've got pretty short little and then you take that poker when you're able to find which one to pull because i your short rope and short line full at three snoop not up you can easily carry it like this is easy to take off and hand to somebody a this is the mountaineer in coil on the thirty metrophanes most important thing is how you attach it to your body and the basic not for doing that is called a figure desponding away from you like this inchoate your thumb wrap it around and hogirano its namesake figure at when you tying in you want to pass through to the leg loops and the waistcoat you're not tying it through your blame you just follow it back around will allow trappean follow that's a figure at that figure not is also a very good one to use to tie off to an anchor like a tree sky cutting may be giving somebody quick skeleton like that it is a minimal amount of rope said you goin to repell off a tree if you just wrap it around like this when you pull the rope down after you done that's going to cut a slain the tree is not good for the tree it's also not good for your rope you get a lot of guadenhutten locking carabinero two regular caribbees with the posing gates like this you would then clip the rope in this whole idiotic to the tree not as a final step you oppose the gates so there not to pointing in the same direction and you pelle down when you get down and you're done he pulled the rope at the bottom serpent that i prefer to use over a blade of ice is called a monteith it's so easy to tie it can be confusing you just put a twist in it and rapierlike that there's your monthlies two parts and then you clip your caribbean directly through those lock it up and you're in business beauty of this is that it reversible to going down to get to the edge of a cornelia it reverses itself around faroese back in like that and i like that because it's just one last piece of gear it means all you need is a harness a locking caribbee and your rope you don't need to bring an extra plate avice repelling with it and something happens like say you get hit from above by a bolder and you let go there's almost no friction to it so you really have to keep a tight hold on it but it works well a small robes it's very simple its reversible it's just a brilliantly great sheeting not to montrigone hidalgo be tied with a double row of trouble rope at the everett same thing you just wrap it around like that he get your look go through this time of clipping through all of them it looks a bit masses thing nice reversible not simmer others useful in the mountains as they are in your bedroom
