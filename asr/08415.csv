0.0,7.59, her working with countries all around the plant this is a global program
8.16,20.61, really the only group in the world doing this this is alice's looking class you come here and step through the looking glass
21.12,23.16, to another world
23.52,48.96, this is where we begin this is not something to speak done on the ransomed is this is the largest ocean expiration program on planteth
49.44,51.06, is the episode
51.24,52.95, exploration
53.16,60.84, really your eyes number one in this category
60.87,128.19, we want to understand our plan we want to understand what we home when this is exploration of the second louisiana purchase this is fifty per cent of our country is full of resource its fooleries its full of places it need protected but before you can do any of the antinous driven by questions consumed with seeking answers all in the name of exploration the inner space centre at the graduate school of oceanography located on the university of rhode island's bay campus is changing the way we discover connect and process data when it comes to exploring the new frontiers of our planet the oceans in this edition of you or i to day we will uncover what modern day exploration looks like in an increasingly connected world and how the technology were developing is creating opportunities that forehanded and engage with our planet
128.82,134.91, he
137.04,195.99, exploration has always been limited by our technological capabilities how far can we travel how fast can we get there how much information and of what quality can be gathered in a place that doesn't welcome air breathing land animals technology becomes the deciding factor in the success of exploring the mysterious largely unknown ocean realm it wasn't until the late nineteen seventies that world renowned ocean explorer doctor robert ballard founder of the arms titanic and interspace centre unexpectedly realized the field of ocean exploration had hid a stalemate entered made the greatest underwater discovery made the discovery hydraheaded rift
196.02,202.38, but they were made by geologists so we had to wait two years before we could bring
202.47,216.81, first group of biologist to study this major discovery of the original i unearth and so he took them down i took one day as he was angry we do down nine thousand feet
217.14,221.19, took him to the hydro threat the submarine was an open
222.12,223.65, he looked out the window
224.43,229.26, i had already seen them so i was testing a new digital camera
230.85,234.15, and to watch the video i turn my back
234.78,236.7, the windows of the submarine
236.76,247.53, little monitor in the back of the summer antarean i'm playin away and then all of a sudden cougars was on my shoulder looking at the matter
247.71,250.2, said so what you doin solution
250.32,253.35, i said wayside
253.41,269.67, better view than i'm getting out of the window and i said you mean to tell me we brought you halfway around the world took you down nine thousand feet put you right next to the greatest biological discovery every man and you've turned your back to the window this is you had to better
270.06,271.8, this is not
274.23,326.25, centuries ocean exploration consisted of physically traveling to the area of interest casting tremendous amounts of time energy and money but it was this moment that sent ballard off on a different quest one that would shape his entire career almost immediately after the galapagos rift eive ballard began experimenting and testing new ways of connecting deep ocean exploration with the rest of the world thinking cottages exploration because i was spending all my time mostly going up and come or takes adversity ocean thirteen thousand feet take me two and a half hours to get in the morning to work in a morning to an american is spinning the bottom others here i am at stafford
326.49,330.15, reflecting upon twenty years of living an elevator
330.45,334.65, all sorts of things are happening and what tolerate sainteville
334.8,337.62, processing digital imagery
337.8,341.22, be optics and i saw in all of that
342.72,345.36, way of moving in our spirit
345.93,354.48, stead of our body and i called it celebrates the idea was that the spirit is indestructible
354.48,356.1, a move in the speed at
356.52,360.96, so why not let the body which doesn't like the bottom of the ocean
361.08,363.24, somewhere safe i care
363.45,364.71, spirit
364.86,366.06, most
366.12,371.16, it's sort of like bounty and i said that
371.4,374.7, the way we should be going that we really need
374.82,377.88, to use this advanced technology
377.94,381.39, move our spirit instead of our body
381.63,384.57, more importantly anyone can go along with us
384.72,386.97, we can do it hours a day
387.3,501.51, that was the more all came from at the heart of the inner space centre lies mission control the main hut or teleprint communication to elerson we refer to as a sweet a technologies at allows people to feel and act like their edoocation other than their present location so we do this for ships where we have tens of people on shore that are acting and feeling like their with the team that onward the ship when we first built it ten years ago it was i was going to be for he is what houston is fracastoro for inner space just like houston is mission control for outer space graced by a twenty foot screen with video projection life production studio immense date archive and more than a dozen high band with connected computers mission control allows team of scientists teachers and students to remotely participate in research cruises all while in real time therewith robotic vehicle systems are overstreet engineers and scientists on the ship that are operating this technology so were just extending that same functionally to shore so that the students and the teachers who are cheated
506.16,561.3, to carry out the operations the interspace center primarily works with two exploration vessels the evening nautilus and the noise oceano six floor these ships are connected directly to mission control and half the technological capabilities of participating remotely broadcasting live to multiple online platforms in high definition a wonderful dish the graduate school board something that this is really cutting edge technology that is being used in notiophilus recognized throughout the world plantations lovering scientists and researches a multitude of tools
561.3,636.03, but the main piece of gear on board is a remotely operated vehicle named hercules this state of the art are of b is equipped with high definition cameras i intensity light and has great maneuverability the oceanus has a similar design offering saloman tools robes and teleprint staff can broadcast live images from the robes diving on the sea floor to scientists ashore news rooms and classrooms around the world often visitors to the inner space center at you or is bahamas can watch live feet from these ships when they are actively conducting missions heselton the something they ought not now they may think it now here we can find out in an second we have so many sins that are doctors of all were constantly stumbling over a new species but we don't know that so he just pick up the fallen macallan on ourself phones we can call someone who's asleep and tell them to put up their laptop and stream the discovery while their bad in the bejones
637.2,739.74, a great thing to preternatural foreignized for successfully implementing tele presence the inner space centre has partnered with several organizations including the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the national science foundation would tell ocean graphic institution and script institution of oceanography new vessels are being constructed with smaller birthing areas and in turn lead less space to physically how scientists by their very design these new vessels will require teleprint this rewards opportunities to partner with cutting edge research glassford like the illusion allenby the dallington and managed by woods hoochan graphic institution the pliocene allemachter and hybrid underwater vehicle systems
740.25,746.88, the submarines on the ilusha can you specialized underwater communication devices to link to the surface ship
747.3,765.69, with tele presence capabilities the lucia or the first time was able to broadcast live video and audio from the submarines on the sea floor to the inner space center thousands of miles away
766.86,774.42, here able to do live live shots from inside the submarine out to the world through butternuts pretty cool
775.38,779.49, i think this sort of application
779.58,797.16, is one that i'm very interested in the idea of taking megan equipping them with terence robes and really expanding the world of our applications if you will
797.22,799.5, going forward so this is something that we're
799.5,800.55, into
800.61,804.9, here the grade school botany
805.02,807.15, i'm hoping that we'll have other
807.33,810.66, ah there are equipped with this capability
810.78,840.33, in turn provide more opportunity for participation and expert i think a lot of people have seen what we can do with the interspace center and they like it and they want to be part of it because it helps educate people all over the world tell apres the shaping the way scientific research is conducted and is changing the efficiency of a seasons but scientific research isn't the only arena the inner space center is playing in
840.9,920.91, october of puritan whackin sank the container ship alfaro leaving many questions unanswered about what transpired during the ship's final hours those lot of effort and to having teleprint support missions at sea for other reasons in fact we recently completed a project where we helped the national transportation safety board find the remains of the frochards the equivalent of the black box was lost without ship finding the voyage data recorder could provide answers as to how and why the ship sank preventing similar catastrophes from happening in the future but in order to search a large swath of ocean in an effective and timely manner multiple agencies would need to be present and collaborate during the operation by adding tolerance to the mission investigators at sea were able to connect with teams back on land this dramatically leverage the way search areas were prioritize and analyzed the mission was successful in clipping
921.24,963.24, having direct access to narraganset bay the interspace center engages with plenty of operations back at home the ocean state provides the perfect setting to pursue a range of projects in physical chemical geological and even archeological fields the graduate school of oceanography has their own research vessel the army endeavour fully equipped with teleprint and accessible to both students and faculty were quite interested in clipping our bespattered
963.48,969.87, definition video and so this was something that i was very keen about because i wanted our ship
970.05,979.11, i have that capability and we tested that system in black filosofia and we actually do
979.17,985.23, the german you vote you and the idea here was that this was a pilot
985.35,987.99, study to see how the
988.35,992.94, worked and i think it was a very successful cruise and it did demonstrate
993.12,997.26, he never can use this technology going forward
999.12,1011.96, recently another crew took place here in rhode island waters it was commissioned by the bureau of ocean energy management and goes paleontologist doctor john came
1012.23,1021.41, particular project was just off the railings to try to understand how that landscape has evolved since the last ice age when native people were living here
1021.83,1032.42, with large volumes of water incorporated in massive glaciers sea level during the last age was about one hundred twenty meters lower than it is to day
1032.42,1040.04, during this period native inhabitants could walk from mainland rhode island to block island without getting wet
1041.0,1054.35, the university of rhode island invited members of the narraganset indian tribe and other local tribes to participate in the cruise with hopes of reconstructing details about that now submerged terrestrial landscape
1054.62,1055.28, he
1056.09,1082.4, the collected sentiment corps there were analyzing those sediment chores to recreate the trusteeship that is now submerged than they were educating the native american folks on what their tribal lands are today and what they were in the past so very rewarding project because we got to the intrinsic
1088.43,1121.04, radiate ability to bring people along on the cruise without physically being there has opened the doors for interdicting collaboration and participant access a new professor of physical oceanography melissa amand just completed her first cruise as chief scientist with the revendeuse ying currents of the coast of southern new england ohias introduction
1121.88,1133.25, before i started that i applied for ship time on the endeavor and that was that i lived in evermore and so i applied for this
1133.28,1144.2, over a year in advance of one cruise was actually going to be held as the time for the crew approached i learned that i was pregnant and that i was
1144.35,1158.36, to be about almost months pregnant during the period of the cruz not wanting to give up an important opportunity to kick start her lab and test instrumentation melissa was determined to find a way to lead the crews
1158.48,1237.2, he approached dean corliss and learned of telephone and unless a man ran the cruse as chief scientist here in this building using elopement so as it's a great example of how you can use this application to solanum challenges and i think it was very successful and people certainly at while the crew under the cinematograph dorotheenstadt about what different things she had been seeing in the beecher an element of expertise that we don't have and wouldn't have had on the ship
1237.59,1238.88, it was a tolerance
1240.17,1251.69, as a matter that perogative controlled the interspace center offers a range of outreach and engagement opportunities for the public
1251.69,1256.85, including expansive programs for high school students teachers and educators
1257.57,1284.12, so we've had lots of different educational initiatives with different schools throughout oisland and even suedeland and so a time we can bring those teachers in those students and in fact we host several summer camps where students from rhode island and by connecticut and massachusetts can come and spend a week here and i learn all about what the interspace entertained
1284.45,1384.8, because we have partnerships with no other national oceanic atmospheric administration and partnerships with dr ballets programs with the ocean exploration trust they actually have internship programs and teachers programs that they can apply to so there's opportunities there for teachers and students to apply and by nature of their participation in those programs they get involved in the interpenetrating their missions as intimidates widespread and by what we are learning to the general public this is an avenue an opportunity to be able to do that in a way that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to sotherton
1384.92,1399.8, really i think we being a tapestry of stories together at that really convey the essence of forward trying to get at weenan where this technology we can reach every school
1399.92,1401.12, island
1401.21,1406.04, every school and as every school on the planet
1406.25,1408.47, touched by this interspace
1409.46,1410.21, pretty 
1413.24,1459.35, for decades scientific research remained much of a mystery to non scientists but that era is over tele presence in the collaborative operations of the inner space center are expanding every year connecting more people from different disciplines and fields giving them a front row seat to discovery and exploration research is expanding exponentially and data processing can now happen in her real time the implications of this hath been and will continue to be profound for our global community where will exploration be in five years ten years twenty
1459.38,1462.53, likely beyond our wildest dreams
1462.77,1470.33, but one thing will remain certain will still be driven by questions and on a quest to seek the answers
1479.84,1509.75, haiatalnefous
