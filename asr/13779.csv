1.65,22.41, so i was using the camera as a kind of to record events his memory had suppressed as using it this wine combat the camera what could be the rules or what were the rules for him of these resulting photos now that he was at home you know what were they for him and what could they be for me in what could they be for the rest of us
22.5,24.09, and should they
24.48,31.59, these are the kinds of these are the kinds of questions i was exploring and got to explore with riley through this book
32.91,39.18, so i'm trained as a photographer but here i was more interested in dealing with
39.18,40.59, materials
40.62,44.1, that already exist the people already of made
44.13,46.77, and learning about them together
47.58,52.71, provide the chain of events that lead your mind into a state where it is okay to kill somebody
52.8,57.63, you don't remember the sequence of events that took his there you can believe you were a monster
58.71,74.19, this is a picture that rallied took when he was in a part of a convoy going underneath this overpass and what what he's looking at in the picture when he took it and talks about it is the truck that's up on the bridge
74.4,83.94, you know when he looks at the photo you remember as i ukwere like who is this what do we do you shoot him do not you know everybody thought about it and i've got a
83.97,87.48, cameron one hand and got a gun in the other hand and
87.63,92.07, i don't really know what to do so i guess i'll just take a picture
92.52,95.67, so that in this particular case that's what he did
95.85,104.79, as for me i'm thinking about the different ways people use the camera and in her i think one way is that it's used as a kind of
105.03,112.89, away to find have some sort of power or have some sort of control in a situation where where he felt powerless
112.98,121.5, and you know susan saunters about this and on photography she's talking in particular about tourists in this case where they use the camera when
122.94,129.6, as a way to do something you know when you're not when you're not doing anything when you can do some anything at least you can do something
129.6,131.82, i think that's one way it happens here
131.91,139.38, another thing of course it struck me when we talked about this photo and other people talk about similar photos is
139.68,140.85, the
140.85,148.71, the arbitrary or the quickness with which people may have to make and do make these kinds of decisions so
148.86,151.74, life is ended you know or it's not
152.67,156.87, in this case the person who was on top of the bridge
157.32,159.06, was
159.24,161.52, all of course
162.33,170.25, conflicts today are the most photographed and being used in a lot of ways that we can talk about if you like
170.31,175.05, the important and interesting and at the same time
176.19,179.13, have been soldiers have been
179.34,188.04, pictures in combat for a long time this is a photo of my grandfather that i found when i was a little girl
188.1,190.56, he was a world war i veteran
192.51,204.63, and was one of the first tanks to kind of roll into the concentration camp nor house in germany which is now which became eastern in toting
204.78,206.85, so the
207.27,212.31, says april tanten forty five nor houser germany
212.49,214.65, bring concentration
216.3,218.13, in russian victims
218.34,219.54, this
219.99,222.45, and it's the ice saw this
223.83,225.69, i feel today
226.98,232.32, the simple statement and as if you were trying to prove it to himself
232.47,235.26, just the simple fact that this
235.35,238.26, the bid was said it existed
239.46,240.84, and
241.11,243.18, i think it some level is the
243.21,252.51, one of the most primary parts of photographic act to say that this this happened even if history is rewritten
252.54,260.19, it can't be refuted or at least to say that my experience this is my experience of happened that part can't be repeated
