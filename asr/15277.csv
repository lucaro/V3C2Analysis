71.67,83.31, who have graciously contributed an we'll talk about that the coot watched tom horney whispered to the author of the biography which is
83.61,347.43, i dare you to get through the first chapter without clean no fences no horn and jo artist horn the owld man of the ozarks who keeps us focused on testudinata been developing so quickly it whispering ponies ranch if we go a couple of weeks without stopping by almost leeftenant propensities and the hackman and hadmiration with us and it was really an idea that our good friend steve coil had he said it because he penetrate sees the vision and the dream he himself fell in love with one of our flashy little miniature horses right enamoured cowboy since then i think he calls him tabooneeah hampering the necessities of two thousand seventeen forty oaths during the show we're going to start running the raw family kids camp and we've had the national director of the founder they bend their rash they really believe in what we're doing in the vision and we can talk about ramilie doing this but anyway people responded to that and they helped us raise the money by sponsoring a pony at whispering ponies ranch and people want no more about that thing go the website by watch tokamahamon upon and they can read what that's all about and so now the main primary building is under construction vattellina for the exterior part of the building the roofing and all that is setting the right now and we've got a construction revertit now to day actually standing the building up and building that now of course we got a raise the money to do the insight of it but it's one of the last major buildings that we have to build that gooroomahashoy therewithin and they often receive assistance through government subsidies and things like this there expectation for the types of camps that there allowed to use is pretty high so in the early cooeperating this thirtieth we had with all types we had like activities can doing high ropes challenged courses outdoor schools low opechancanough sitooation to sit for high and then of course it was more than a football field and lengthen
347.55,350.58, these were these were tools
350.61,359.25, help build trust communication getting children into an environment where they're distracted from where they were
359.88,404.88, wards of the state children that have been abused in unimaginable ways on every level getting them out of those situations and into an atmosphere where they can basically have fun for a week and all of it being seen in learned to communicate learn to trust open up again and jesus has a plan for your life despite what the world has tried to make you feel or you're no good you're the discarded child the nobody that is as mekenses and so what we did was we worked with the aca which is the american camping association back in the early to thousands the criteria that we had to meet in order for us to be certified through the acathistus strange in everything from the way we stored chemicals
404.94,468.63, to safety pools safety data sheets on where chemicals were stored were vehicles were stored where were the keys to each vehicle where they walked during the day how many counselors to children one of the facilities like to they meet certain regulations where are the showers located in concern to where the cafeterias and at stuff like that the ropes that we used we had a sixty foot rock wall that i also was certified to oversee it was amazing to see these kids feel like their reaching there being challenged and he go further than they think they can with the encouragement of counsellors and things like this huge brand new swimming pool while we were there we had a lot of improvements to the camp ground of the facilities i was one of two central organ that was americaine roscoe and a lot of the stuff and i look back and i often wondered
469.11,474.03, that was a really interesting chapter and we sure did a lot there for a decade but
474.12,506.64, in the past one i need experience and i've taken so much from that as i moved even into television and stuff that there's lessons i learned from that than apply now but it still this kind of this veuille see the like rather had a different plan and he would use therapy animals and he would bring this whole this whole train of coalition of efforts from various people that contributed there back totally different state now but one of the groups that we worked with was royal family
506.82,523.83, i'm tickled to death i can't believe i get to work with sky watch but also kind of re introduce some of the experiences i had at that harrowing very closely with groups like royal family to see these kids that need rehabilitation so much be able to common experience the joys of camping
523.92,632.19, music next to the fire pit we planned resketched and skips and live live dramatizations and something that needs to be added to what joe was saying here all at no cost to family blessing a whole new different kind of stand right in the nation that's why the national leaders were here they were these i know that they were here just a couple of weeks ago and had the opportunity to totality to watch we met with them they got to enjoy one of the wonderful unchristianity falmouth niaiseries called the trefethen you see citizen and a little boy looking over a pond but i watched it and i've meaning to tell you guys i watched it over the week end with my kids and you know me i don't cry alice at least five times during this movie and i think for me it was very close because if a person wants to know what are they that is royal family they're talking about this group gotteland
632.37,685.05, it's heart breaking but it's wonderful at the same time this young boy is being violently abused at home and the movie opens a right away and you're just if you have any experience with children or if you're a parent you just can't imagine treachery he interested was explaining that that move was largely based on all trevarthen you get to the very end of the film you even that were characterized in the film you know as the credits are rolling their actually talking about a remembrance that really happened and will it and some of these he is where i foster caretakers now here in this situation they come into the rough family later you see them grown up i was las
685.05,754.41, cross roads side cooney i could wound up in you know in drugs or in repeating the same kind of terrible stuff that sometimes happen i could have been a prison but today i worked for a raw family kids glueing other children escape it is but it's the only program of its kind and the wainscoating seven per cent of all children all children alternate care so it is an amazing ministry continues to grow and our part in all of this is that work creating a camp ground in missouri the people that are sponsoring upon they are helping us build at him together that we want to do for them right now when they sponsored them neediness because this testators point and then made us also when they sponsor a pony and ototototoi screen but when they sponsons also sends them anasco
754.41,885.69, the horse that they have that they have pondered that they have adopted to have printed his nonentity it is the horse got down murdieston the pictures going to the what we're sending right now but there's some other things were going to do for them later so what they need to know is the roll family camps normally as expensive it cost something like maybe five hundred dollars per kidogo to these camps so even a small cameroon at a budget of twenty or thirty thousand dollars what i were viewers and supporters are helping us do even when they watch a program and they go into our online store lisa that by doctor heizer's book there is a percentage of everything that is going into building whispers one's reuniting this cost and it is our intention yuente retirement savings near back into this ministry and other people are helping us do this and we need more people to help us do it but are but what we're doing is were it making these camps available at no coarser tonmore kids can cut encrease now they're not under the burden of having to raise this blood in mathematical roll family kids camps here and casanova chris carmichael whose national director spent three days with us and there hoping that whispering ponies ranch is going to become a model and repeated across the nation with other people and they have the man who may have lanthorns infralapsarians whispering scanderbeg to sentence in all foster care programs guys and the movie camp if you haven't seen it that belittle boy that i mentioned
885.78,953.31, point is he finds jesus at this came and what would have otherwise certainly meant a life of probably ending up in prison or dead or whatever is totally ruined and destitute finesses and hope and i it's no other program fulfills this commission in the bible if you want to what is pure religion we detesting we go through all these different richards different ways of serving god but if you want to know what the bible says what pure religion is it says this it is ministering to orphans and widows that's the call commodatin this overcoat we do not ever be can work for whispering ponies ran but by supporting this effort there making it possible and they themselves are reaching those children with the gospel i have to tell you that when we first came down here a year and a half ago and tom was talking to sharon and me about joining sky watch for me as a broadcasting

1090.62,1099.8, back to sky watch tim derek gilbert and were talking with tom or ned or john about whispering palings ranch and
1099.89,1107.57, one of the most enjoyable aspects of relocating from illinois to come here and be a part of sky watch t v and part of
1107.6,1117.11, ponies ranches the support for the ranch that that's what i view my job every day is coming here in doing everything i can to direct attention to
1117.11,1126.38, the means that we have to finance what you all are doing at the ranch but my mother who was an animal lover in from way back and raised on a farm in north dakota around animals
1126.53,1140.81, she cows not over experiences with the cows and sheep were enjoying and she's got some story to tell you but gestation i brought her out to visit because her
1141.29,1142.7, now bring her here
1142.91,1144.41, not by her choice
1144.41,1148.88, when she saw the ponies she was sold and
1148.88,1158.15, she is so proud that she was able to talk the director of the retirement community where she lived near by in the bringing the ponies out on a regular basis
1158.24,1163.34, now the ponies are cute to and they are adorable so well behaved
1163.4,1165.32, what is the role
1165.32,1166.82, they play
1166.94,1198.77, whispering ponies ranch with these children by these children you know some of them and missus canby hard to talk to her and a chuck up better like to wispering to these young kids on this program there are lots of kids that are not even in the foster are and have things that they deal with at home but these kids when they come and visit the ranch and they see these little animals they are so unassuming there's nothing within them the agenda of this animal that is going to intentionally harm this
1199.16,1229.25, kid these these kids can scratch on these ponies and made don't have any fear that this animal has a motive for receiving that it's just a pure a pure contact and connection where these kids can start beginning to learn all about trust an amazingly these the horses also are giving trust because horses are born scared of everything and so when they reciprocate the scratchings
1229.25,1240.14, saying to the kid will i trust you too and it's really really helps these little ones to understand that trust is mutual and it has to start somewhere in sometimes that that touch
1240.32,1276.05, if these animals is so powerful testators have amazing power to communicate trust in he and i were talking he the night about some of the other ways that we could use these animals joe has talked about doing a pack walk with the dogs but he was talking about doing that with the ponies and i had an explored that idea put a little back pack on a pongo walk to me that was one of the best ideas i've heard because i've been trying to figure out the creative ways to use these animals could you can always put upon on a part and give it to a kid is said to have fun because these animals are pulling
1276.05,1295.04, they do need direction you have to make sure that you are experienced in them so that's one aspect that you can use these animals but you have and there that's also again there's not bond between the animal and man bear trustee and the crisis just unlimited 
1295.25,1382.73, the animal is given trust to the child but they also see that the animal is trusting to the adult the trustee said that kind of opens a door to for the child to know you can go on you can go on google and just type in therapy another website that go through all the psychological benefits of using therapy animals in a way that other humans while they've been muscle had been betrayed by humanitarian who the child intensitive the ponies is not because i want reprehensible of trust again so that they anaumadathi for the way you mentioned your mother though the arena is a training ground if we recently had a context other therapy horse ranches from around the nation that came to whispering ponies ranching or from one another and you know connecting and interacting with each other but one of the things you can only do so much
1382.79,1556.64, a therapy horse you identified their day you broke him of any bad habits they have where the maybe they want a nip or something they want to groom the child which you can well do reynal that but then you've got to take them out of the environment so they will literally a couple times promotors up and now they're going like to your mama place and the people love it attains to them yet operation for them but for our side there are practical point here were getting the horse in an environment they don't know they're goin to hear noise they see walkers they see well chairs they hear something buzzing pretty soon they're all the sensitized because you know what if i'm with my trainer i know everything is o k it's a biblical metaphor the i walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me see there learning from us what we learned from god that no matter where i go if you were with me i know you're in control right you'll just have a few minutes left so let's talk to peloponnese inmost of the big projects are either being built right now or already are finished the big huge training arena the arbor maps volunteers is practically done thistlethwaite exterior part of that building and nearsightedness stanistreet money for noninterference at westerton will be automatically paid for by us into the conference there's going to be a banquet at the conference that is only for those who have sponsored pony
1556.64,1663.68, later we're going to call this the founders club so if the calling themselves the pony's sponsor or founders club it's all one part of the same arrangement they're going to be able to come to the bank it whether governesses exactly how their investment was used in the building of the camp and in one final thing in starting in twenty seventeen for the founders club laborers were going to invite them to come to a private retreat on the grounds of whispering ponies ran the complete tour they see the way the facility of use and then they'll probably be a devotional little beretanee going to invite them to come and sit and watch the live filling of a sky watch television program so what am i saying i'm saying that by them supporting this there becoming part of our extended family and they are a part of what we are doing and we want to invite them to be part of that and we want the accountability we want them to see that if they sponsored a donation some people could do a lot more i know that there are people at have you no large amounts of money and the wondering what you know what could i do what can i support that i believe him because i don't need all this revenue in this is something they could pray about and think about two but that balthasar
1663.71,1668.09, we thank you for watching tom morton to horror i'm derek elbert
1668.3,1669.86, i watched
