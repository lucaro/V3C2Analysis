1.08,18.96, in this episode of the fact i'm going to show you how to prepare a clean up your video clotted getting it ready for color reading using senator and after effect also i show you the file method is used to getting a faster render time it's time for that lets plug in
18.96,51.0, everybody was there ever so with the effects t today we have a lot to cover so i don't want to talk too much here but this is part one of who videos that i have based on how to get your digital video prepared for color grading so let's get started an jumpin
54.75,63.09, i gave everybody here we go on to show you a little bit how i do my file as set up and also
63.42,82.35, how i basically rendered to different hard drives this does speed up rendering a little bit if you only have one hard drive that would be her share drive right here than it everything basically you don't have much of a choice but if you happen to have three hard drives this is how i set things up
82.83,88.14, first of all this little box here i represent my local sea drive
89.16,104.61, here i have all of my programs and stalled and that i have two other hard drives some little ones over here to get to them quicker but this will be one hard drive representing over here and another hard drive over here
105.45,127.92, what i do is when i get back to the computer with all my footage from my camera i'll go ahead and drag it off of the card and put it on this hard drive here first what i do is let's go back here i'll make a folder and name it whatever you know the production is or the name of the video or whatever i make a folder name it inside that folder
128.31,163.08, i you know usually make to two or three folders here one audio that would be for special effects and music voice overs and whatever you have in the audio and he pictures that you might be using in the project here and any video here so once i get the car out of the camera bring it over to the computer i will put it in sight here and i will make a couple of soldiers here i'll make one follerin me it bad i name one clean up one good and one may be so once i have all the footage right here
163.5,184.56, in this case we only have two footage because you know no sense and showing a whole bunch is the same thing with many i'll go through the footage and see which ones i'm going to use what ones i'm not going to use and one that i might use so i just go ahead and i play each video and if it's a good shot and i like it i'll go ahead now dragonite good
184.77,225.51, just like that if i find any footage that it is really really bad where i just didn't like it at all or there is just something messed up on it whether it was exposure or at fell over and we turn off the camera all those kind of things i go ahead and i drag it to the bad folder i never delete anything to you never know you might use something from it so always put it in the bad folder and if i come up on something to look decent but not sure then i put it in the may be for in this case we like these so we're going to put it in good then you see i have a pother called cleaned up and we will get to that we'll get to that later
225.96,235.74, so now that i have all the files and everything inside of this hard drive here i go ahead and i open up whatever 
235.77,244.02, program i'm going to use which is running on my sea drive and i will use the footage from this hard drive to edit
244.05,265.41, this hard drive and then when i want to render something out from the project i render over to this hard drive where you see i have a photo here called render this is so that the information isn't going back and forth from one hard drive to the other or on the same one which in causes slow down on your render so we have
265.47,273.6, the main footage over here being edited on this hard drive and then rendered to this hard drive so everything keeps 
273.6,280.98, a little more speed so there you have it that's how i set up my folders and how i render a little more
281.07,283.68, quicker using three hard drives
286.29,297.57, i want to show you how to set up a couple of after effects projects to make this process much quicker so you don't have to set it up every time so what we're going to do
298.14,301.74, and go ahead and open up after effects
307.5,313.65, now that after effects his open first thing we want to do as we want to change the
313.8,317.76, here to bid so you hold down your alley
318.03,330.75, this is on windows and click at one time with your left mouths button in turn turn into sixteen a bit then what we want to do is we want to create a composition so go new composition
330.78,341.07, and now this depends on what you're going to use but most people are going to use by and we can call this
342.63,343.77, clean up
345.93,348.96, because we're going to make two
349.59,373.56, set up there one in pain one in piece of depending on what footed your using it will be already to go for you so since this is twenty four p we want a switch this to twenty three point nine seven six h make sure it says full i would put this to one hour so you can bring a lot of footage and maybe not have to miss with this later go ahead and click okay
374.49,378.66, now what we want to do is save this out so we go file
381.36,383.01, say as
386.79,394.17, and we could let's just put it on the desk top for now just for these purposes and we can call this
395.85,398.01, up went
398.67,400.23, then go ahead and click
401.13,402.15, save
404.52,410.19, let's just check to make sure that all worked so now we've got to clean up the wick on it
419.85,438.78, we can see that it started up with you know sixteen bits a clean up twenty four p if we check the car checked the composition here to make sure his english good composition set in nineteen twenty by ten eighty o ye square pickles twenty three nights even six one hour for everything is good
440.52,445.35, now we know that this work perfect so now to make the
445.41,457.62, we can lick on don't say there now to make another one for a sixty p if you're someone like me that likes to do some sixty a filming while went to do the right click on this
459.69,461.61, click and paced
461.79,464.49, and we can go ahead and just rename this
464.79,466.02, to
467.31,470.28, lips watered of that
471.03,472.17, the
473.4,474.72, name that
474.93,477.6, now we have to just double click on that
481.23,490.26, now we just everything's the same except the names of the stuff so we want to click on the the composition here and click on enter
490.62,492.99, just change this to 
493.92,500.49, and composition settings hops with make sure we click on the composition down here composition settings
500.55,502.8, change this to
503.28,505.71, fifty nine point nine four
506.46,511.08, and i actually shoot with the tone
511.08,512.31, next
512.4,527.34, jewish actually shoots in ten eighty sixty p if you're using one of the cannon dearmer's then you might not be able to shoot in sixty patents you want a change at the seven twenty
528.15,535.11, but everything looks good everything's an hour click on okay that sixteen we close that out
535.17,541.5, sure save it make sure you say it so now you got your two clean up projects here
545.88,551.07, so now i'm going to show you how to set up a render cue so you don't have to
551.13,553.89, do this every time
553.95,561.6, will be those alone here what will do is just open up a new after effects and will do this just for setting up a render que
566.07,570.99, so let's go ahead and drag in some footage here it could be any footage
571.71,576.63, we want to get to a render render clothes dragon some footage there
580.53,583.26, drag this into a new camp
583.89,591.09, okay and then go to composition and to render cube now once we're in this render que
591.51,598.41, can set up our own render questo every time we add something to the render que it'll hold these settings
598.8,610.29, so we want to do first click on the little arrow down button quick on make template we're going to make a test on her since already made my own but we can put
613.38,617.13, i call it for to 
620.91,623.4, what we do is we click on dit
623.97,643.98, and you can change it to whatever you want but we're going to be working in the inform because when we transported all of our footage in a senator and we clean up our footage we want to render out in the same senator that we were working with so are not doing any kind of a compression here so we want to go to senior a 
644.01,657.45, we want to put this on high and you can go on high he atomized film can scan too but this really is absolutely plenty anything else is over kill
658.11,682.62, here you can see you can go to for if you like make sure this is checked click on okay and click on trillions of colors the should probably automatically be on argus alpha and we want a click on radio output make sure that's at forty eight at sixteen bit and stereo go ahead and click on okay
684.78,692.46, so if we opened his back up make template we can move the default to that new and that we just 
692.64,695.46, was it a lie clicked on test
696.15,703.62, for two click on okay now we can set up where we want these to be rendered out
704.19,707.4, and i always click on
709.62,713.4, tranced hard drive there's my render
713.76,729.6, click on open and save so now what we can do is let just cancel out of this don't save let's open it up just to see if everything worked okay so let's just see if this all worked so let's grab some footage relick
735.3,737.37, so let's say we
738.03,739.89, everything up there
740.46,742.23, to a new camp
742.41,745.53, to render this out composition
745.65,754.17, to induce so there we go it automatically comes in as that test for two to twenty four p that we set up
757.77,767.16, okay so now let's go through the clean up process i use a program called senior it's caught h d link right here
767.73,771.93, inform studio i used a premium version
771.93,817.44, if you don't have senator it's a really really good caterans code all of your footage whether you're using the phone or ach or any of the cannon line of footage just about any footage will be a translated really nice into a fort or two to or you can actually go to twelve bit four four four even with an alphabet and change it to four four four without the channel the fiery really really huge so for most of my work i just used the sinator dlink and it turns the
817.5,825.69, if tozer cannon footage and all these other different camera footage to the senior
826.11,842.67, it four two two so here's what we do okay first let's go we've got the senator h link open we want to click on convert you can select by files or select folder
843.03,862.32, click files here now let's go look for the footage that we brought in from our camera i have it under work flow folder lay out missus just for the demonstration i got under video and here's the file that would put everything in good we want a click on that one
863.13,870.15, and if we select this one now we both got him here to render que let's go to preferences
870.15,874.98, since i'm on windows i'm going to automatically convert it to a
876.03,880.95, well right there and down here is the air emits up to you
881.28,915.54, is good because i'm on if i have a client that one move because they're going to be on macaterick out one were not going to remove any pull down or anything from here keep source aspect ratio render quality high you can put on film skin to but i've read so much that about this issues here and really high is probably all you're going to need i have an anatomic i ramony click on okay oh first of all here you want to browse if you have that third hard drive or
915.6,919.05, whatever are we her computer
919.44,932.28, all my transacted stuff on my other hard drive and i click on transported got that set up o course if you only have one hard drive a basically put it wherever you want lionheart
934.11,936.18, these are going to go ahead and
936.27,941.4, take our footage and transient the senator code
945.45,952.41, osirified we go ahead and close that out and now we can go into our
952.83,958.44, or were we transacted everything and here is the newly transacted footage
959.07,965.37, and what we want to do is this i shut this in peace so we're going to click on our clean up pomp
965.49,966.66, project
968.61,980.85, it's handy to do these and just put him somewhere in your hard drive street on have to set the compositions up in the project up every time so here we got it let's drag these clips into
980.91,982.29, project
982.71,984.03, close that
985.2,987.09, we have to do is
987.45,990.87, what i did as i clicked on the first footage
990.96,995.85, down control click on the next footage and i just drag him into the camp
996.12,998.31, so now we have
998.49,1004.19, we can actually will just do one for this lesson here my host elate that
1004.25,1009.86, just do one clip so here we are belittle footage and 
1010.28,1012.92, move were going to be doing soon
1013.37,1018.86, i take quite a while to finish this film but it's going to be pretty cool malays here we go up
1019.07,1021.56, and you first a click on the footage
1027.02,1032.24, you can actually see quite a bit of noise here over a year
1032.9,1037.67, lot of just issues you could see that right there just
1037.91,1042.98, pretty bad actually if you're really picky like me you want to clean that up
1043.49,1052.49, sorry i moved footgear okay so here what we do we are if anything gets out a line like i just accidently move it you can just go ahead and write click
1052.58,1059.66, form fit to come and i'll back up for you so first of all we want to go to fix
1059.78,1062.24, we want to go to a video
1063.89,1066.32, when a click on options
1066.41,1075.86, now what you want to do is pick a spot on here that doesn't have any texture because if we were too like let's say
1076.22,1086.15, a war over here to get rid of the noise it's going to see everything in hearing get rid of that so a lot of these patterns are going to disappear you don't want that so
1086.42,1089.57, we want to move this summer where there's not a lot of
1089.96,1096.53, details so one way one place we could do it is somewhere over here
1098.24,1101.09, you do like it in this black but here
1101.78,1103.1, or
1103.7,1106.25, there is some texture in this
1106.79,1108.14, there
1112.16,1113.72, try
1115.22,1116.78, over here
1116.87,1121.67, give a try make a selection like this click on autofile
1121.79,1140.3, says the select are small you should make a bigger one but i think this will be fine who would click on yes quick on attained tune theayter settings and all this you could play around with all this but very low frequency is what i usually chick and i click on apply so now
1140.75,1145.04, we can see the difference here let's look at this black part
1145.7,1151.25, i go ahead and take off the effect you can see all this really bad
1152.03,1157.04, noise that this digital cameras make if we turn it on
1157.16,1161.15, like really smooth now we look over here
1161.87,1163.46, turn it off
1163.52,1169.19, see all this terrible noise here if we turn it on it's all gone
1169.76,1171.92, so now when you go out and
1172.85,1180.74, to turn it on looks nice and smooth here now a lot of the times when you add need video
1181.13,1186.65, you'll get some banding and those are let me see if i can find any banding on here
1187.88,1190.07, the shot might not have any
1196.64,1198.95, moved to footage again let's see
1200.93,1204.11, i guess i could have picked another foot with more binding on it
1205.28,1207.59, due to a video
1207.59,1210.68, i do not see any banding her
1215.12,1229.28, a little bit of banding here i mean i don't know if you guys can see that but let's try it let's see if we can get rid of some of this banding so to get rid of the banding and this might you might want to do this anyway a kind of even the pies out
1229.55,1233.66, make sure your footage selected good effects
1233.75,1236.63, and we go down to
1238.94,1269.03, i noise originally noise and grain when a click on noise and i know it sounds weird adding noise to a footage you trying to clean but this noise is a much more pleasing than the blocky noise from digital footage and this actually is going to get rid of some of this banding it just a little bit here but what we can usually zero point four percent is good enough if you look right here let's see if we can
1269.54,1274.79, some of this look at this area right here i'm going to turn this off
1275.09,1289.43, you could see some bending their acuter it on it goes away and if you want to get rid of morgeson six let's say now all that banding is literally gone and there's not too much noise
1290.3,1295.76, anywhere else that you can see so it gets rid of the banding even all the
1295.85,1297.32, out
1297.44,1301.1, and it looks pretty darn good if you ask me
1304.52,1359.3, okay so this is how to clean up your footage for color greeting since i'm using a screen capture program to do this tutorial it doesn't show the difference from the before and after very well because the quality is cantlow so here's a picture of the two clips actually is the one clip is before i added neat video and the noise to get rid of banding and the after is all cleaned up with neat video so i blew the pictures of the videos up to percent and if you look closely at like let's say the very lower right hand corner of the shoulder there you can see how drastically at cleaned up the noise there also even in the back one aback there although it's kind of blurred out you can see it dramatic difference on the before which
1359.63,1375.71, in the one and the after all cleaned up also the ear are you could see the clean up difference and especially on the black rubber on the mask on the left you can see a lot of the noise there and on the right is all cleaned up
1376.82,1416.45, okay so there you go that's how to clean up your footage remember this is part one so please check out part two which will be coming on the internet that pretty soon here also go to trinity affects them gammy website where in the description of the video i have linked to the senator and the script i use and also some linked to other more detailed information of what we cover to day so this is ernanton with text till next time
