0.81,2.91, just wanted to lie video that
3.87,5.55, a story
5.97,6.9, this is
7.17,11.67, actually two entrances to the clinic one for you one
12.06,15.36, license medicine
15.39,17.07, so this is the
17.46,18.09, as
18.72,24.3, he imitates in different points you see there's a big room
25.59,28.68, you are the vibrations open to
32.19,35.76, but you know even though i see that there's a
35.82,37.98, right here where
37.98,40.68, and green turning
40.92,41.97, the
42.12,48.66, and while it is true there sophistries and makes it very accessible and
48.96,51.51, control the nice pretty well
51.57,53.7, in the central location i think is
54.33,58.65, more than worth the additional work we have to go to reduce that
58.95,61.92, and i mean the view can't be beat obviously
63.27,68.64, that of the water and the mountains behind it we get to watch the boats coming to every day so this is where
68.88,71.13, people do practice here
71.88,75.33, also implies classes and we will be adding other
75.36,77.19, as time goes on
77.67,83.37, facility of course back office area that were beginning worthington
83.52,85.41, then there's a door
85.92,87.3, omnium
87.6,89.58, there's a door
90.15,93.21, to the considered so this is the clinical side
93.48,99.45, you'll see one of the first things all that is when you walk in as the chinese are all that's growing
100.02,107.43, changing every time cause can do it all on and then of course you continue to see the view
108.03,109.98, here's the waiting room
110.04,116.55, and the view from the waiting osprey nice i were still working on the waiting room and making as comfortable as possible
116.82,118.92, and now again
118.98,120.12, i
120.72,124.35, then we've got you know of course water and tea all imitate
124.74,140.46, smith teas as what we like to serve and waiting around so some people like to just show up destitute so we got two clinical treatment ramshackle clinical
140.61,142.86, the trolley going by
144.24,146.28, in summer and
146.34,148.8, other times they'll see the trolley
148.98,151.38, take the trolley to the clinic i suppose
151.59,154.17, a moderation but is
154.95,157.02, wonderful things about a story
157.89,160.74, as i was saying that here we've got to
161.52,163.05, sir
164.16,181.77, and he was the clinical entrance while the exit on and we've got him sadenwater these curtains are closed of course but that he'll see for george berenice to hang out afterward there is of course the stribling
182.43,186.93, hotels there couple other hotels behind there
186.93,189.9, and we do have parking
191.46,198.27, and going out of essarman you can see the arbalest more facilities there
199.29,206.04, and finally just to finish up this probably way too long to devote
206.46,207.84, the medicine
208.29,210.45, again the curtains are obviously
210.54,213.0, lindarasse time
213.0,214.8, when i was here by myself
214.98,216.18, doing work
216.3,218.94, i have patients i like to open up all these windows
219.24,222.06, ideas for a better office
222.27,223.86, great room for treatment
223.98,226.29, very relaxing
226.74,228.3, somehow we
228.66,230.91, the view i were doing the intake
231.18,235.83, when we poles curtains actually is a very cosy little spot for treatment
236.82,239.31, clerestory organ
239.91,240.69, watching
