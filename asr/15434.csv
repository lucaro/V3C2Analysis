250.26,251.16, he
252.24,299.1, i go to a stone how many you have that on your bucket let didn't think so that's good though there's something specific there how many you if you're honest quick show hands this whole idea of thinking about your own death kind of freaks you out a little bit you're in comfortable with it right well god knows that god knows it's not our default mode to be thinking well what if i did what would i do with the rest of my life and that is why there are so many verses in the bible that actually urge us to consider our mortality because thinking about that act to get over the hedge really adds a lot of vitality to your life to day and i want to start out very quickly with the review of that concept because we talked about this last week end in verse
299.19,300.39, life
300.42,372.78, like the morning for it's here for a little while and then it's gone and they just discovered that some ancient manuscripts the most ancient ones say unless you live in apposition about that but you know i've been researching the statistics on death and a counselling fascinating this just in apparently one out of every one of us will die it is universal and so we do need to think about it because it happened so quickly i came across one comedian's take on aging that i personally really relate to as i approach fifty very rapidly he said deelish only time in our lives when we like to get old and just kind of a demonstration of that streamlining heath only time when we like to get old as one were kids when you're less than ten years old or so excited about an that you think infractions how old are you i'm four and a half you never thirty six and a half but your four and a half going on five and then you get in your teens and now they can't hold you back you jump to the next number even if you had how old are you i am going to be sixteen
373.17,376.89, could be but you're going to be 
376.89,377.88, then
377.91,380.43, greatest day of your life
380.52,390.09, you become even the words sound like a ceremony you become twenty one yes but then
390.63,400.65, thirty what happened there next you sound like bad milk he turned he was soured
400.8,412.95, it goes down hill you see forty before you know it you rage that then the way you may get to sixty they didn't they go make it by did
413.1,420.99, you you turned thirty push forty reach fifty mesty he pulls much feed the now gaiement
421.08,442.8, and then you get into your eighties and you reach that time and then in our night as you start going backwards i was just ninety two and then if you make it over a hundred he became a little kid again i'm a hundred and the half i love that and i hope every single person here it lives to be a hundred and a half
442.95,471.84, even if we all do i care to that life just moves at such a rapid clip in fact here's a burst that we touched on last week end to a love this in fact let's read soldiers together letter you teach us to realize the brevity of life so that we may grow in wisdom it is just wise the bible says to think about the things that were suggesting i think about during this series
472.41,503.01, our family went up to san francisco the week after christmas was a lot of fun and some of us went down to the high identity embarked darrow to look at the christmas lights and we walked right past old saint mary's church which is on california rathe corner of grant and california near the edge of chinatown and what always intrigues me when i see this church is its clock tower because right under the clock you see a verse from the bible ecclesiastics for sober the time
503.1,540.63, fly from evil now as i walked past that i glanced up there and i'm kind of an amateur history buff i've been inside a lobby at the church where they have a great history display with old photographs and it just kind of and then he knowing that we were about to do this series i wonder how many people have looked up at that end of the foreshortened in 
540.75,545.73, in the distance there in the harbor you know that something they're all sailing ships
545.85,571.29, it was a different era the end of an error that humans have been living in for centuries and centuries the era of the sailing ship and saint mary's was the tallest building in the city at the time fast forward late eighteen hundred the city of san francisco starts to grow up around it closing a lot of history and in this one right after the earthquake all around in buildings of destroyed lives lost clocktower is still there
571.44,590.22, world war i they built a serviceman center in the basement right under the clock tower halfmile sailors walked in under that sign on the clock and just over three years and now of course it is dwarfed by skyscrapers all around it and as we're running past
590.37,601.14, clock i looked up and i thought of all that history and i thought how many people over the years saw this reminder in the nick of time
601.26,606.3, though they didn't know it how many men and women read it the day before the earthquake
607.32,613.05, world war i sailers read it just before they were deployed perhaps never to return
613.83,628.38, worth considering this in ephesians five starting in verse paul paraphrases that verse from ecclesiastes that's on the clock tower and san francisco he says so be careful how you live
628.89,636.33, live like fools but like those who are wise make the most of every opportunity
636.63,661.26, don't act thoughtlessly but understand what the lord wants you to do it's kind of like a christalan song he was the winner of american idol a little while back yet that had sung this last year called live like word dying that's what these verses her talking about so let's explore that in a little bit more depth this morning specifically to vital
661.38,668.37, real passion you know i've noticed when people know they have limited days left they live with passion
668.58,689.76, enjoy every sunset a saver every male they soak in every conversation and my goal is morning is to give you some basic tools that you can use this week to put some passion for life back into your life again now i got a cover a definition here why do i mean by passion
690.06,694.74, a lot of people make passion synonymous with excitement
694.86,705.36, but it's not excitement is something different than passion excitement comes and goes for example for christmas this year i got some amazing
705.45,715.47, dark swiss chocolate my favorite food item on the planet i was really excited for that chocolate i mean really excited
715.92,721.77, i hated all and now i'm not excited any more okay
722.16,723.51, not passion
723.87,743.67, excitement comes and goes passion is deeper passion is like a perpetual motion machine passion is what bubbles up in your soul she is what gets you up in the morning passion is what you have lived for and when you find passion your life is brighter your more fulcus
743.82,752.52, even more creative and your well motivated in fact i'll say this passion always outlasts profits
752.61,770.19, a motivator which agree with that in our culture in american culture a lot of people think the profits the best motivator what is it going to be profitable to me then i'm going to do it but you will find that you endure far longer when passion for something drives you and not just profit
770.94,785.91, in the book of numbers chapter fourteen there's an interesting scene the children of israel have just been released from slavery in agonies the movie the ten commandments with charlton heston okay so we number fourteen this is the end of the move
785.91,792.12, credits role and what happens next they've been released from slavery they're on the way to the promised land
792.21,796.23, almost instantly when things don't go exactly smoothly
796.35,814.11, most of the people lose their motivation because they had a profit motivation they thought they were on their way to bigger and better things when they are but not quite yet and so they start to complain they don't want to move another foot forward they start to say it was solid matter when we lived back in eyetalian
814.2,815.79, go get upset with them
815.94,833.25, these people are saying that things about me and really kind of complains to moses about the people instantly losing their passion for the promised land but then he says something interesting but my servant a
833.43,837.06, it is a different story he has a different
837.06,839.64, spirit he follows me
839.73,841.2, passionately
841.89,844.98, but you but i want to have a calm spirit
845.25,849.0, i want to have a motivation that lasts
849.0,854.91, i want to live my life looking in the rear view mirror i want to follow god passionately
855.0,861.24, i i live with passion again how i loved like that not just lilie
861.66,866.64, the quick points first of course i need to find it
866.82,882.9, i need to find my passion god has made you with a heart that beats faster about certain things he put you on earth in order to patiently pursue certain things any one stay further
883.05,889.17, a zealous state passionate look at romans never be lacking in zeal
889.2,892.62, keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord
893.07,904.74, the way the message translation puts it keep yourselves fuel and a flame and in the new living translation served the lord enthusiastically
905.13,915.21, wants me to live with passion but how i find my passion again well again the whole point to the series is how clarifying
915.45,917.01, the reply
917.37,920.19, this question is what i do
920.37,923.16, i had one month to live
923.4,930.3, we've set it up last week and this week i want to just challenge you right now in throwing down the goblet
930.6,934.68, this week to actually make a list
935.1,949.02, right down everything you think you do in answer to this question make your bucket list that's going to take some time but don't look at this as homework missus life work
949.11,963.48, sit down and just start writing it may be fifty or a hundred things on the long list just stream of consciousness i did this past week and i thought i could do things right away but i sat down and i kind of stalled out
963.66,965.25, just below 
965.55,989.13, i thought when i don't have more in the list but i left the list now with my pen in my desk here in the as the week went on i added a few more things and i think i'm edging up to about it right now but i what i mean here is very detailed just stream of consciousness right down something you would let it do some things that your passionate about some things you want to do if you had one month left to live now
989.34,992.61, with that said i know what some of you are thinking but the
992.91,1002.24, if this is really an uncensored unedited list not every passion that people might think of is necessarily a good passion
1002.6,1004.37, very true
1004.52,1049.49, just because it's a passion does not mean it is a great idea all right in fact as an illustration not know if you saw this commercial they were playing at all through the football games last weekend and i don't know the guy i don't want to judge him because maybe got quoted out of context or something but this is just fascinating watch this my wife eatanswill because that's where the action is there's only people in the sandhills out there that berthelini
1049.52,1060.44, and i'm proud of it i missed weddings i miss baby being born and when i get to the superb i don't talk to anybody
1060.68,1071.27, but that is my that not every passion in life is necessarily or that and so you got to do is look at your list of passions and go o is this
1071.51,1072.86, great idea
1072.98,1091.76, he even a doable idea and then after you your stream of consciousness thing on edited uncensored many look at that long list and make a shorter list not saying you senor your long list but you circle what you really want as part of your life now
1091.97,1095.0, obviously there's some stuff that's not worth it
1095.57,1116.87, and there's some stuff that you just can't make a part of your life right now like one out of my bucket list was at a full borasco te every day at my body would explode if i try to do that so that atomic circle or another thing was quite my job and preachifying last lecture type sermon that you guys the post on you to bardianna i inspired billions obviously i can't make that a part of my life now
1117.23,1120.23, but what can you actually make
1120.29,1141.2, part of your life right now you go to the longer lest then you circle those items what's the kind of stuff that made an on my shorter less i think that's got about things that may be the cut but let me just redeemable of five of the things that made it on my shorter less n'attend quality time with my wife more often like regular date its quality time with my kids
1141.59,1144.2, regularly to reconnect with god
1145.16,1176.87, so important for pastors and it's something that's important but not urgent so it often doesn't get done i want to take my wife to the bible and to greece to israel before i go i want to accept more invitations to preach overseas because that's a passion for me those were all items only longer bucket list that i circled because they can realistically be part of my life now and i think they're worth sacrificing to make a part of my life
1176.87,1178.52, and here's what will happen
1178.88,1180.65, out of those things
1180.74,1185.48, i listen will arise one or two passions
1185.99,1203.9, you really hold dear now it could be totally different god made us all with different passions but for example some of you might say i really want to make a difference in an overseas orphanage in the developing world while i can
1204.44,1217.34, others might say i really want to write sort of many biography of my life and how i came to the lord and the thinking that went into my journey of faith and i want to self publish it
1217.37,1241.01, so that my family can have it for years to common my story doesn't get forgotten those might be things that come out of this longer list that emerged at the top things that your passionate about and let me give you a couple of hints as to finding your passion in the longer list number one as i heard one pastor say finding your passion is not about
1241.34,1248.36, passion is not just about asking what do i like you got to also ask the question what do i hate
1248.96,1251.63, what gets my ire up
1251.96,1254.39, what gets me in sense
1254.54,1260.48, that's a key to finding your passion legalism gets my eye up
1260.48,1297.23, he that my passion is really preaching the gospel of grace i look at my wife as an example she's one of these people who is wired so that injustice really gets her eye up not nobody loves injustice when it happens to them but laurie sees and justice more broadly in the world and notices it and reads newspaper articles about it and really get seraiah that passion developed into a passion specifically for children home called
1297.23,1301.85, no place else to go most of them are from the dolly cast
1301.94,1343.85, in india the untouchables and my wife are goes with a bunch of people from the severe year to serve their i've been there our youngest two kids had been there she's on the advisory board there leaving it two weeks for another trip and it's really become her passion why because she says i am treating these children like i would like to treat the whole world and i can't do that so i treat them like i wish we could treat all orphans and it's become a passion and god has given you a heart that beats for certain things certain cases certain people and that is part of his will for your life here's a second to this is easier to see in others than in yourself
1344.27,1347.99, other people who know you well what would you say is a passion of mine
1348.53,1380.81, you say is my passion or an i had a discussion about this last night and it was just so enlightening so once you get your list you circle a few names on your list you say is any passion coming to the surface then i encourage you to put it through the bed of the last person you're not under this point seaward says this jesus said love the lord your god with all your passion and prayer and intelligence this is the most important the first on any list
1381.02,1394.52, in the next first he says and the second command is like i love your neighbour as you love yourself so once you get all this stuff just stream of consciousness you circle a few things that you think are ultimately important and then you ask why do i say
1394.64,1442.94, as this question first don't put it through this great first well because i want you to do stream of consciousness first just unguarded just right down what you'd like to do if you had one month left and then you circle a few items that kind of come to the top and then you go how does this go through this grip we love the lord with all my heart and i love my neighbour as i love myself and that helps you kind o do the last filter where your separating selfish passion from a godly passion and a selfish passion releasing its just last you know you have a less for this or for that or do you have a godly passion for this and asking yourself this question really helps to filter out that list so you find your passion you find those things that you really want to dedicate your 
1443.09,1450.86, a lot of people actually get to this point if you ask him about it but they don't get to the next two points on our notes number two
1450.86,1452.45, to follow it
1452.93,1458.9, go follow your passion don't just leave these things on a list actually do them
1459.8,1463.82, trombone once said every one is dreams
1463.91,1471.47, some people put their dreams in a box and every once in a while they opened the box and say yet still i brains they're still in there
1472.16,1473.96, just leave them on a list
1474.14,1478.97, do that look the bible says give ourselves completely to god
1479.0,1491.57, since you've been given new life and use your whole body as a tool to do what's right for the glory of god it's about discipline and actually doing it so here's the question
1491.69,1494.66, how can i specifically
1494.66,1497.96, sue the items i circled
1498.32,1501.83, don't slip your nose over the page to go back to page one
1502.01,1509.3, where that question is at the bottom of the outside one i want you to take your pen or pencil and put a little star by that question
1509.99,1514.97, just prick your finger with your pen and put some blood by that question okay
1515.42,1518.36, that is the most difficult question of the day
1518.9,1523.82, it's one thing to have this last these would be my bucket listen as an acute right these things down
1524.36,1549.2, it's a whole other thing to say this is what i've got to change to live my life as if i'm dying now can you stay in point one because i want to stand this question is this is what it's all about here i'll give you an example of one of the things that made it to the short list for me i already told you one of the things that i listen quality time with my kids we have three kids agitation up fast
1549.29,1555.92, this is you know an item with a bullet on my list here spent quality time with my kids that's good but that's general
1556.22,1563.96, so you go to this question how can i specifically pursue the items i circled i wrote down some things
1564.47,1569.54, i want to give you an example of some specific action steps number one i wrote
1569.66,1572.69, follow up questions to their answers
1573.14,1581.78, would be helpful a lot of times all ask my family questions and they'll give you an answer and i'll go and you know back to my wits chocolate warned
1582.44,1587.33, to shut down my internal dialogue of me
1587.39,1589.34, listening to their answer
1589.82,1595.52, me answering the question in my mind before they say it out loud i just need to learn to be a better listener
1595.55,1603.47, this is all action steps under one item of my bucket list which has spent more quality to with my kids number two
1603.56,1608.27, don't get on the computer to work until the kids go to bed
1609.98,1616.16, i'm going to write that sermon your twin lakes i'm dying this is my last sermon i'm not going to do it until they're a bad
1616.34,1619.07, not going to take time away from them
1619.34,1625.4, i say yes to all the bad do you want to question
1626.42,1627.68, about
1628.34,1638.75, i love to read where a family of red holes and sometimes tell a lot of fire in the living room and they be reading and there and my year older and eighteen year old will say

1642.47,1644.9, coming just read by the fire
1644.9,1647.93, often i say busy right now

1804.77,1833.63, they relate to this my motions get numb my soul starts to dry up i quit living with passion and the thing is in my own worst enemy on this i just sort of naturally gravitate to an overcrowded schedule and seems to be the way i made anybody like me on this you naturally gravitate to too much stuff in your schedule anybody right now i feel like i am wiped out i can't there's not enough time in the day to get everything done anybody related to that how many of you are actually two tired even raise your hands right now that's what i could
1833.66,1841.43, look at our jesus field in his passion i love these verses very early in the morning while it was still dark
1841.55,1843.11, jesus got up
1843.2,1848.09, let the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed
1848.3,1856.52, so and then i love to simon and his companions went to look for him and when they found him he exclaimed every one looking for you
1856.88,1859.01, and jesus replied
1859.1,1861.92, now there are still needs that i'm not filling
1862.49,1868.76, people in letting down i feel so guilty where are they living please do everything they ask of me no that's not what he says
1869.24,1876.92, perfect son of god says let's go somewhere else 
1877.7,1879.62, you love that
1879.89,1884.45, a prize is saying i got to find some place they can't get to me
1884.78,1887.72, edison
1888.11,1891.08, don't feel guilty about it get rest
1891.59,1894.86, exercise get away
1895.52,1908.15, most important get time with god i love this translation of philoctetes and seven just as you trusted in christ to save you
1908.93,1911.57, trust him to for each day's problems
1912.35,1916.73, some reason that was to outside and connect early in my christian life
1917.18,1918.86, this first just
1919.04,1923.81, a whole new level when i realize what this meant live in vital union with him
1924.47,1935.24, your roots grow down into him and drop up nourishment from him go on growing in the lord and become strong and vigorous
1935.54,1943.73, the talking about specifically again the question is what needs to change in my life to really feel my passion
1944.39,1984.5, i grew up strong and vigorous when you do the kinds of things jesus did in those verses you get away you spent time with god and one of the things that i love about this series is because we're challenging you every day to spend time with god we got the daily devotions attached to the sermon which i encourage you all to do it kind of you through the process of making this circling the crucial items but we also have this one motionless
1985.19,1986.9, not just some
1987.23,1991.85, my brain up there in the universe the bible says god is love
1991.97,2000.13, passionate and so when you spend time with a passion a god you find that you get more passionate to
2000.76,2011.47, i can't wait to see what happens in this series as we go through it during these weeks i think god's goin to do miracles in marriages miracles in
2011.56,2021.22, lives he's got going to enrich souls i can't wait to hear what he's going to do through this church in the community i am very stout it but now let me close with this thought
2021.46,2024.94, in with passion is great
2025.24,2031.51, the bible says there is one thing that is even better than that to leave it or not
2031.99,2035.44, the apostle paul talked about it he said for me
2035.71,2039.22, i mean living for christ and
2039.55,2042.55, dying is even better
2042.94,2052.06, i can say that this is such a great cure for those of you who are not all the hedges thinking of your own death pauline i know my time's limited and i love living
2052.39,2055.0, i live with joy
2055.15,2066.7, in the book that this is a from the whole book is about how he lives with joy every day you rejoices every day lizbeth joy but he goes his joyful as my life is now dying even better
2067.06,2072.43, i say that because he knows that when he dies he will be with the object of his passion
2072.67,2075.67, with the one who passionately loves him
2075.85,2080.02, jesus christ see all godly passion
2080.17,2084.58, starts with understanding god's passion for me
2085.42,2088.81, the bible says god is passionate for you
2089.38,2097.15, so passionate for you he came to earth and suffered and died for your sins to save you
2097.75,2099.67, the whole bible is about
2100.06,2104.47, that's what that's the story that this church is here to tell
2105.16,2110.38, not just here to try to convince you to believe that a god exists
2110.38,2115.63, i don't know whether believing that a god exists is going to make that much difference to your life
2115.96,2119.17, churches about something much different than that
2119.59,2128.53, about allowing you to sense to tap into experience to fill yourself the object of the passion
2128.8,2132.07, the god who exists
2132.4,2135.04, we started with a clip from the
2135.04,2137.8, bucket list and i want to end with one
2138.37,2149.86, the clip from that move edward and carter create their list together and since edward is a multimillionaire conveniently for the plot of the movie money is no object
2150.25,2173.14, in this little scene there optimism of the things on their list and they are flying over the polar ice cap indescribable in over the floor canoeist
2173.56,2175.21, the stars
2175.48,2179.44, really one of the guards cooks
2181.06,2184.18, so 
2184.18,2188.17, in a begging of some sort in all his
2188.95,2190.45, you don't
2190.87,2192.1, i mean
2192.25,2203.11, he is a look up in the sky promised their servant the big bay all this goin
2203.83,2214.39, it was the people neither solitude any inanely five per cent of the people are always wrong called faith
2214.72,2242.98, and people who have faith in iskanderun it may be your head than the way cartilages these discussions and every one of them always hits the same one is there diaculum fairy or not and nobody has ever got now that to
2243.37,2245.11, do you believe
2245.77,2253.45, he resists the big ben reunies
2255.19,2263.8, we wear the buron and round to it
2265.84,2278.92, i love to be wrong i ran i went that suit works that way
2278.92,2283.99, some claiming it to something i don't
2284.08,2287.59, i do attach
2288.58,2290.26, that is a fascinating 
2290.98,2293.62, a lot of points for discussion there
2294.4,2299.14, but first i think carter is absolutely right i don't think it works that way
2300.16,2302.77, i think you need to decide now
2303.19,2305.35, you have life
2306.28,2310.6, but second and finally i think one thing edward just didn't get
2311.29,2312.25, that
2312.31,2315.97, believing in god is about so much more than
2316.0,2320.05, whether or not some supreme being exists
2320.53,2323.5, about receiving his passion for you
2323.86,2326.74, love for you to day
2327.67,2333.1, belief is so important you know he said i firmly resist all beliefs
2333.58,2335.83, unbelief is costly
2336.55,2339.85, i did a funeral yesterday for present
2340.3,2341.77, yes old
2341.8,2355.63, she passed away a godly woman she was one of our deaconesses many hundreds of you who her every one who better said she was so kind and so tender hearted so compassionate so serene and graceful and sweet
2355.96,2357.4, she get that way
2357.46,2361.27, i preached her funeral yesterday with her bible in my hand
2361.36,2366.58, kinds of things she wrote in her bible and on one page one thing she highlighted
2367.36,2368.65, it was this
2368.68,2372.04, the most costly thing to us
2372.37,2373.96, unbelief
2375.22,2377.44, most costly thing to us
2378.01,2380.47, unbelief that is so profound
2381.64,2383.53, belief
2384.04,2386.65, rob you of so much
2387.49,2390.55, believe leads to cynicism
2391.18,2407.41, belief can rob you of passionate unbelief brings hopelessness on believe just costs too much and i think one of the things that made christie was was that she understood that and determined to believe 
2407.5,2411.64, even through the tough times and she had plenty she believed
2412.06,2414.52, she believed that god at a purpose for her
2414.64,2416.08, she believed that
2416.38,2424.99, had amazing plans for life but most of all she believed that god had passionate love for her
2425.47,2428.74, when you believe that really believe that
2428.8,2433.21, that belief can truly change everything
2433.54,2438.01, and help you live a life with greater passion than you've ever imagined
2438.79,2441.7, and prayer before a passionate god right now
2442.6,2446.5, heavenly father thank you for your love for us
2446.53,2458.89, and i just want to pray for every single one of us lord that we would over the next few weeks in this series really just become the procreated us to be with the passions that you gave us

2473.83,2475.45, i don't know how
2476.02,2482.65, pray that they would pray that prayer that even some of jesus's followers pretend the bible lord we believe
2482.8,2484.87, help our unbelief
2485.23,2486.46, a good prayer

2494.44,2501.79, come into my life i want you within my life forgive me of my sense as best i know how i want you to be the lord of my life
2502.24,2508.18, we honestly got sometimes i doubt and unbelief also mixed in all it together and there
2508.54,2518.47, help me through this series to find firmer reasons to live with passion for you and with you in my life
2519.07,2522.58, lord i pray for every single one of us that you would just do
2522.61,2525.04, miracles in our lives
2525.88,2532.51, we realize our days are numbered and so we want to save these good days you have given us
