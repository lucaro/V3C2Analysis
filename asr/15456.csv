0.81,93.42, a beautiful picture of what god is accomplished even in us and so night and talk about that my name is josh martin and i'm one of the pastors here resonate and this summer were going to a series where we tell you a story in our life that i was met by the scriptures and how we were never the same after that so the right truth met with the right time has left us in a place where we've been changed for ever and so in order to do that tell you a little bit of my story my mother had when she was nineteen years old and was not married i do not know my biological father at all even out three times in thirty years i don't know his middle name my married a man on when i was earsplitting outboard
93.42,154.5, we go to court because my dad is going to adopt me and they told me that he wasn't my dad when i was probably twelve years old i remember seeing my birthright i was eight years old and there was a blank spot or the dad's name was supposed to be in that creation confusion and so they had walked with me through all this but when i was sixteen years old he went to court and we filled up all the papers and we got into the court room and basically had to stand before the judge and the judge looked at me and as a sixteen year old and said so do you want to be adopted and i said yes sir i would like to be adopted and i looked at my father and said and do you bear the responsibilities protect him provide for this young man is if he is your own and my father said yes and in the big gable remember at sixteen years old slams and from that moment on i am fundamentally legally inherently different so my last name is changed my burst of catching my driver's license changes my inheritance changes
154.62,158.76, a year old so so i have a different last name
158.79,246.63, as a year old on a senior in high school and my dad comes to the high school and tells me that he and mammertine a divorce and so at that time he was going to move to a town a little bit away from where we live so that he could be closer to his work but he was still going to come around and my adoption didn't change but that did something i mean that shattered something in me if you will that it was very foundation had secured had some foundation pendleton to them so at sixteen i adopted at seventeen the divorce and then i go into college with a very unstable foundation under my feet a very skeptical heart initiate weird now cause my parents don't share things are not together any more and that was conflicting internally for me and i read something anglische four that that summer and something happened in my thought about god differently because of glocester for it and i had to really thought about that before and hadn't heard about that much before but going into that summer when i read that text it kinsington
246.72,282.9, so what does it mean to be saved is our intermediary class and in this class we talk about all sorts of different doctrines that that affected my head but none of them really landed in my heart so we talked about propitiation expiation sanctification regeneration all the actions ransom and atonement and all these really powerful beautiful pictures of what it means to be saved by god and then something happened one of those classes my professor turned to a chapter in a book by jake called now in god and turned a glacier for and said i want to talk to you to day
283.05,288.42, the doctrine of adoption of light an
288.63,306.24, you say the doctrine of adoption that heard that before gianforte read some tabulations for and so he opens the scripture in sareel me about adoption and i remember he said if if you were to introduce god to your friends you could introduce god
306.33,309.75, the one who is the father to the fatherless
309.87,349.8, this is god as he is he is a father to the fatherless and we went on to talk about what it means to walk in adoption as god your father and we heard stories about people who adopt another people even in our church who have adopted their two enter church been adopted we started to see the picture of the gospel in adoption and so you would see parents that go get the kid over seas in the first thing you do in adoption of ernesto the first thing you do if the babies too young and can't speak for themselves or or do anything for themselves the first thing you do is you take their clothes off and you give it out to the orphanage and you put new clothes on them
350.01,364.26, what a picture of the gospel that the first act of adoption is a change of clothes and if the child is old enough to to coherently understand what's happening and say eight nine ten years old you asked the child do you want to be adopted
364.5,397.83, i remember like a i was asked that when i was and so we started exploring what it means to look at god as your father and the doctrine of adoption became more and more powerful to me and as i began to study it i learned that the tissues been left out of my upbringing but it was actually the fundamental identity of what it means to be a christian so here's some quotes there's a guy named john murray who says adoption is the apex of the redemptive grace and privilege amariocapana we're going to put on the screen
397.86,399.9, about adoption it says this
400.2,423.63, adoption is the highest privilege that the gospel offers even higher than justification justifications that we are right with god because what crisis accomplished now we are no longer guilty but cries made way for us to know god so even higher than that adoption is higher because of the rich relationship with god that it involves
423.69,425.55, what is a christian
425.85,431.22, answer i know is that a christian is one who has god as his father
431.55,435.24, you want to know how well a person understands christianity
435.39,451.53, how much he makes of the thought of being god's child and having goddesses father if this is not the thought that prompts and controls his worship in prayers and his whole outlook on life it means that he does not understand christianity very well at all
452.1,455.91, there is no greater miracle or privilege
455.94,460.56, adopted into the family of god and this stirred something in me
460.56,474.66, god had sent his son to make us brothers that that should be something the evening that we do not take lightly that should be something that does not make us yawn and say okay josh i've heard that before this should overwhelm us but the truth is this has been left out
474.81,478.86, the few you've heard a sermon on adoption i had not
478.95,484.8, about few of you had really thought much about adoption most theology books leave adoption out
485.19,507.78, you go through similar you go through these types of books and you'll find that there's paragraphs there are subjects for there's not chapters there's not massive works of theology on the doctrine of adoption but this is the central picture theayter fundamentally powerful and privilege than that of justification
508.05,512.13, because of what it means and the outworking of our lives
512.43,516.81, and the reason why i think this is so powerful as this his identity on a 
517.05,549.18, so the opposite of not recognizing your adopted as recognizing i don't know who i am and that's all i recognize i don't know why am which could lead to words base righteousness god's probably mad at me because i don't know who i am he probably doesn't ainsworth by my works instead of working from your identity which is you have been adopted and brought in to a family and therefore you move forward out of that identity this word adoption who these cain the greek is only his five times in the nicest
549.45,584.97, this picture of adoption so i want you guys to grab your bible and turn to glacier for that was all introduction and we're going to educate and i want to explain to you something that was tattoo as i possibly can so if you have something a right with you pulled that out we always have place in the program where you can write notes but there's me a lot of stuff on the screen i want you guys to stay with me this whole time to galatians chapter four
585.18,588.9, evening we're going to ponder the privilege of adoption together
589.2,596.28, we're going to look and see paul what do you mean by that what does that mean for us as children who have been adopted glaciers chapter four
596.55,598.32, for
601.92,614.61, but when the fullness of time had come god sent forth his son born of a woman born under the law to redeem those who are under the law so that we might receive adoption
614.91,645.33, sense and because you are sons god sent the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father so you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then you are an heir through god so as best we can we go look at four verses the night and not go very wide but as deep as possible so we're going to start with the definition of adoption so from ingred's emetic theology he defines adoption as this
645.45,653.07, act of god whereby he makes us members of his family an active god
653.16,666.21, an active god not an active as an active god whereby he not us whereby he makes us members of his family so adoption is an act of god whereby he makes us members of his family
666.39,678.33, i have eight points to night and i hope you're excited about that i've never given you a point some not even sorry for this you any point of one hero usually like two points so you got sick show me some grace to night
678.72,714.0, good this is so good so you're not even going to be mad at the end it's going to be great point imbroglios chapter for adoption is planned but when the fullness of time had come beresfords but when the fulness of time had come this is intentional language is a perfect timing some of us think manichees was born now like a follow on twitter and we could outalisso and get all these people behind him then not apparently many of us would say it be better if he was born now he partly not
714.48,742.8, he says that at the appointed time this is a powerful picture of a pin this is intentional language that god sent the sun at the appropriate time and the father then sent the spirit at the appropriate time so so if you if you know your history there are some all that was coming in and needed to be fulfilled there was a yearning for a saviour so at just the right time god sent forth his son marriage sorry adoption is a plan
743.01,745.35, if you know my wife and i
745.5,754.41, you know that we want to we wanted to have a baby and we tried for a while may be prayed for us and honestly it's a month to pregnant
754.5,766.59, and so when it takes you months to get pregnant you start to think o well maybe this isn't going to happen should we look into adoption i want to say very very openly with you adoption was never planned for an
767.1,789.57, we always wanted to adopt i remember his talking even before we got married and i was like one o bring this up because at some point i want to adopt a start talking about adoption as she started talking about adoption and i'm likevise breaker for me and she's like no no hang on this in the deal breaker for me you don't want to adopt you can't marry me and i'm like i don't gennadius we had like the steel breaker fight like both of us want the same thing and we're fighting because we both want the same thing but we both wanted to say at first
789.75,826.29, it's fine about it and so this was never an issue biology for us to was always an issue of theology like i always understood this is what happened to me and the james says true religion but sure religion is looking after the over looking after the powerless going and servants to this was always in my heart and in my head but after it takes a while to get pregnant you start thinking well maybe this is going to go for it so even if grannie went to our house you would do it opened the drawer next to our desk and you would see four or five or six i can't remember how many packets of like forty pages of of adoption agency information
826.62,854.19, the plan that stuff like you need to be years old and have been married five years which for us landed this june so two months ago a month ago that that was now were available to adopt now by god's grace we are pregnant and that is so exciting for us so so we are going to have a natural baby but that is not mean we're going to stop the plan for adoption so adoption is a plan and you are going to have to plan accordingly number two
854.31,856.26, adoption requires
856.65,858.63, the right qualifications
860.49,866.73, second part of our sports as when the fullness of time had come god sent forth his son
868.41,873.21, there is only one who is qualified to adopt us into the family of god
873.84,896.1, anyone could adopt but god sent forth his son jesus the pre eminent son born of a woman duel nature the fact that jesus was fully god the fact that he was fully man he was fully divined fully human on jesus to nature mysteries of mysteries which would make simple questions very complex for jesus jesus how old are you
896.1,908.4, a man on my mother's side in twelve mo father satiate nal a my mother's side i get thirsty on my father's side in the living water
908.61,920.01, my mother's side i get hungry on my father's side i am the bread of life on my mother's side have nowhere to lay my head on my father's side the earth is mine and everything in it
920.22,942.15, these are complex questions for jesus there is only one who is qualified there will never be another jesus he is the only qualified one to lead us to adoption jesus's twelve years old in the temple and they get he is left behind his family leave him when they come back they say where were you and he said didn't you know it would be at my father's house
942.81,948.03, and every one said who year old jesus i didn't mean that did you
948.15,969.57, father's house i don't know the last time you hung out with year olds but they miss speak sometimes so we're going to count that as a miser old and then he keeps going on through his life and then when he's at his baptism you see him going under by his cousin john baptizing and you hear a booming voice from heaven we god the father assassin whom i love and am well pleased with him
969.75,985.65, spirit descended the powerful picture of the trinity god of firms with cristel and then you fast for a little bit longer the disciples say teaches how to pray jesus and jesus as when you pray pray like this are father
986.16,990.27, year old jesus did you to say our father
990.45,1001.73, call away the god of the covenant the god of abraham isaac and jacob the jew just say he is your father to which jesus could have said yes and i'm qualified to do that
1002.69,1012.08, and i qualified to tell the disciples you pray like that too because there's a day coming when he is actually going to happen and it's going to be sooner than you think when i give my life
1012.11,1015.26, from the dead so there is one qualified
1015.92,1017.42, name
1017.72,1020.45, adoption is costly
1022.88,1028.25, he was born under the law to redeem those under the law
1028.46,1034.52, the last half of verse was born under the law to redeem those under the law
1034.76,1040.7, that is a very fancy way of saying that adoption cost christ his life
1041.33,1059.96, when he was born he was born under the law that crushed us so that he could fulfil that law stand up under that law hold that law to its fullness and then give his life away so that you and i might not have to pay the costs the christ paid a cost for us he kept the law that would crush us
1059.96,1069.5, we wouldn't be crushed and he took a crushing so that we wouldn't be crushed i hope that tonight we realize that our adoption cost christ his blood
1069.92,1072.14, cost crisis life
1072.5,1084.56, in a physical adoption you know for international adoption it cost things to adopt and there is an understanding even in the scriptures of a spiritual cost
1085.25,1089.27, the jesus came down and would be our great hero
1089.33,1096.2, as a big brother i guess i'll say it like this there's no one naturally born into the family of god
1097.19,1108.86, a big brother who made us available made a success will make god availed me god accessible so that we would know him and it was an incredibly costly thing so much so that christ should be our great hero
1109.58,1111.71, because the option was costly
1112.43,1121.73, they were most halfway there he goes exciting like come on we get him points all right great you can only have a point of before
1122.54,1135.44, engineers are like men i love this keep this an dumdrum i cannot pointer but option save children from terrible situations
1136.34,1144.11, adoption save children from terrible situation and galicia chapter four verses formerly you did not know god
1144.89,1146.87, rance slaved
1147.41,1167.72, to a nature that made you serve another guy so formerly didn't know him you are a slave to another nature adoption save children from terrible terrible situations even if you look at the picture of a physical adoptions there's not a much sadder place in all the earth in an orphanage is there
1168.2,1205.76, there's not a much sadder place the open is that only houses three year olds and younger because a lot of times those babies don't even cry any more because no one ever responded to when they cry so there an airyplane the plight of an orphan is not a pretty plight the script handed to orphans is not a pretty script of no birth they parted there no daddy daughter date sees no pictures on the wall there's no identity in those kids there is nothing about them that would be special because no one's calling them special ones coming to them and bring me out of them so adoption save children from terrible terrible situations
1206.48,1210.23, and the main one who saves in this picture is the father
1210.41,1215.45, i give you a brief definition of what it means to be a father
1215.69,1224.6, the definition of a father is one who gladly bears the responsibility to protect them provide for his family
1225.05,1261.65, definition of a father is one who gladly bears the responsibility to protect and provide for his family so when i say adoption save kids from horrible situations what i mean is the god the father took the responsibility on himself for the mess we've made to reconcile us to himself he could not leave us on our own he could not leave us in a terrible situation without intervening because he is responsible he gladly bear the responsibility to protect and provide for the orphans to call us now sons
1261.95,1266.03, on november tenth lord willing we will have a baby girl
1266.27,1286.91, and when our baby girl is here and she is getting older and able to make messes of her own and i hope for that it's going to be fun times for me but listen i'm already preparing to the best of my bill i have no idea what this is going to be like but the best i can in preparing myself to gladly bear the responsibility to protect and provide
1287.39,1300.65, in other words if i see my daughter and a terrible situation nothing inside me is going to cross my arms and say good luck with that baby girl i hope that goes well for you
1300.86,1313.1, if she has been taken advantage of her being here or of being a bully or abused or sultan anything like a horrible thing that could happen a father would never say you figure that out luck with that
1313.31,1328.55, no any father in the world any man even just watching that would get involved in intervening give his life on behalf of the protection and provision of the kid and i am a nobody father i'm a nobody father
1328.76,1334.19, just the guy trying to be a dead and can you imagine that picture would it comes to our heavenly father
1335.03,1340.7, he would not leave us on our own he would not sit back and cross his arms and the good luck with that
1340.94,1351.14, do you realize the identity inside of you that makes you a son or daughter of god therefore you would be protected adoption saves
1351.32,1353.42, from terrible situations
1354.32,1356.36, god has come to our aid
1356.63,1361.94, intimidation involves a legal change
1362.87,1370.01, i really hope you're right this down because this is identity one i want you want to know who you are i have a point there like a thousand of these are rodents
1370.01,1373.88, adoption involves a legal change
1374.27,1405.08, a transfer that takes place at no one can revoke you are let me say like this at three you are not identified as a son and the adoption process and at the ardent as a son in the adoption process you were not legally able to access all of this goodness in a father can provide and at three sixteen you're not legally able to excess all that is yours the gavel has slammed
1405.23,1406.85, your life
1407.21,1408.89, hope you get that
1408.98,1418.04, then one can come against you no accuser could come against you romancer it says nothing can separate you from the love of god that in christ jesus because there has been a legal change
1418.4,1420.14, the highest of courts
1420.44,1432.68, given by the highest of authority so much so that it could never be reversed there has been a legal change pointer six adoption grants us
1433.16,1435.26, spirit of sonship
1436.22,1443.99, adoption grant us the spirit of sonship truth is most of you could care less about point number five because it's paperwork
1444.35,1468.47, i have a legal status change in you go cool you have any more points to i thought you were going to give me a good ones i don't really like five that much i didn't write it down okay but point number six is so much more significant because you go legal kind of get it but that isn't feel like anything pontbriand the spirit of sonship and other words you belong
1469.1,1502.73, feel that you part of a family you are in and there's nothing that you've done that made you earn being in and there's nothing you can do to give you push out of being in you belong so much of the spirit of christ is in you crying out for you abaft that's the best the dearest nearest possible way that you could say father somebody even say i translate as dead or a dadant language its only other ifs the few other times in all the scripture one of them is in the garden against simony
1503.09,1505.7, and she's as cristofer
1506.57,1508.37, i belong
1508.61,1522.86, in a family i don't know where you're going through but they should affect the way you go through that because you belong should affect the way you pray they should affect the way you look in the mirror and the way you view your self and your life you are covered
1523.37,1543.38, god who loves you and wants to protect and provide for you you were in so much so this is what it means to be in when you are called a son you have the covering of god the father the big brother jesus walking alongside you in the holy prior god internally and dwelling in you to lead you you are son and that should mean something to us
1543.56,1546.8, we are in point amusement
1548.09,1553.25, adoption transforms us in every way
1554.84,1557.36, adoption transforms us in everywhere
1558.92,1581.27, i don't know how to say this without using feeling language but i'll be honest with you a lot of the christian life is is whether or not i feel like god loves me or rather not i feel like i'm doing enough so if i sent last night i'm going to come to church to day monarchian nitentes during the sermon so that god will love me again
1581.54,1598.19, there's this problem and the story of christian saw a battle of words base righteousness if i try hard god will love me if i work harder god will love me when you realize this truth when you realize that adoption transforms you in every way but what i mean is this
1598.67,1603.44, you can therefore you can repent
1603.92,1607.85, without feeling the fear of being kicked out of the house
1608.33,1627.77, your parents i understand this illustration a little better you want to teach your children when you break something when you heard something when you do something wrong come to me without fear that i'm going to kick you out of the house because i'm not going to kick you out of the house you're in the house therefore that security that feeling of safeness a feeling of home he should feel like in the church
1628.01,1629.96, when you feel that
1630.11,1632.09, can be transformed by the
1632.99,1635.27, adoption is forever language
1635.51,1642.5, nothing you could do and push you out this is the story of the prodigal son who runs away and while he still far off the father pursues him
1642.95,1655.19, father is not in the house cooking dinner and when the sun bangs on the door he goes out don't have a son any more in her now you're in there's permanent transformed you there's a forever security in the identity given in adoption
1656.36,1657.65, a point
1658.01,1660.98, adoption gives the child
1661.88,1663.65, the right to be an air
1665.12,1668.09, adoption give the child the right to be an air
1670.49,1674.63, when it says in verse because your sons
1675.14,1681.05, he said the spirit of his son than you to cry be father verses you are no longer a slave
1681.32,1686.96, a son and a son the new are an heir through god
1688.16,1697.79, so we have an inheritance coming to us i do not know what this looks like i do not know how this is going to work itself out the best is still to come that's all i know
1698.21,1711.08, there's an inheritance coming that one day in the end because we are a part of the family we will be with god for ever so i spent at points trying to tell you your identity so that i could say this to you
1711.8,1724.4, good news of the gospel the gospel the good news that brought us to cry so the good news of the good news you ready for this the good news of the good news as they in the end we got to be with god for ever
1725.24,1726.83, a father
1727.16,1732.71, as a protector as a provider we had to be with god for ever in a place
1732.77,1734.39, has no chance
1734.78,1743.93, no train or car rick playing crashes hurt fear trouble any of these things we get to be with god
1746.9,1751.85, none of this is this is hard for some because maybe some you have great debts
1752.12,1772.61, you hear the sermon go i have a great dad so that whole father language ye get that great i took notes because you told me to some of you are in this middle ground we you're like i actually have a horrible dating as daon't even know what that means the french
1773.33,1778.97, a lot of horrible fathers forgot why in the world that you choose the word father
1779.03,1785.18, explain yourself to a world that is generally growing more and more fatherless
1785.87,1805.01, and so it's hard for you to understand god as a father because you never had a father over here it's hard for you to understand god as a father because you already had a great father and there's some of you over here the go i don't even know how to think of god as my father because i've never allowed christ to be the one that brings me into the family
1806.15,1809.66, and so similarly to me is a year old
1810.53,1818.39, some you might say man will how do i get this and again he is a year old you have to get to respond to the question do you want to be adopted
1818.87,1826.79, and if you can respond to that question with yeah yeah would like that the now that you have a yes from the father coming back your way
1827.6,1829.49, i don't say this
1830.03,1844.43, and in a way that would make you think man i need to earn that somehow or or my being too bad i could never be adopted because i'm too bad or i i'm good enough now martin listen canonisation
1846.8,1849.65, the more broken the better in some ways
1850.16,1856.85, the more broken we are the more god has found us and john and to his family
1857.45,1861.26, soon closed by reading one last text to you
1862.07,1870.38, and this may felt luxury and unnoticeable of information but if we get that if we talk about that in village and that starts to make its way into the way we view the world
1870.62,1872.63, will affect us
1872.93,1889.31, and this doctrine is not been talked about enough so i hope you get that to night i want to read this to you just so you know that god has been adopting since the beginning it was always in motion even of the book jose waseche eleven says this when israel was a child i loved him
1889.7,1892.1, and out of egypt i called my son
1892.43,1897.05, the more i called after israel the further they ran away from me
1898.49,1920.57, god has been pursuing us in the housecarles is but we've always run away and so it's a night here's what i hope that you do i hope that you if if you're follower christ you listen to this and you go manhattan helps me recognise my identity and if you're not a follower cristatus an that sounds like a really good situation that i would like to know more about

1951.56,1977.42, so the band sings whether going to do as they're going to sing over us and then if you're herennius like to talk to someone about what it means to be adopted mother's going to be in the back and he would love to talk to you and if you are already a follower of christ and you get this and you've heard this i want you to celebrate the fact that you are in the family of goodness
1977.81,1984.65, and as you come forward to take communion as you break off the bread and dip it into the juice recognize that your adoption was costly
1985.61,1998.87, and then a lot of that cost we should worship as people who are in and who are worshipping a father and a far off god and a distant deity but father
