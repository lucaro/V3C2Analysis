3.27,11.91, i was going to start with a coat that i find here to day from tony rachel when he was interviewed and treat of camera bag of tonality years
12.12,13.68, and that
14.07,18.42, said my miscount something of the spirit and the mentality of the english
18.57,20.46, in the way of life
20.67,27.96, that exists in the way they do things or between the traditions and partly to natural their environment and mentality
28.41,38.49, there's something about especially about the english way of life teleostei wish to record it from my particular point of view before it becomes americanized and disappeared
38.64,41.61, the interesting were to 
41.73,48.33, in the way the talk about your work miscalls be tollemache said he succeeded olive
48.42,61.71, i think so very much to me that was his great ability it was to show us show the vulnerability of the sort of slightly santos the english and despite the fact that we have become incredibly more americanized in the earth and he
61.71,75.21, solita englishness is still let evidently a very myself to her english the english art and for ample partly inspired by looking through tenderness
75.21,78.12, where he went to all the events in the season
78.15,89.1, pick up a commission from the table which is in the orifice by the way where i went specifically and looked all the english seas and events and interestingly if he went to them
89.22,118.98, most of them you wouldn't actually know really the difference between them for years ago thirty years ago ten years ago beaver in time the things and they are incredibly interesting incredibly fascinating animals very good things to feign it not by any means the only too for the but it was very good to tom or my other class or if you like by polydores and before i venturously i mean can you tell me a little bit about how you first came in contact with his work and
119.16,138.09, it was such a sort of big ordinance on well i was at college nostradama school and the head of craftily survived critical age i decided i want to be toromon's person coming siddhattha in the first place so that the age of fourteen or fifteen
138.3,168.84, i decided to do so he surprised in his magazine and there i discovered the pictures of lefrenier brother frank go when the granulation of sixty or together and then when i went to masterpiece billows also the editor of critical claim round game at all and one of the people who talk about a great length was tineton suddenly i saw at these pictures which always had the sort of space shall feel and look on these american photographers but actually done in england i couldn't believe
168.93,177.99, point them how compelling these foregather and immediately became now a huge fan and convert to his way of looking and thinking
178.05,191.88, two years after that he acted so i never met him he was back in the states of course i was a constant but i think it was seeing those photographs way back and simply on that readypenny eyes to
191.88,219.24, he was the interesting connection between these two ideas is a went and joined the broad eristic about sixty five and all the things that he learns about the model language of forty which i was also soaking from the pages of predicate had learnt because he was in that whole group he met when a grand merits although street tootsies and he soon like outsail way of looking at life
219.48,245.85, thinking about the street is a theater and as much constrain on the gap between people as the people themselves and the umbrella back and translated it into it like the beach something resolute furioso he if you like to one of the strong sanderson american soapy and made a new one by reinventing echarpe and a course i always love for the office
245.97,254.43, well although i didn't do that seventy particularly it aptly ages but i turned to color and did my last asaroe
254.43,265.56, i think a bridge between the language of american teraphim as taking a sort of soul of that translated england was the thing that got so excited
266.13,303.06, so so to the grave to victory misleading from graphic but bertrand so one nemesianus these a clothespin tell us exactly with that we did you make a boatload then and i was looking onesimus words rather than pictures of course that we read the official blows and and and so on about the exhibition and there was only stuff about how this was a different world that both antigone and not in a photographic in the sixties and seventies and so
303.18,310.65, it isn't thinking well hang on it not these the same people as i've been studying for watching the english you in the early part of the
310.8,343.17, first sentry and and i think it's probably my father going estimates noticias well boringly i followed in his footsteps and he contested assegai dandle and i think if if the past is indeed another country than the mediator of ethnographic daring on her what he meant by that was a kind of blindness to the underlying similarities between cultures he was talking about other than times because one is so dazzled by the
343.26,384.66, the superficial surface differences which can often be quite striking and black my photo the clothes are different the whole astonishment but essentially as far as i could see this in terms of culture and an of character these are the same people as in studying missus the same english character but the insane most proud resuscitation
384.72,482.22, the sort of the commonalities in the english sichlike the things that cut across as reagents social boundaries and i was trying to find the kind of care of englishness i was trying to define englishness if you like and an undefined as pisani should probably back track little bit and say what it is that that i i should have not really improper anthropologists go and study strange tribes in places with nonsensicality problem it is this kind of initiation right that you have to go through deforestation
482.52,514.38, nice she shops and so on with birkebeineren weston industrialized culture is partly that but but not entirely and only artisan a way i don't see why and otisfield they have to go and study strange tribes of bizarreries on mysterious customs when for me the wearisome puzzling faverolles right here on my door step i my own native conversation and the reason i did this book
514.47,535.62, many years was keeping me awake at night that i didn't quite understand english missed everything he was not one of appointing the sorely deeply in to say as he is lying awake at lakewood understand english but if it's true worth
535.65,540.6, festivities of those exterior things an you talking about 
540.69,608.94, i mean there are no people on catholicity of boomfood economical ameliorating the go make a heroic films or in some cases they get their subjects if you like them that the people the society punishes ying to make films of each other and themselves and so on and take photographs not sure i mean i discretion with the reanimating which passing terribly cool itinerant it was martin photographs i was sort of providing text of a eenglish and i kept annoying martin by providing the which was about what the people in the photographs were saying or might be saying in order not sitting there in the rain waiting for something you know that they're all saying bottiaea otherwise
609.06,627.0, because it does well it jumps out at me and i don't know if that's because i've been studying this continuing his national character though i unauthorised therefore which may be logical all having spent so long
627.0,629.61, and photographic english
629.64,665.73, basically he put into words what i attempt to forego is this fundamental thing and i think there are two words i say but i sensibility the english and a sort of pomposity and mining and equity towards him maslov the english and annoyed by the attesting and that ambiguity of course is i hope in the care of a orithyia by the english because the danger is you go into sort of power you end up doing for the gardens looked like parties and at the same time i don't tattersett them so and have some fun because that tolerably
665.79,781.53, which is often ascribed to say the great ability of stalactites or some like any hancock was one of my favourite comedians he was able to disfigure on the composite british old english and so intently that it's that kind of spread is a thing that i am trying to do and that's what you have expressed so well in your book you one reason why started filming example and italieners go was because the antennae you goin moroseness all this is all as like a waste so wyandot attainment i misthink ing not this is all for when i looked at these you know a picture realisation words i've written this four hundred odd page book if i could take photographs i wouldn't have had to i could have done it in but i don't know a thousand i can't do last but anyway whatever it might be it could have been considerably for pages but even now found that you needed the words orate we went to a ginuine of the issues and became a problem for a ewe were so involved in this ponderosities chapel so she was starting to run the sunday school i was doing talks at the elders of a chapel and they're all getting old and dying off mistook our interest as being one that we wanted to carry off an we were basically the justice when he saw the maiden up doing it and that was an error in so far that it was misinterpreted as being spontanee an issue with an particularly elder the end and is in a sense a lesson learned that however much you arnold with a situation or never pass off it was as aoidhu sharing that information and curing of people say is so essential to learning about eating effectively staircase remote
781.53,820.32, comfortable impossible but world yetive upon still you can feel like a bit of an outsider a very middle class and then i wanted to do a body work having done a rural community would have a bridge i therefore classmate last solace pitchers i wanted to do something about my own tribe and went into a project about the middle class in the ages when the porteress we are all children of pathlike even i didn't like his father and part of that was therapeutic whereby is able examined my own background and so of converters of it that
820.89,827.31, still using ambiguity on the contradictions of disraeli and that is a fascinating appeared may because
827.37,843.15, many things about the middle class light light matting or disliked assembly used by prejudices which are always surintendant of the wearer to shooters and by the right subject holocaust of
843.27,846.0, the middle class pictures which he taboo and the ex bishop
846.0,857.04, but mother said i casting and when she thinks themistocles to the seedtime to be led sedentariness patrick time
857.16,864.36, so that's ethically to went to morecambe while i can outsiders and not as formerly
864.87,889.26, castanado was omitted he but he is one of the great advantages of going winnebagos you come and see something is very familiar with the strange eyes so if you have that fantastic combination of the array and nanette point and that i think is essential secrets wile to feignwell the lake sixty having spent fortified years in america
889.38,897.51, and likewise when i came back from the k i was i'd been too obvious in ireland and is coming back to the cosmic more exciting
897.51,900.81, but i returned
900.9,926.1, going leading up the bridge to live in ireland two years a lecherous because the truth they said true insanity i am attracted to her and i guess i always use so as my starting point perhaps within that divertingly imitate twist freshest the same time you know without those peaches without that knowledge of baggage what we know about the size
926.19,928.68, would build a read these pictures and effectively
928.71,939.06, stimulants to the motor every wouldn't be able to find the photograph take us on lesage missionaries
939.06,1020.69, i mean one thing is interesting i have a much bigger career in france and one reason why i do that is because they perceive is pulling the leg of the english and the acres that a lot of even the english so that is one reason why a man the robber historical things like the light toppleton's one reason why i go down better in france but buttoned his protestations of hopetoun be showing the wollastons a balance eglosilyan me that you know you go to the beach sarsaparilla wars and famines and the show squaretoes the full of equality to a certain degree that is not question because it's perfect nothing to do you know that is what petesuchos the world surely in the sense of your asking about the reality of whom what we are and why were fully opting that as questionable as going to a supine heliotropes wellgood and shows shoryobune stonehaven sethos cooeperate the same time you bring something new to it never that's why always attractive show some ideas prosecutions why all went round you looking countries she just try to follow up the leeches
1020.75,1064.88, and that was quite a lot of fun because i was starting about clitherow you have to identify them and then find them for example in england you know the bulletholes one as she really hard by inadvertence show or notoriety but you go in here anyway because if you you know marinette of being too too cruel to be anxious of of an even though i actually eviction english throughout this book in one is one time you sing in praise of english and i a insofar it amassed sort of anti arthritism thing of tractoration of positive on this 
1064.88,1074.03, now we have this sort of habit of national self adulation and i only get taken to task when i actually say something nice about english
1074.09,1102.5, then everybody comes down on me but this body weseloff in like a man about everything antediluvian doesn't take a certain tametomo with a black and white thing about me i am talking to joe to moreton to stevenson the busiest thing about the forgetful them
1103.22,1110.18, particularly when states work with show and america in as open he set a text
1110.39,1118.76, how someone something at the time no one wants to say it but tony is later and subtly becomes clanton under manesse hing lagoon here
1119.06,1130.7, they generally bottom the canyon big show the adamites always been appreciated i mean his obiter bigger platform
1130.7,1138.89, the exhibition he never had strangely a pictorial is sanartia large thing ahint
1138.98,1148.04, he's probably you know how my france other countries in the so that we corrected that dispatch is welcome acourse
1148.73,1160.13, but the motion of mutilation the come look at these photographs without the prison of the political well there is a mean person is a black and white fame have to explain that in those days in the seventies
1160.13,1163.82, i copestone induction really got going
1163.94,1167.48, the late when suddenly the lights are sure and there is
1167.48,1177.17, in museum shows and probably more so than those two estates famous show over and so he sits and that gave the standard for the art world but of
1177.29,1180.41, well to say that colonel be serious then
1180.44,1215.72, you know when i was starting on black and white was sentient and so in the in the athanase and that was partly inspired by the movement of these osochar being taken seriously and one i know to tolerate so everlastin white pitchers to have moroseful ever heals save exonerate time esperanto and rashness of possiet has to show the color inessential part of literation of
1215.87,1232.61, the world is as potential so much and sustained when you enamelled point your right but recently that me the biggest position the last decay is being therefore years wore on the black country on the east coming
1232.82,1271.97, from making a film about but full of pensioners who going from wolverhampton to westermann tinsel a five day trip some immediately going back by breakfast time to morrow be back on the millisent four years foregoing making films about and working with people the black country so attained by working class are in the u adenostoma which is where the people are working with are based probably the least middle class and an old catacombs may it really in terms of middle class served to
1272.09,1274.97, folks to king cottier
1274.97,1277.61, i actually very much enjoying
1277.67,1290.9, there and doing that and making the films of essential part of database the dialogue narrative which you experience is so important the still photographed so thinking forms of her evil
1290.9,1296.06, tell the stories about our coast trip we went into the film about her
1296.15,1330.92, i fancy who sells his pigeon goliar so we needed to have the narrative in such a brilliant story his guide no briefites known in moglich in the back he goes to mongolia he treated as of the it because he had a brilliant pigeonbreasted his honor and his gieshuebler you know he's never seen the like it so is wonderful to experience and witness that and this all be shown in alsace the black country when we do the show and the films be an integral part of the efficient so
1330.98,1335.48, strangely enough the losers are gone back to the atrocities
1335.48,1350.39, i mean one of the seething with short which we should obeisances it's a very young lad for them to rule inside probably before he reached his pinions and he were anticipating more men of wanton
1350.39,1353.21, she was shut by the toleration
1353.33,1361.97, as he did so colorless we know it i imagine he would continue being torterue's very likely seals fill
1362.0,1372.77, i make her he was fascinated by films he watched these a laendler not from them and i imagine had you lived he encounters well
1372.77,1384.02, generation aggregation the various entities to be any had he had an eccentric sense of humor and we can tell from his notes that he
1384.17,1393.95, identified very much with english eccentricity and said a very positive thing and recognized the amaniel and death he was prompt to
1394.13,1404.87, qualities and that they found it funny i lost the time of condemnatory daring because of his sense of humor in which
1405.02,1407.63, was accountable i think to
1407.75,1412.79, sometimes quite a bracing personality welstoke his mind
1412.91,1415.13, continually and
1416.54,1419.27, confident in his ability
1419.33,1422.75, a topical when he started working ones
1422.9,1424.85, to protect his
1425.0,1427.34, he wasn't able to
1427.58,1431.42, she recognized in the way the those
1431.51,1435.23, coblich is probably the one most eccentric schools
1435.29,1442.13, and strangely enough quite recently that a figure i also photographed priceless
1442.13,1457.13, and this is a school in london at limehouse that they still were yellow socks and a white ties cattle herdsmen place and i imagine that has a profound effect although he bent like it
1457.49,1458.51, said
1458.57,1461.54, to have a big effect on your oldest
1461.78,1468.5, and we need to talk with hallensee have touched one class but we have a talbot
1468.8,1504.74, which is the all through his working in well i love her that the whole class issue of course for i very much but i apothecaries is much too basically here i was domineering can i noticed immediately there is this massive gate between the life is experiencing and the bodegas seeing by my colleagues and part of my job i think was trying correct it and it seemed to me back in the early ages meditation by this o lord that the middle class has been entirely overlooked because most poetical
1504.92,1522.71, fundamentally middle class even the working class ever promoted themselves and it's very easier to salute her for other wealthy people of people ascociate submit or indeed to return to your roots and apology puranapore in the middle despacho missed
1523.04,1539.18, the whole of consumers society you know sir why is it certain subjects are overlooked and part my work in the ages was to try an address distances and that's why i came up with two naoroji photographing consumers and photographing the middle classes
1539.39,1583.34, these were things very much emerging in those times so i felt pentodon the dates of course they got on a grown dominated society further so part of me has a responsibility as a document doctor or at the politic to actually record and show what's going on in the world and one of the things that in the black country is you know dispensations is tascosa the biggest shop an influence intermunicipal aspects of the black entry and he now for easy to go to a chain factory or some old factory talbot the rooms of the black country we've done that but a close going to a huge tastes in dudley is just important as that as well
1584.96,1589.55, i think they can go to the disemboweled
1589.64,1608.66, so the entire was the only in england it evoked the doctrinally had an exhibitor of association artifacts and photographs from the the forties and and i guess i entreated whether passpiration and had any influence on you whether you might talk a little about
1608.75,1615.38, to taking photos at the other end or social polity
1615.8,1627.44, no assumption i didn't really know about it until my twenty five years ago and i remember going to bolton because bolton is i know a long elation of the man
1627.47,1635.57, where the studies were done and think in one point that i would do and no great obstacle er quite so casting up moved and attend
1635.75,1639.98, no i think it's a fantastic sort mean
1639.98,1650.87, fundamental thing about music really tense observation the tredegar played a small but important part of that but it wasn't really the residential was mainly observation and
1650.93,1661.4, that interestingly when i did that i tassaras me to put forward a subject and i chose a funeral and his love of furloughs because if you recall
1662.75,1671.09, spoonful stands peninsula funeral i watching it i thought the aragonese it is one of the great of boissey
1671.21,1673.64, probably not just the interior
1673.85,1681.05, don't prearranged in you expect to silverstein tolerant
1681.05,1686.9, every one brings the cameras who booful don't see any prototypes whatsoever why is there
1686.99,1712.1, though it never get employed view a feelosopher lassies to less important event is just part of the baggage of how i read the tolomei and palomino is the question that and to androtten when i put this down as a subject by her a lot o people objected which i thought was in to see itself despite the factionists key in a domestic funeral
1712.79,1715.55, and i think it a section of the show
1715.55,1717.2, was on the
1717.23,1723.41, your reading of tone recessed of space
1725.99,1728.54, just to talk on the debate on
1728.72,1733.88, you going to the incinerators amazing
1733.97,1743.33, well thousands spirits going to the archives and seeing this you know all too and half tourandocte to it some one of the things i loved
1743.36,1752.57, the defining things i was looking for was some of the portages where i felt the sort of spatial look and feel that raconis working on
1752.6,1780.53, being you know executed the perhaps ignored by him and i think that's probably the one thing that i learned from this and if we see the new set of frigates with greg i think that's one of the defining elements within these pictures is he really going to sense of this the whole scene and he will place things and people and objects within the frame and you read as a whole frame i think
1780.53,1816.62, so the previous generation of toast from simple picture post the tended not to look at photography looked the subject they are places subtilised the frame and they were aware of that whole use of the frame and ability the one thing oleomargarine comic pictures which are first poison which the ones that i saw back in the seventy one and this was exemplified and echo when i had the softened the contact and find more pictures which executed and language sobriety
1817.07,1821.27, overloadin membership
1821.96,1824.54, about for a bottle
1825.23,1832.58, the tilting back attention and he felt that magnificence is look
1832.61,1833.93, i wanted to be
1834.29,1837.77, what he wanted to do in the yoke
1838.34,1842.93, then in sixty nine he applied for magna
1843.92,1855.05, they said well we got donnington with his mimbreno room for another economy question he said when you were opened
1855.14,1859.64, it numbers but madeleine your attitude to
1861.86,1875.39, accepting it taheitan you for the earth ideals not in all this peninsula the details about her and returns to minnow them so precisely was brainier
1875.6,1887.09, and it also to your question no didn't change me whatsoever and i think i will be surprised at any toloache if they became a member of magdalena
1887.24,1892.52, so the facilitate what the potion you know we are determined
1892.58,1902.06, fine people with her own voice and for them within the sort of world of toby to continue to use their envoys at the find a way of oaten
1902.06,1910.64, neefit moses so it hasn't really stopped the whatsoever but unrelated
1910.73,1914.96, applehead occasions and the response 
1915.47,1922.1, both of these generated the ossaise of forty
1922.7,1924.38, the
1924.56,1931.31, on looking at the turn latinists and yours is the power of the gaze
1931.37,1934.7, and you know i'm just wondering how you
1935.03,1938.51, you think about her the people you photograph
1938.81,1941.09, feel about your photographs
1941.45,1943.52, do ask them
1943.7,1947.54, i standing outside
1947.96,1949.37, the
1949.43,1972.8, first off i abridge i mean i had a workshop in the central time all the philosophies so as well as giving individual copies of the people in the photographs like one a chapel are people have a chance to see them likewise with the document under superintendent people and generally
1972.83,1983.09, i don't quite well the other projects like unlike middle classes that's less so whereby i met a beginner in the prologue
1983.21,1988.76, moderation momentum each project has its own way for you could protested
1989.03,1995.33, ever think about it ethically about intrusion and of well i think all the top others to a certain extent
1995.39,1996.47, exploit
1996.47,1999.14, trude alathea
1999.23,2010.06, i don't see that any reason by woman stop now men think and cherish that the fact that we still are in you to fullalove public place and to inhibit and published that
2010.3,2016.33, i like cashmere more quickly so
2016.36,2019.3, the funeral the tale
2020.23,2025.3, this week there's been a bit of an outcry of selfish funerals
2025.57,2033.04, and the lions with you i can't see a problem with that and i wonder what your opinion was because
2033.31,2054.16, i am recently passed away and she wanted to brither life a poet so we didn't have black we had very unconventional sons of her funeral and we took photographs because we had relations at the funeral the reading it every often so we celebrated and his pictures of people wearing comfortress and
2054.16,2061.06, he sees and things and people actually horrified when we put them on face but the soletary is reactions feel
2061.48,2082.93, i think that it tantalising idea to do the self is the notice to day that that word being accepted in together the earth first nicolay has its mother automatism response you got with facsimile to the one i got a commission
2083.14,2097.12, but i didn't show all time his bagonet that what is correct for love or is incorrect for solidement on the one containing control a situation you generalise
2097.57,2109.6, a different thing and some economies body didn't know and taking for i mean i have very often females but of course the only people i know who died on betther funeral but i actually photographed
2109.75,2114.04, other people's treasure not mission from
2114.49,2118.66, organizes and relatives of the dead to to do that
2120.28,2125.65, you you see was longstreet
2126.43,2140.53, i understand why this is such an issue i just gave seemeth of the baggage missionaries
2140.56,2143.02, mexico is
2143.26,2153.85, with the kind of collision coming the politics of austerity of olivares quite an is spoken about and in a number of different ways in nine
2153.91,2161.59, newspapers and of rhetoric i was wondering whether there were any photographers who now
