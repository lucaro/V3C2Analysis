42.75,56.34, before i do let me just say a few words about human rights and what we do and why the work of him hearing an and patachiaou the world is so important as a part of human rights documentation
56.79,62.85, a human rights which we describe what we do and how we do it in three words
63.09,64.68, investigate
64.68,67.59, we expose and we change
67.68,94.38, the first septemvirate we go out to the field we go out to the places to the country to the regions where human rights violations are being committed and we talked of victims and witnesses we gather testimony we look for evidence we take pictures we go to mars we go to hospitals we go to court rooms to find the facts to find out exactly what's happening what happened who is doing one to whom
94.89,123.96, i once we have gathered the facts checked the evidence cross checked the evidence talk to more victims and witnesses looked at more evidence we document our findings and then we come to the next stage we expose we put the facts out into the public domain we reach out to journalists and policy makers and members of the public with the stories and the facts that we have gathered about human rights violations around the world
124.41,144.81, but is not enough just to tell the story as it's not enough just to put the facts out there into the public the man it is not enough as the cethegus to name and shame we also want to see change we are human rights activists we expect that to be changed and entertains
144.84,153.48, bringing a perpetrators to justice and new laws new standards new mechanisms to protect human rights going forward
153.84,192.24, as a worker i evolved over thirty five years we have increasingly understood the power of imagery to go alongside the words which are the heart and soul and have for a long time been the heart and soul a few and rights watches work and tim had harrington was one of the first people to really make us understand the power of images for social change and for human right change we first work with him in the nineteen ninety where he when he was living for eight years in west africa covering the wars in seraine and liberia
192.27,198.78, which were characterized by a paling atrocities and terrible levels of human suffering
199.23,206.16, and in subsequent years we worked with him in dortrecht and smiling her
206.16,231.9, amongst other countries through working with him we understand not only the importance of imagery and powerful profession imagery but we also learn the importance of working with photographers with genuine human insight and genuine concern for the lives and well being of those whom they were documenting
234.51,289.53, in recent years we have developed further relationships with photographers we have used more and more imagery from around the world if you go on our website if you look at any of the reporting that we do from creosote world you see the increasing financial emerges of producing visual imagery through instantial media and that all of you after the film to go to our website and look at the work that's done by marcus please do from the central african republic one of the most egregious and violent human rights crises of a day to see the powerful images that his producing alongside the human rights documentation
289.53,291.36, human rights research as
292.35,309.81, then we just say one other word of finish about journalists and journalism and particularly falters over the nearly thirty five years that human rights which has been working we have always given particular importance to the freedom of the press
309.96,335.16, it's not that we think that gerald should have more human rights and the body else but we recognize that the free press and an active press and the press able to report on wrong doing and corruption and human rights abuses wherever they may occur is a crucial and critical element for a free society it is absolutely necessary for all of us
335.16,344.82, to be able to claim a human rights and to ensure that government and authorities around the world receive the scrutiny that they merit and deserve
345.27,382.68, it is of enormous concern how in so many of the countries in which we cover from tyrants like russia and bellerose to war ones like syria and taylor whether a famous flames now just shut in legionnaires were deliberately targeting generals and meticulous of course because they did not want to see them reporting on police brutality and abuses
383.04,404.46, in syria in recent times over journalists have been detained on disappeared by armed groups are armed gangs for various reasons and during the protest intercalate toying the councilors up more journalists than any other country in the world we saw journalist being harassed and detained and attacked
404.97,424.71, freedom of the press is a critical element of any human rights work and in particular the power of poltergeists to bring images from the ground inspires move us and encourages is a critical area of human rights work and i think all of this will be brought up in this brilliant film that you're about to see
