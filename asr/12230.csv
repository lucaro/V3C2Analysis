4.68,12.12, first time around the floor
12.12,14.73, well was it i wanted to say
15.06,18.12, sky pale blue as a robin's egg
18.21,19.68, this robin 
19.92,22.35, blue and then the sky
22.83,24.87, and what would it matter here
25.2,36.69, back both of another bar happy hours still a distant dream and early afternoons washed out like blistered by the front windows near
37.02,39.24, why was it i came here
39.63,43.62, sol and shadows and the clack of billiard balls
44.25,46.53, now i'm too old for this
47.28,56.61, it's not that we fight exactly but every argument leaves a shut up and terrify like young lovers waiting on a home pregnancy test
57.27,58.89, one or two
59.22,61.11, line for blue
61.53,65.25, the only thing certain that no one will speak
65.58,67.68, matter what there is to say
68.31,70.11, that old poll again
70.65,74.01, nothing much matters nothing much last
74.55,76.23, and the robin
76.47,78.03, a sky
79.92,83.94, i've got enough change for two songs on the juke box
84.09,87.03, time still before i've got to head home
87.78,92.1, i'm thinking pale blue eyes and lonely tear drops
92.46,93.9, slow
93.9,95.58, something fast
97.41,99.3, oh emptiness
99.42,104.79, o take me one last time and your arms won't you
105.45,108.84, at this then and shimmering light
109.38,110.85, more so
111.27,113.1, how to dance
134.49,305.43, i'm so lonesome worrysome time one day one never have from me homesteader heard from you since you went away libation for letter in when the never cameronians the seminole momentariness little
306.24,309.0, so
