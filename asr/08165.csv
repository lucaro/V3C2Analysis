0.0,557.07, neither everybody is soluble from glentroom in this trial were going to cover how to create entrance form of the eland so first infers if you need to blinderpool to wondering what the hell is this thing here what this is a freely cursed in his very useful and later we're going to see some applications for it but for now let's say that this despondent to create new objects to give position it left black in in the space came with chitrasena and you can positively from the graphic verse you can even line it but we are going to see that later for now let's stay in the spaniard this three decision now i see how to create objects the first way is pressing here as in the menu leaping ashore and at a plank the second way is the short had shifted will have the same sack man as her right so is very useful and acute for example and now the third way is present spacertown for sample and now you can search here what to a somebody what you want to add for sample attitude reentered the two now when you create noted or execute some operator you will have her in this to shelf which you can hide or show with the torterin the human dosewell have some properties for that operator or in this case we created an object so we have here the operator name at two and here we have some options like this to the berrisford to bradstreet to kano i'm going to show you another way of creating objects if you create an obey now you see that i linthwaite is another way to alington controlled her line of the two boys now when you have object it will be a line to the bow well this is useful for sample i want to other plan you can add it temperate together the floor or you can add it from a side view for being a work yeoman other beauty like this so she can see his pretty useful okay now live me splain to basic gossips when you walk in a treetop to cantando in any tactics to difference between editing interfarin is that transforms don't change the polity of the shape of the object but atacinus so when you move rotate or skillet you achasmenian when you enter in the editor that's why it's called a monaeses to radiant object because you are modifying the pology and shape and this torelore turns forms and if it is to toil of modelling will see heartened now you know this let's move on to translating rotating and calling often so let's created noted so you can see manipulators this is the translate many player here in the freebooter you can select which many plates you want to use for some this is the retaineth is the calumniators my present this i can here now if you clinometer and that taxes i want for a sample to move the orderin the sea and why assisted the same time what i have to do is to shift like access so it will be moving in the other two axes at the same time now if we clean drag and will drag in irascible a slow down so we can do a more decided movement and if we press control it will be moving with the snapping options this is the perfect time to plan the snapping which is here in the tribute if you activated you don't need to breast contwol be snapping automatically and if you with this undebated one to move it without snapping you have to push conditionally but the most useful at least for matinees it and just prestigious this is the kind of snobbishness i will is not it is not the object to the green gate in whatever is the canneries to artifice or volumes but now we are not going to see that you can let rotates we can drag wieland with his galleys the same we can drag quick and drag and if you press the centre you will scale in all the axes at the same time this happens too with the transform it will muttered relative to the view okay now you can see more than one manipulator at the same time resemble if i want to show the money platoon and moving at the same time just shift pickand we have here the translating rotating object at the same time now for the rotate if you press in the centre you will rotate it in a tragaldabas this is rotating in all the axes you can also atsettrey spaniard man you will have here a salmantino with location rotation and scale values so you can change them here or right them dilettissimo can also from the feverish ruppertshain rotation in scale montessori system or for sample we have disputed retaliations meredithians even to the cubes fatalite manipulator is lined to the world if we take the transliminal you can see that if we moved the aftermath seaxes it will move on the world ceases but if we want to use the local seats of the object we have to go here to this last and let local for example so is this the local axes of the objective several more coordinate system systems and we have liability to create tomassen on objects we can do it from
557.07,927.84, as for orientation here we have the same many things here create so with create we going to adhere and new cardinalist which is mishtress of the cut so if we are here another object that this we're going to use this cardinalist of the other object even this subject is not oriented that way so is pretty cool aletheia frame or right be the shore for access in the coordination is alsace had you have governor a gambol mascotte goal for now lesson at the shores for transforming of this england we have to select the object in going to hide the manipulator and now the shock etcetera in in a few coordinating in as for scaling if you write click it will be cancelled all right now let's say i want to move this obtuse one axis well while robin so pretty and will rain we can press a why or said so the adeline to the axes pressure will reiterate attract matter so we have this for sample and now if we want to move disarticulate can breast for sample twice and we with the otherness the same for why presence and the same for sale the same happens with britain with scale and there is even anathematise to inacessable let's write clicked for selected and present wallabies the middle masbate on the direction like a twill be a line to one aesthesis very cool another thing if i dress well i have to have this at the bettersons if we relied drag it will be moved automatically on a decoration another thing while robinson to move this object on candidat the same time just press shift in sad and the rothesay want to move it and see in at the same time his pessimists is a very cool season i think this is a good moment to show you how to continue your blandishments so if you go here to the same one you can see i'm working a magic so i have everything a matter and the trees and date but you can't change it burial for working the angels and well this is where how you want and none you're working with plenderleath matters right now so let's take a look at this three befeather and when i turned for me an object you will see that here some numbers will appear for some if i move the object with the index began see there the amount of centimeters him moving it right so we out confirming the action just while dragging you can tie down the amount of intimates you want or matter or whatever so if i put her one you can see that it automatically will move my object one matter i can but space empress for some three or despite i want to move it thirstier in the axis khaftan sample in the cases i wanted to rotate ninety degrees and that it so this is very very useful okay now let's see the treaty cancerous so we create another object for some boon i don't know and i fear this let's hide this poleski i want to a line this is fear to disobey we can use the frittata began as it even for a interpretation to aline it to the object so if we press here chief as a popanilla appear this is the man of the hitcher we got some obsolete to select
927.9,991.11, this will put the frigate on the position of the center of the selected object okay if we have more than one object let them it will be put on the middle bright but for now let prettier and now so let this fear shipped here again and selection to curse and then we have it we can not see the savior right now because it's inside the cube so let good discreet on a wife and mode and there we got this fear know we can ah aintcher to the great so as you can see if i put the case here for a sample and i wanted to be just on a point on the greed we can preternatural there we go
991.35,1075.74, so now we cure all in this sordid selection to curse katie wanted with them on the center yes i agree now as to election to coercing began also lintott as the object for example here you have this is fear that his langwige world but the cubist so if i want to lindisfaire this cue we have to do this in the object manured notion here with this alinement the transform orientation is this one here gloveress in this case if we work in a glove or nation the oiselle a line to that relation less taliacotian lineaments to gain a short dition on the on the use of preferences alice pressed and you can see the cuisine now with the transformer invasion so conciliated
1075.86,1105.44, what we want is to alan this is here with this cue so let's press this sphere and with shiftlessly now the cube of the cube is the active if we produce a normal cotoneaster the transformed will be orientated as the antipodes is so if we press now transformed into transform orientation
1105.53,1156.5, it will move his fear so it will be a line with the cup that we have it and that's how it works there is even another use that you can give to this three decatur with is one of the most important so if we for example were let let this of the state there unless change the counterpoising here this last i have some options for the center we are using for transforms it so you have here individual medium point when you have more than one objected and at the element at so for some less while
1156.56,1172.28, if we use the development you see that the transform is at the position of the development ritratti even we have a lot of articles they will rotate
1172.55,1181.13, over the active one now with individual for example they will rotate in dependently
1182.51,1191.48, and this one here is the decanter so now they will rotate around the three carter
1193.16,1209.3, they will be scaled from the predicate so this is very cool for example if i want let's say ah this point here she if this corsetiere
1209.3,1238.1, and now i can retain this cut her untamed which is very cool in some cases a i even can a line the cube to that birds so you can use the treasure as a people point to make transforms in the objects and now there is another thing
1238.1,1241.46, but i like to talk about an estate one
1241.46,1251.27, sphere which is manipulated obtient only if you have more than one look of the selected egypt was here
1251.27,1256.61, and just kill the pit will be moved apart
1256.64,1260.66, from each other but they will not be called
1260.66,1289.43, depend so you are going just to kill the centre of the abject position it is very cool casket said the trees sang and well that's out for this istoria in the nasal talk about modifies in blander to you soon in happy landing
