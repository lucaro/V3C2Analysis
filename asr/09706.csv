0.03,14.43, he
15.03,38.1, we started our collaboration and at a time when communication and photography was really going through a complete transformation we called it the digital revolution and renardet things were changing and the traditional aspect of making images in my eyes was you know
38.34,72.57, change in somewhat i went back to london after having spent six months in cape town in ninety seven making a film and walk in the mountains and a master kept on an incredibly special place and i came up with this concept there the ego was at fault with everything and that i can aberration was the way forward and eighteen years later on the donate must be some yet unfortunately he met me right sir
73.05,156.99, that's the sheerwater 
157.95,164.52, myself extorted in the early nineties probably way before most people go into confuses and
164.79,174.66, the process you know and the interest take two to three days to even move something around a screen or do something with an image and myself enacted to kind of
175.08,202.98, join forces because we could see what was coming in terms of the image making process was going to get bigger was going to get more complex than the mediums were certainly univalve as they are to torpid place to day so by joining forces we can of started a studio which was like a big sort of shed for myself for making it go down every day you know traditionally think about images and think about photography but at the same time we would constantly be thinking about how we could reinvent
203.04,249.75, language how he could use what was available to us to combine craft and the digital and by combining those elements out opposite basuto find their visual emotion within her and to explore you know the parameters of of what contemporain actually stood for at the beginning i don't think we really knew what we were doing but what was important was that we were there every day from eight in the morning to ten twelve at night just looking at stuff and making stuff so that we could kind of forage and create an evolved the language that today is become a very common ground image making very common to day where you know the teams of people and the process is evolved into that
250.65,289.74, sort of great handshake we've always had a very very deep fascination with popular culture and popular culture is fed back into certain aspects whether was fashion the team that come in fashion from her and make up to starling are to music popular culture you know which really is at the core of what we do at drivel of work inspires us to do what we do and you know these subjects and these fascinations and this and this sort of process that we forged and form ultimately became our language
289.74,302.43, these are some of our earlier pieces that we made together and you could see there really are quite experimental in terms of you know actually always began with a photograph and i always began with
302.76,352.5, a preoccupation to how we would like that and what are the big things that we were experimenting with at the time we still do but which sort of got really bored with traditional medium so i kind of packed everything aside to what we we years alternative light sources from later to projection to build in light in the early days you know alledging of the street but eighteen years ago we were commissioning electricians and technicians to build ardour us that we could use as light that we could explore mediums with a record create the yimage unknit now they were you know it might excretory because of their process not only because of the light but because of the teams and because of how we were ultimately image process in the more ending up at fort you know at an end result
353.52,385.5, we quite successful you know very early on in our career we had a lot of great breaks and a lot of people recognize what we were doing very early on and allowed us to you know find a very quick marriage between articles and i think that's really important and it not that we yet to day to talk about their relationship because i shall think what's more important for me necessaries and the collaboration that have come through our process so early on wet done a whole bunch of work and we got this cool
385.62,409.59, paris to go and meet the great of director of isaiah which at the time was still being produced by having pen and we were like well is as a big sort of deal to be one train in paris and it was monumental we did three days of me tis with the japanese they made us stay two nights in paris and
409.68,446.97, completely dissected our portfolio or language as his characters are now who are wives are girlfriends alias a complete three day interrogation and at the end of it they said with love you to start produce or campaigns for us to mister vipan as no more canongate campaigns any more and we'd like you to stop producing a campaigns for for myself personally that was like one of the biggest accelerative ments that i could ever imagine achieving because growing up and starting my careers of it togather of ingpen's an absolute legend and
447.0,450.81, it was someone i knew the work and i knew the campaigns and
450.81,464.31, sort of a dense game where we working with no details i had taken over from his seminary and we were producing campaigns to the minute and it was a really borough thoughtful process
464.58,470.91, but when on first seven season so we could spend our days to talking about it but just move on for it quickly
474.24,482.52, we got asbestos which i'm sure you all aware of cocoa
482.82,492.72, approached us as well she'd seen the work and she was like a love what you guys are doing i'd love you to do something special on it's my fifth birthday and
492.75,510.93, take over the store you know i'll find you could make him ages you can make a book you can do whatever you want so we again embarked on earth exploration and heated a bunch of images and you know celebrated collector birthday
510.99,546.87, the back of that the communications director for carter came contacted us we was teemed with a terrible hangover the day after this the hand of a party that sarah thrown and we got a call of age and said about ten a m in the morning saying that we had to go to a meeting like really organdy with cartier as they needed to talk to you about a project will i can't you just delay this is it we are completely hung orewell worse than we do this morning it was now her 
547.83,553.26, we resent to the meeting with sunglasses on and lots of parasites more and
553.41,565.53, again it was like a dream or given to the war they will at wepener into make something that defined the five fragrances for kate but we didn't want to just repeat
565.56,582.69, communication where its traditional it's sort of leans back to the past we would like to give you as the project you've got or london do whatever you want the only thing we want back from you is magic eats important as well as the supports pre digital
582.69,584.58, you're seeing right now is
584.64,587.7, exactly what we would get on the negative on the emotion
587.7,590.46, in camera it's you know
590.58,604.38, her adoptive days miss around with to spit some bobs and a esitate we don't fit we got to sell it to the mother we don't sell it as in you not that of straight forward but it was quite interesting when they went for the innocent really
604.53,629.67, well think about it now there's something to be said about youth or kind of cause you you don't really think about what you're doing you just do it and the older you get the more you process and analyze what you do the peterwaradin toinette don't ever think i just do it so we just went and did it we made these images represented them and they loved it and you know it's just a testament to kind of i think
629.67,649.08, when myself anecdotage ther and you know we look at image making in a way where i think you know invention and creating a vision emotion to telling stories through the imagery through films a combination of those things are quite important in this danae
649.08,660.21, before in an age when there is so much information you know i think it's probably more important than ever ever before to experiment and explore these things
661.05,696.12, we thought it important to share one of one of our first big films that we got commissioned to do which was timed openhanded indemnities in london came to and said we would like it to write a treatment for a new bead well what's it now bileattack a bit as well we've been asked pri to this about fourteen times by the agencies to sort of doorman a minever got any car campaigns so we never trusted the process so we were out in a levies campaign at the time when we weather really wanted to do it
696.21,738.84, the morning went nay before we shoot so we got them down and then we still ferments the process so because when you when you have to write her you know a treatment for a freccia after if i eyries away basically so we fought well if we don't write and if in down or we don't physical benefit so we videos because we found put it on a davidsbuendler to copy because most people don't want to do amanoolla paranoid at the time like you know how ideas were a magic a search which which i think one should still be you know i think she still have that approach but i think the world changed that settlement a quick minute and
738.87,743.1, think to mention is that we will be introducing
743.85,758.79, orator that we brought with us sir james the bell has come to cape one with us sir james will be coming on towards the end of our speech and his revisers guest at indaba
760.08,783.45, a surprise i think what assailment auspice of aerating things names and above free these are just realized but given a whole presentation or merevale on it then her okay
786.66,846.42, james scored the sound track for us to inanimate and independence initiative teetotallers
848.58,864.12, i do so just as i started i was doing any that james actually took bateato's fifth in and reinterpreted which was quite amazing process for myself for next
864.24,876.21, corwith a live orchestra and then james and his team work on and produce something which was seminat the time from a visual anna and a sound point of view
876.75,901.02, the next collaboration we want to bring up his lithe late annachen we've done many many collaborations with with love the years which is on a share a few for them with them he was one of the rare exceptional creative forces that you know the world is lucky and appropriate and and sort of a 
901.2,907.83, it serials brings a bit of a lump to my throat so fortunately because of the tragedy and sort of
908.16,918.87, in a sad death at l one of had but the chasm of the work that we did with lee over the years which comminated in a tone
919.05,926.46, redirecting and do show famine the year after we did the story with his son
926.76,978.75, and they came down to a studio and was like well you guys are the kings of light you experiment with light and agitatedly glide want to do like she deputy for head and am with this like huge party will like a wood but this was a day before we are going on holiday as well so you completely ruined both for holidays because it's sort of ejus like a crater bongo and often i had and we will like weedon actually know what to do so we spent entire holiday thinking about studio forty four had as and how we could visually bring the life and come up with this idea that asimof opens or prince or segments satisfait whereas lady or for catherine anyway we even made a scale model and we were quite prepared to even risk showing leave the model and then
978.78,988.17, turn down as leading his mind that the hour entered up at the studio after holidays it was like right to change my mind about sudavit four
988.17,1035.78, make bird soused the italian we now absolutely like great and that was it from there on we you know we went into production design we worked with their fantastic gyaros bennet who do a lot of work with no when the great production designers and we came up with this concept of a boreland using virtue which we use in a lot at the time an offertory inaugurating as light sources which to day again is very common practice but at the time at the time no one had been one was reminded doing that so metabasis months to conceive this work out where we were going to put the lights with the bill a fourteen minute film it ran through the whole thing as well because the whole thing turned from a bird into a butterfly into a skull
1035.99,1049.73, for the fourteen minutes sir was canework in through these animations production design get in at a paris trying to do the animations and can of hoping and praying it would all come out at the end which i did
1052.49,1177.41, collaboration we want to share with you is massive attack now think robin and indicates a two years ago reasonin massive attack or one of the you know one of the old time great in terms of music culture in terms of what they produced and in terms of what they stand for with their many collaborations with a gainer the years where we've you know from press to album work too to canoaboa ions will share a film that we made in ponderous six for the ice was interesting about this film was that we at the time were experimenting with scanning which was still very new and basilicae was very slow but we did where we would get the getanittowit the information and make something beautiful and your selecting from the early graphic work to what we ended up creating or but again it was you know as an organic project the guaviare
1177.41,1186.89, so just going to show you a small cliff as it goes on for evidently by sharon some lettuce if anybody's into it they can
1187.04,1189.83, check out or will show them or sell
1192.56,1202.49, approach but times and hudson collaborate with her future is the fashion future is called suzanne who was put a remarkable
1202.85,1209.03, no rights but he decided to kind of become a research fellow and
1209.15,1220.88, at the forefront of many many many technologies that are now only starting to serve a like growing clothes and you know the microtape of where fashion was had in it eternity
1221.06,1226.91, she approached us and she had this book that she was going to publish that she'd been working on for
1226.91,1233.3, how many years ten years i think and development and research and we
1233.48,1246.08, with her made all the images that you see now and they illustrate different subjects within the book depicting the future of fashion just a few images but through the book of an we made fifty pictures yet 
1249.32,1253.31, not one of our most
1253.31,1274.73, operations and continues to day just before we came last week we shot the couvade in london and economise you much from that because it's siltonian this if if we showed it which is let the cat out of the bag but
1274.85,1282.92, we'd like to assure some of these some of the moments of our delirations with bare eweword and love be for
1283.28,1284.48, yes now
1285.23,1299.3, elevation than that aifter yer yer fourteen make a beheld what would be elaborated for eighteen i think since he
1299.63,1304.25, i told mary couple perhaps
1305.63,1317.75, around the corner for each other a studio is just one heroically ever side of a park just but it distance i think
1319.43,1329.66, i think the thing that you know i'm sure you'd find interested about because that she is she is an incredible character and
1329.66,1330.8, you know
1331.1,1358.31, myself a korean privilege and fortunate to have met some one so wonderful and so colorful and so trusting within the creditors because she is always so seasons in terms of you know her energy her commitment her vision and how much she gives in terms of you know her creditors and then how much she allows in terms of freedom to to explore and create
1359.39,1361.85, sometimes interesting forces well because
1362.87,1375.65, the ottawas sort of looking at new things and you every time you think you've done it all you've done you know tolerates block or image makers blocks
1376.1,1379.22, for baritone something which is
1379.46,1381.74, messing with our head a bit and were
1382.76,1390.62, video only going to be a film in some sense but it's equal with shot it in a fortiori the whole
1390.62,1396.53, is going to be in full virtual reality and was quite dubious to be honest 
1396.68,1404.27, the whole of thing you know and i don't think there i don't think till you actually
1404.27,1408.29, into the fully amusive value
1408.68,1412.88, see or you get a feeling of how how incredibly actually
1412.97,1415.49, maybe how dangerous is as well
1415.52,1420.41, lottie for how it perceived because it's quite addictive
1420.44,1423.29, levels it's this is something
1423.29,1434.96, to show you what we here in disarming action to the three danvers with i think it's unimportant because the process of voles much and were really were almost i think
1435.2,1448.16, now at the second are nice song sweet wort of you know the midnight as was the complete digital revolution and now i think we were sort of go in through another revolution right now as we can't have fully embraced the third dimension
1448.28,1453.83, and this is a clipston really give anything away but it shows the kinetic capture and
1453.89,1502.37, the aspects of the assets that we need for part of the process of making or the different elements that we're going to combine wentstile we also used photogram try as well which is a against later salaciousness operational it is let's farleyense but i think it was just important to share with you guys because you can see the process and and see a little bit of what we talking about
1503.3,1505.97, is
1508.16,1522.23, a collaboration that presently commissioned by the british arts council and the resident choregraphy for the saddles weltereoden was rosselmann heppach us to

1540.29,1585.11, explored a subject matter that was appropriate to kind of vision but equally went on a journey again with james tell doing the music and which is a very very special song tracks which show a small piece from the film but you should go and check it out if you want to see them you know the entire piece goods it's a very special school and it's a great film it ended up we ended up showing the film in freeze london two years ago and we are too over london casagrande had an installation called agathon the outside and then we had the film and a bunch of art work that you've just seen show if you slip from it

2336.97,2346.21, what were a feeling that the moment for we worked on i mean we started working together a long time a gardener and for nearly twenty years and
2346.6,2373.84, originally started working with orlean the early days in my wax and then throughout the project that i do and from the second album we saw dinahgurrerhlowah
2373.93,2380.65, go off to a things come back together and we start chansonettes down with talk about warren
2380.65,2385.72, we're doing i come from a sort of culture of college initially being at
2385.72,2391.87, a red label and from that we sort of bill you know you got a culture of working with musicians artists
2391.96,2401.86, coming from hippias very much about the whole identity the language the visual identic cateran and so will you know we taking that
2401.89,2421.75, it working into operates we sit down we talk about what were inspired by and for instance with something like this i've just started working on my new records so we're talking about that crinoline a new identity the fact that on this record is its massive always partner with people in the past this is a record making
2421.87,2433.24, of my own in that way and so on in to try and kind of find a new identity for what what i was doing and this record but against the work in progress so that the imagery that we
2433.42,2472.33, giving on friday some and this imagery you'll saying with some the last record and a lot of you know records to me like diaries so it's about how you feel in time and the last record was very much coming out of an era where i'd worked with future two thousand coming from stray i'd wait three from mathematician who come out street or street or the whole kind of more coming from the hooping i wanted to create something which wasn't so much the boys were to something where it directors directors were more live there was a more ocellata going on max with electronic and so the image just saw which in a kind of a reaction to a
2472.54,2482.02, one had done in the past and it sort of always right that you kind of react to you know where you are going where you see yourself you know so this then the record where we've created new work
2482.14,2487.33, sort of about you know where one's going in again it's a sort of diary of
2487.33,2495.94, feeling experience emotion you know we done quite a few they're got to music for this with gems so that socialism the runaway
2495.94,2535.39, he hesitates presentiment
2536.14,2562.54, mediatizing kind of it came out what shooted for for a single thread and it was part of the same sheet was one of those amazing moments where we shot something it didn't quite fit for what we were doing in the the main body a work and suddenly had an we had a new piece of work and that's what it's always great when you work with people at werner you start with something you have an idea and then how that grows and where that goes is always
2562.63,2565.72, amazing you tend to come out with quite a lot of different
2565.93,2578.62, things of that process and i think that's important about the relationship to me is it that you know music is to me is always essential about identity and i think we need see the one in the they worked with some of the
2578.74,2613.63, as in that way when you talk about bands like mathematical or we all came from a culture in the nineties were you know video for jography and and music coming together but in a kind of lunatic wanting the silent way we kind of got to take or inferias we were generation growing up and stalwart heroines things and it was we are kind of given the freedom to be creative and anna you know it was that master of what we strive for now is to be able to constantly search and create
2613.63,2618.19, unique individual identity to be create your own universe is what
2618.22,2630.4, spies may inspire us and i think it's very important in where we live now where especially in the music business everything is thrown at you it's very cheap image of specially video video is really
2630.49,2642.76, do you know the way that people the attention to detail in video and things that made so you know it's we do this in a very personal but i way but it's very much about ransom thing which is
