29.01,34.98, the mathematics behind population modeling are they complicated
35.1,69.21, not so much populations grow a global level anyway by a simple number of births minus number of days and so it's simply a matter of that interaction between mortality and fertility of course at a national level or original libel migration is a very significant fact in many places like australia as well but it really is important hallucination
69.78,78.66, you birthrights that's one factor that we have managed to manipulate what's been happening with birth rates and what effect does it had
78.96,103.8, i'd like to take a very optimistic view like that ramsay is not not departing in numbers it looks very big but we surrender the tool has done extremely well humanity is then extremely well now we have one for dilettanti six and the moment to hepatitis come down from around six and seven so the success is there
103.89,104.91, and
105.18,114.3, but of course played the vital role in pulling down the population a twist anagrams probably will stabilize
114.36,119.22, by millions but i think the world bank says will be along
119.22,130.71, by the thousand seventy five and deepened that in fact about after to talland seventy five warning a shrinking population
130.86,155.64, everything goes on right so it is quite optimistic that way so what actually happened with birthrights specifically or are like coming down world wide or at thy coming down in pocket some countries have higher decreasing birth rates and outlines come down a widening developing countries if you see in a dog dainopoulos fifty years the highest
156.18,171.42, on my last years by person which is most of the developing countries are doing officers there is an issue it worries me that african fertility is still sheathed
171.48,230.67, i think it's interesting that the united in has actually changed its predictions from thinking that the world's population would stabilize at nine billion in the middle of the century to about billion towards the end of the century and i think part of that has been that the fertility isn't coming down as quickly as we thought it would in africa and in a few pockets around around tomahawking women's education in proving reproductive health services family planning programs that whole range of things which clover and which really attack the role and position of women in society and i suspect
230.67,233.01, a gale community
233.07,267.21, thought i the fertility thing is one we've got the achieved all we made to achieve will turn to look at other things and i think you know i worry that perhaps there isn't the expenditure and effort and passion going into bringing down for a time in africa as they was in a yestereven dispeople a living longer and that has had an effect on population containeth
267.66,273.3, i guess me wonderfully invented antithetical
273.39,276.9, but developed and developing countries where
277.02,280.35, finding a way to get rid of
280.56,313.41, what of the ills that you kill her earlier and of course that allandale countries were putting in a hole lot of ills that making the way said i it's this challenge between biting and dying if you like and with extended it might change and technological changes and so that means my demographic colleagues will said lidbetter than made that we have the run of the saleswomen eyes
313.62,315.54, the political space
315.54,337.53, a sign that this is the thing that's going to undo a super cost of looking after and aged semi majority and those baby murmurs at the osgood baby bears again and yet as gramont out this is 
337.59,343.11, this is part of a supreme technological advantage that were
343.23,346.62, bringing one down but
346.62,353.61, the gorgon to get out of the white gate that's the thing so you know this is the
353.79,368.7, the race between two ends if you like when you actually look at the modeling united it took us by some estimates two hundred and fifty thousand years to make the first billion people it took us twelve to make the last billion
369.87,395.28, that i personally find that a little startling at will the th century more was the demographic century because we had billionaire
395.31,396.96, huge number of people
397.05,404.91, before that we had a less than two million in the whole of our history attention beginning of that century and
404.91,407.55, it really is an enormous
408.99,412.23, statistic and terms of in terms of our history
