55.2,61.83, because you're human as you watch this you know that some day you will be called home you will die
62.49,65.16, are you really living in the meantime
65.79,86.1, i want t on directing me on the panel today or science advisor the host of syria in the host on sky watch by best friend my wife serenaded the scene to make us all look better than we truly are you artists worn by very thank you and our guest who has written a book that
86.4,116.34, the topic of our conversation for the next couple of weeks she's executive producer of freedom today television national director of regions for christian women in media and the author of a bran new book just out from charisma publishing no regrets how loving deeply and living passionately can impact your legacy for ever here's the book it is our honour to welcome for the first time i scauroit you all thank you the title no regrets boy those are words that i think all of us wish
116.43,167.34, we could say explain the title of your book sir dear when my father was on his death bed he looked me in the eye and he said robin i have no regrets and i thought for a minute how can a man at eighty four years old possibly say with certainty that he has lived a life of never gets and i really started to ponder that in my heart i thought at forty some something i had plenty of regrets and i thought how can you reach the end of your life and have such a statement and it really started some introspection in minehead it took me on a journey to look at my father's life and the legacy he left for me and what he did throughout his life that got him to that point
167.4,255.66, where he could actually say i have no regret that you're a precious caesalpinus patterns they have challenges in their lives especially with their feet that duly to regrets and for him to be able to say that that's powerful it is very powerful my father planted five churches he was in a gospel group the freedom air traveled the country he was bashfulness home you have your own challenge and i certainly had plenty of mind challenges so it really drove me to take a look at his life and get an understanding because i want to be able to say the same thing and i want to be able to forward the achaemenian 
255.78,258.6, he shared a very similar sentiment
259.08,263.7, but about years before that when he was about the aim now he had a heart attack
263.7,268.68, and survived it changed his eating habits and exercise regiment but it is
269.64,275.43, the way he interacted with me changed before his heart attack i never heard him say to me
275.61,288.24, i love you and are still a challenge for him to do it he would always kind of you know you know give me a baragouin him that was a big deal and he said to me toward the end of his life i'd realized after that that
288.84,289.86, keeping that
290.25,295.74, emotion inside was really stupid your book deals with
296.19,299.01, living passionately loving deeply
299.31,381.42, did my dad have some kind of revelation there and how does it relate to the what you discovered as you began researching and writing your book well what really drove the love chapter for me i started to look at the lots of christians that population live their life and if we could all embrace that one section of scripture and loves would be radically different when we would put others first we would not be jealous we would not be boastful would not be envious we would be patient and kind and loving and if you think though that if you just think through that one section what it can do to change your life it can radically change your life we don't do enough interest action unfortunately we go through our day and we keep the same habits we look at things the same way and this book evergreens or lovelier love do we love like christ
381.57,442.71, love do we love like a postle paul to us to love or do we act like the world do we suffer with jealousy and envy and boast bountiful and so i put in this book in the back of the book there's a challenge weatherstone had told me they were going hedeselskabet
442.8,471.3, and i picked up the telephone and i contacted that person and i i will you forgive me i've been angry for two days and that was a real challenge it was a real challenge rightfully you know i had a right to be frustrated at the situation i did not have the right to carry anger in my heart directed towards that person and so even the love challenge for me after writing it
471.33,676.68, it sparked in me a desire to walk godly and do what i know to do i'm not to carry anger at some one i'm to release them and to forgive them and so it even even after writing the book i was challenged to take that love chapter and think through okay what are you going to do now are you going to live what you say you believe and it's a beautiful challenge it will make you think differently you know as members of the body of christ were all used to take in communion and that is a symbol of our unity in our love for one another and paul admonishes us to be for you go down there and accept it or to sit in a pew and accept the wine before you participate if you have anything against a brother sister you make it right or don't do it absolutely right because our forgiveness of others affects us not the other person may not even be aware that were made him her head unsocial media i mean can we do it hainsfeather on social media look stop it just stop it instead of if you got something go to that person privately don't er it on that person's wall for good nigel and the forgiveness part is so vital for her own health and well being and the problem is we bury things we think we're dealing with it we think we forgiven and deep inside were carrying aught against another individual and that's very damaging in no regrets i do dress a chapter on forgiveness because it's such a vital part of our christian experience we have constantly cheshireman their hearts clearings hidden issues that are deep seated in their hearts against a parent against a sister or brother and often times because we are christian we think we can't hold that so we bury it instead of deal with it oh denial denial of very serious because god knows what's in our heart and the bubbles our hearts are deceitful wicked so with this book i wrote the book in such a way that it castramentation premises behind the book to me is what
677.25,679.14, you are dealing with
679.14,700.86, a couple of years back a few years back that put you in this mind set where you felt like you had to make every day count it wasn't just that you got up one day and said you know the world needs another you know positive thoughts or ten step to joy book about loving and forgiving and so forth you were brought face to face with the nightmare that most people
701.46,710.19, in some degree of concern about that moment where the doctor walks in and says boo you have cumber of days to live
710.79,746.55, i would love for you to share that part of the testimony because that to me is one of the most important things that drives the reason you wrote this book was this expectation according to the doctors and physicians that you only had a very narrow time to live it was it was shocking i have been perfectly healthy all of my life never had any issue my daughter was graduated with cancelation my
746.61,804.75, i have painted a friend's home just volunteered to help her paint a room in her house and my arm was bothering me after a paint that room and i thought that i had pulled a mass something simple my sister and my niece came to my home for the graduation party and they said you need to get to a doctor to day we were leaving to go on family vacation to italy the next morning misther is no way i have a houseful accompany where leaving i have to pack my sister and my niece made me go to walk in clinical in and i explained to the nurse what was going on and within just a few minutes she said just set here the doctor will be right in and the doctor came in asked a few questions and said i am very sorry robinette you this but it's neurological and i didn't even know what that meant i
805.02,818.34, her armoury and he said as soon as you get back from your vacation you need to go to have a full medical work 
818.4,844.5, and so i went home and he gave me four diagnosis as that it could potentially be and went home in a research all of those to i went to italy and what happened when i was on vacation i would travel with my family during the day and see the sights and had a wonderful tom but at night i would go into the room
845.82,848.46, and he piped in the pub
848.67,851.34, and a cry of god
851.85,853.35, not 
853.35,857.28, and you told her family any of this yet my husband knew
857.7,864.54, and so i got back from italy and went to the church first
864.69,884.13, and joe i said am not going to a doctor until i am anointed and prayed over so i was anointed i was prayed over i couldn't get into a doctor for fat months and so i picked up the phone and i called maclennan
884.28,920.7, i gave them my symptoms the nurse said a doctor will be right on the telephone they had the chief surgeon of the hospital got on the telephone and said we want you to come right away without a recommendation without a doctor without anything which i thought this must be released serious so i got there and they ran off a test and they took all the diagnosis is off but one the one they left on was a diagnosis that would require no treatment
920.82,922.86, as no treatment of arable
923.04,943.44, and there was nothing that they could do they told me go home and wait and at best if we're right you have two years to live so i thought not that or she's getting married i want to walk the only home i haven't had my first grand said my man started reeling with all the
943.5,993.99, what i have not been able to accomplish so i thought about the work that the lord had given me right that i hadn't yet completed i thought i can't leave until i get this work done that that you give me to do you know how a man's work as he got donaldsonville lienitsin showed to day i still have the filming had to be put in hold everything speaking engagements everything and abetted
994.02,1005.0, live in god i believe in his power to heal to believe in his promises and i knew that that god was with me
1005.18,1033.05, that being said it was the darkest day of my life it was a very dark time but through that darkness god gives us a message to share when we come back into the light and that's what this book is it's the message that god gave me through that dark day now the diagnosis that the doctor gave you as a lass that is incurable it is the about a two year

1586.22,1622.73, i had not turned at that is so powerful and the lord does speak to us and in triolets along the right path he has miracles for you he has miracles for your life i i discourage you get this book get a for your husband for father's day this is something you will want to in your lady's crops and your men's groups you want to study through these passages and challenge yourself to do what to to do a robinetta at least thirty days and really examine your life in your walk with the lord because you never know when this day will be your last throats
