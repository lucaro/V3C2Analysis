0.12,11.82, one of the best features of this camera is the eve control exposure value control this is plus one
12.78,15.36, this would be considered normal
15.42,20.07, and again the is something that you can control
20.61,23.28, even though every thing that's tibbetti
24.09,27.3, this would be consider my miss one
27.69,29.73, to our total control
37.26,45.48, of course why have a three dimensional camera three d camera without close up close up a drama
45.72,46.83, the scene
47.07,49.62, with this particular camera
49.65,52.56, got to be very careful not to get to close
52.74,56.7, my suggestion is no closer than five feet away
64.02,65.28, of course
65.28,75.03, the cameras all about death notices why in gasht and notice on your left the foliage on your left it adds depth
75.75,80.73, problem then is with telephone shots they tend to be flattered
81.57,86.16, and of course the three d effect is not as dramatic
92.4,115.38, rahere's another example where a wide angle shot with the foliage on the right hand side of the scene it has depth to the scene and the three d effect is very apparent but here when you go to the telephoto
115.44,119.4, the effect is not as shall we say effective
126.93,138.81, of course nothing beats experimentation once you have your camera you will experiment with your camera to find out what angles are best for shooting in three days
139.35,142.02, some angels are better than others
142.23,162.63, and you also find because it does not have an image stabilizer you almost always want use a tripod if you don't want to have shaken he also discover i think that putting something for ground as this plant on the right hand side had more depth to your scene
162.72,164.22, something else too
168.39,177.54, when you narrate your fire you will want to make sure that there are no sounds like television in the background because its irritating
177.96,179.94, and not good
180.93,193.68, and in time you'll also develop your own favourite subject matter i like dramatic scenes and three d like this very strong tree and otherwise
193.92,195.12, are
198.33,205.83, earlier i mentioned that you will have verdict on the focusing
206.43,211.38, this particular camera it is after all a plant shoots three camera
211.41,218.91, perhaps these expensive of all the point and shoot three cameras but that does not mean that you cannot be creative
219.15,222.24, you do have creative control as you do with the
222.93,229.53, exposure value you control the exposure and you can be very red dramatic
230.07,232.53, sing that one feature
234.51,242.61, how we use the camera of course a matter personal choice some people would use his camera as a creative art form
242.79,245.82, some people will use his camera therapy
246.18,247.29, after all
247.47,258.48, to me photographs best therapy one of the best therapies you never find of course some people will use it as a diversion to take their minds off their daily grind
258.81,260.4, problems
260.91,268.98, and the grave camera and in the camera defind solace they will create what they think
269.49,271.2, beautiful scenes
271.5,273.87, though the camera has limited
274.17,278.97, can still use the camera to do creative scenes for example here
279.3,283.23, selective focus your fore ground is distorted
283.83,284.52, he
284.55,289.5, no matter what to use his camera for i think it's a fun camera
289.56,293.76, features but a fun camera none the less
295.14,307.32, send me your suggestions and of course your questions in the comment section of this fire and i answer them in the common section so everyone will have the benefit of your observations
307.53,308.7, very much
