23.46,30.63, strange hair when you pull on it can break but if you parted into three pieces and braided
30.69,32.49, try to pull that apart
32.58,40.95, can't there are key places on this earth that are very important to native people
41.82,51.18, we as native americans we have a responsibility to make sure that it's there for our future for our children and grandchildren
52.62,69.3, we move forward and we began to speak for the land and the elements that grow from the line now we're speaking for things that can't speak for themselves the strength is in the radio the people

104.28,116.13, the bears here region is a place i made a wide valleys large plates and deep canyons but it's also an important cultural landscape
116.91,129.96, so we have places up there better maybe archeological sites were shrines and trails in traps of petrolus but also we have this history about these places that we were there we were living there
130.2,132.24, it makes up
132.72,133.65, we are
134.79,137.52, look at some things and i see
137.85,140.58, that's why i am the way i am
141.66,146.1, because of these things that my ancestors left on the walls
146.67,151.38, they left places near springs along the rivers
151.5,153.36, we left for
153.63,161.43, and future generations what you see out there are logically or footprints
161.46,170.19, evidence that we see out there to portraits burials of everything that was a part of their community
170.46,172.98, the footprints of our ancestral people
173.64,174.9, he is
174.93,178.23, he runs as being quite abandoned
178.26,181.59, because the spiritual people still reside 
181.68,185.67, still in our memory is still in our ceremonies
185.79,191.85, i don't see the ruins being just cultural resources they were a part of our lives
191.91,197.7, mothers were there kid were there everything was very vibrant
198.09,201.03, perhaps harsh but people live
201.39,207.42, our people have gone through a lot and there's a lot healing that still has to happen
207.57,212.94, place really touches us and held us and rejuvenates who we are in our spirit
218.22,225.63, see this this plant is a sage
225.72,227.76, good for old
232.92,238.29, this place where i have known all my life called bar ear
238.65,243.6, and in identical super
246.81,253.56, this is where that led his dress come up island

307.83,311.34, if this is something we loved and we lose it forever
311.64,314.4, tribal groups are very concerned about
314.73,320.61, the potential for disturbance of important parts of our history
322.05,334.11, places are still very much part of our home owners and when we hear about patronising damage or our illogical sites being damaged it is in a sense like taking a chapter out of a book
334.2,337.32, so when parts of those are disturbed or missing
337.35,340.08, we're not able to connect the dots as effectively
340.11,341.7, we allowed to
342.51,351.57, don't want to disturb the final resting places of our ancestors and to think that objects that may have been buried with him could be brought up
351.72,353.49, we would never do that
353.82,356.97, a family plot or a grave yard anywhere else
357.93,370.62, i believe is to happen is to calvary strong interpretive program infused into the public enemies to what we will be telling people about
370.89,373.35, and to be respectful
373.53,376.02, be careful where you go

453.27,458.34, reproof cause for a world class cutting edge institute
458.4,467.52, matches indigenous knowledge with western edge western sciences i don't know of any other place where you can find the right now
467.7,480.72, and i think that's one of the most compelling and exciting parts of our proposal this is not just about national monuments this is not just about intergovernmental relations we are about healing
480.72,484.5, the bearers into trabacolo
485.82,486.9, pete
486.9,490.71, a map a region from the new

554.67,558.69, there are still many beautiful stories to be told
559.02,567.57, such an important part of the history the blood that was in the veins of the people that lived there thousands of years ago
568.02,570.12, loyal
570.84,629.37, whole areas are home we still come here we have a relationship with the land it's not this memory it's not something of the past it is now this needs to be a place that the president designates as a monument i don't know if there's any other place where so many tribes are deeply connected to in one dense area or would like to president brothah has inspired a lot of cold in this country and i believe that hope consists of the right to camerieri to an equity in voice i believe that this bears ears proposal that now said sam his desk it embodies them he is in the position to breathe life further into his vision for this country
630.3,633.42, i hope that you will meet us with that vision
