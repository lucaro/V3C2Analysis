273.21,294.27, in studio with me the president so of sky watched t v and a gentleman featured in the film tom horn good beer and the writer and director and the host featured in true legends on holy seat timothy operates could see again excited to be back thinks this is a film that thomas described as the best documentary he has ever seen
294.54,298.98, and i've got to say not all the way through it yet but the production quality is
298.98,305.31, excellent production quality is just you know the rapping the contents of this film are
305.61,315.66, really surprising you guys really brought some stuff that the table well i took a long time to put to film together and it was a massive effort upgrade our equipment
315.69,349.5, and we go to the different locations in this film so you know obviously we had a huge budget to go and do all of this and put it all together because we wanted it to be t quality in a waterproof to go on the discovery channel hitherward thatched
349.5,356.28, because the vatican has the most penetrating intelligence agency on the planet
356.64,379.53, and it's called the entity it's elias the entity this is what the other intelligence agencies call the vaticans intelligence as the sea and say or persons the entity and the reason why they call the entities because it is so enormous and not only is it enormous its old the vaticans intelligence apparatus goes back to hundreds of years certainly definitely back to the jesuits
379.65,397.26, so you're talking multiple hundreds of years and they've been collecting information not only a nation states but also on a cane things on relics from the past the bones of giants they're very heavily involved in the meat
397.35,416.61, everything to do with the mysteries of the ancient world and not only are they involved in exploring these things and gathering the knowledge but they are also involved in covering things up and covering things on covering things over you mentioned in the film in the main locations you visit bolivia peru that
416.64,439.77, there especially but all of the world vaticans had a practice of building churches on top of pagan sits why did they do that well let me say first that it was not our intention to go and try and figure out of the vatican is sitting on top of these ancient sites that wasn't really even on the radar for us we were going out we were looking for evidence of the nisaeans
439.8,571.05, that everywhere we went we found the presence of the holy see and not only the presence of the holy see in these locations but in many cases churches and chapels and monasteries and convents literally sitting on top of the ruins that belong to the world before the flood of noah and have been for many centuries and sweeten the hands of rome so to speak let me jump in he said to glastonbury that i have ever seen in my life i mean baronissima the way the script was written the way the story land cantando bills on one point over the other every time you think you've got to the core of this all of a sudden gets retchistar gets even bigger and then the editing i mean everything about this thing is absolutely highest level hollywood quality which was astonishing to me because i've seen a lot of even good christian documentary productions but this to me this sets the brand new bar appreciation a moment ago the jesuits as one day ask you a question about this because i got to be in one little part of the film later on in the film but significant you guys you and steve and your team you went to rome but you actually even wound up getting into the estates in your when i saw that unlike ochtertyre story because we were when we were in was long after the attack in paris it was i think just a week later whether of the jesuit order and the jesuits called the vatican went 
571.41,609.54, this was an unprecedented thing the vatican doesn't go dark and what i mean by that is that literally went dark usually at night time the vatican is lit up the whole of that city and everything's actually looks very beautiful the way that they like the whole place up and on that night they went dark they turned all the lights off at the vatican and there were police everywhere and there were military personnel everywhere because they were expecting ometepec the vatican the basilica of saint peter which is very interesting when thinking about your latest book the finale
609.75,633.63, this was one of the nights when we were walking around the vatican and the only reason why we were able to penetrate into a certain areas of the vatican was because we were with a friend of mine loughrea cher on the vatican and laws involved in the union with the police in rome and the catholic police and so forth the police and he knew
633.84,644.73, guard inside of the jesuit headquarters so he took us over the jesuit headquarters which by the way is situated not far from actually within a half of a block from where
644.73,664.83, searchers including leo believe that the pi center of a call activity at the vatican resides right here in this very strange church is located down the road from the jessuron the headquarters of the jesuits so we walked down the road after shooting at that church he walked on the road and and leavened to recognize the guard on duty and he said
665.04,719.61, come in you know you can come in for five minutes and so we came in and we literally film that segment inside of the jesuit savages was headquarters and here we are standing there and we're talk about monogram and we're talking about what the jesuits are doing up on mount graham and so i thought it was it's just amazing how the work that you guys are doing in the work that we're doing is just talleyrand's
719.67,746.79, come in to these other billett's the church with it and he says here's the sky's a friend of the jesuits that they bring him right into the gestures and those guys are sitting there and just call way they're saying that's where the top satanic rituals are held inside this church on like a covey import of what malicious in mean it's no secret that there are 
747.0,829.98, you know that there are three stateness at the vatican this is to the traditional catholic within the holy steeple it's a growing problem and now we've seen to take over of the vatican by the jesuit order and which is very interesting and i conservative catholics would agree and there are some out there were actually openly called that's right prisonniere seeing the dissolvent of the traditional catholic church and that's what we call our filthiness and isabeau the confiding things have been for centuries and nobody would dispute the fact that they've concatenation documents and artifacts concerning the flood world and as tom points out in the film and in his books there even now preparing the theology that's going to correspondence
830.01,831.81, so this is
831.9,849.72, that sort of like the exclamation point on the content in our film we'll talk about that event and what the vatican thinks it knows and what they hope to tell the rest of us after we tell you how you can get your copy of the legends the unholy sea staring timothy alberto
849.99,850.89, next
851.64,937.56, those who control the past control the future and no organization on earth has a tighter grip on the official history than the roman catholic church sky watched t v is proud to offer the documentary film true legends the unholy sea venturing producer steve coil and host director timothy albino watches that connected nonsapient evidence of a long plot that cover up the history of the pre flood world and to prepare humanity for the arrival of our space brothers bringing a different gospel order the unholy sea and sky watched t v will include a copy of the best selling book ecbatana true legends the unholy sea and ecbatana both for just thirty four ninety five order now that calling to free a four four seven five o four nine eight five four loganstone take advantage of the exclusive content that we make available online web exclusive from sky watch t dailies updates look at the very nature of reality into the multivertebrate collecting
937.56,1006.26, flood artifacts preformation and keeping it to themselves keeping it from the rest of us how are they going to take this information and spin it out to us or they just going to keep it concealed so that we don't have any frame of reference will with they think is coming it's my opinion that much some of the artifacts that they have and the knowledge that they have obviously everybody aestheticians in the archives that nobody has ever seen except for a very select few who have access to the archives notification be able to read the manuscript to canterstein the archives which i've been told are off limits to everybody however what the vandalia couple of hundred years ago possibly couple thousand
1006.44,1025.31, we know that these are facts exist and we know that the vatican has had their hands on them and so we can only assume that they've been de up in the vault beneath the vatican what sort of artifacts well in our episode one of our series we talked extensively about the idea that that the chronicles of peru
1025.31,1046.76, who were priests of the holy sea documented that they discovered and recovered the bones of giants and were talking about giants feet plus and we know because a chronicler tell us that some of those bones ended up in the office of the inquisition
1046.97,1062.33, the capital ferrand the bones were kept there for what reason were they kept there they were there collected and many people saw them and commented on them and so we can only assume that they made their way ultimately to the great archives involved in collections at the vatican
1062.48,1089.33, along with many other artifacts remember that the whole sea that the church of rome the roman catholic church is in a sense the continuation of the roman empire so and the title pontification to the saturation the prestige and to a degree the power of the roman empire was converted to the catholic church also the artifacts
1089.39,1105.71, the roman empire had gathered from the different regions of the earth as they went and conquered were also then it now in possession of the popes of rome and of the holy see and so that's why the vaticans intelligence agencies called the entity
1105.74,1107.84, nobody knows more
1108.02,1165.02, about the past than the ones who wrote literally wrote history who wrote history for us with the modern world it was the vatican and was the roman catholic church one of the other parts of the film that just really stood up to me is this and solemnising in alike a famous archeologist and gave him elementariness when i was in i went to what's called the conceptions important temple of the inca it was it was the central of their religious activity in the religious life and its located in costaguana opulent the walls of the contemporaneous everything was made out a peer gold and silver so
1165.23,1194.39, this was a place of immense wealth and but it also happens to be a location where the ink of built a temple on top of a pre existing temple a prelude and in the income that by the way they called cocote city of the gods because when they arrived they found the megales so and some prometheus
1194.48,1225.83, the dominican order to the church of rome and the dominican or built their convent right on top of the ruins but the inkhorn and the preludes and took over that whole situation there but before the city fell the inca took all of the gold and the most precious relics and artifacts and and hid them down in a secret underground world called the chionanthus of and this is the since
1226.07,1304.01, underground highway is the way that i would describe an antidiluvian highway that connects both natural and artificial caverns and cities under the ground woman and by the way we find that this is universal all over the earth there is an underground world completely hidden from the public and it is both ancient and also of course the modern a deep underground military basis that we're building today and there connected juiciest of gamaheh entrance to the area inhabited by the gods was guarded by coppersmiths and wrechedness and so he goes to the church and he wanted to meet with the prior of the dominican order that had priests and he met with him and he asked him
1304.4,1307.01, do you know about this legend of the china
1307.07,1315.65, geologists say it's just a legend it's a wife still doesn't exist so he asked the prime what do you know about it and the prior told him it's absolutely true
1315.92,1321.68, and if you want if you'll come with me now i'll show you and this is unprecedented
1321.89,1352.94, officially it doesn't exist right so this prior proceeds to take him into the chapel and they move after out of the way that's covering up a hidden trap door they entered and the going down into a hathelsborough
1352.97,1402.77, and he took some bricks down and they look back in there and he saw the shine conan when i say saw that she cannot segments of the chinchona are built are constructed with megalithic box and the end the hallways are built like they're built like the letter a and in with megaphones of miles in some kind he saw that particular segment that runs from the cochetopa little bit of his stories in the filth film too said the priest 
1403.25,1499.67, i done hoops i was supposed to be one of my doing no no no no seal an you're not supposed to see that you're not supposed to be here you've already seen too much you need to get out of here the priest change like that and so he drove him out of the church and it was years later some seven years later that answer was able to return it was extraordinary that he got permission and we talk about in our film and long story short they did a scientific review with a penetrating addicote priests of the dominican order had blocked the entrance of the scantiest filled in and but eventually they were able to confirm scientifically confirmed that the she canoeists at his present under the church of santa domingo in cusco and that is that proves or point to the vatican is the sitting at one of the things that really stood up to me too was the was a lot of larevelliere cutting away to different secular new sources of were reporting when he first came the wastebasket
1499.82,1509.78, appeal to the congress in peru he was meeting with the president and everything so and they swept it under the rug the smirched his name and his company and
1510.14,1645.77, i know it she goarly exists but the bottom line was you verified same thing we found when we went to mount graham and found out why the pathan then were opposed to all that any where there is the location of what is considered to be a doorway a portal something metaphysical right and any remains of an antediluvian world anywhere you you find that on earth you'll find the presence of the vatican there dominating and controlling the space and who can know what and what they can see but you guys you guys did that man did an incredible job and kicking down some of those doors and talking to the right people i was very presentable them about what are you squinting up next in the treason romanticists does not canelos these were the boys of giants with necklaces and bracelets and last time i check dinosaurs don't wear jewelry well and also and this next documentary you're going after the bonds the proof we are we're doing a lot of things is next in this next step to how much can you let out in the places where you're working without too much attention to it aforetime face book page while we discuss a lot of these events and the post news stories at tom is very good about the keeping us up date on the things in the new targeting as much attention from the main stream mediators meteorites to morals a fascinating conversation the time goes by way to quickly we thank you for watching as we keep watch
1646.16,1649.1, but and this is by watched the
