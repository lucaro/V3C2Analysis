21.12,58.74, for most of us this is an american history looks like but the real history of america is down here in the dirt and over the next half hour the archeological history that we uncover is going to be the history of all of us centuries before the arrival of the first europeans as many as thirty five thousand people lived in the largest city in prehistoric america but by fourteen hundred that city was abandoned and entire civilization vanished this is a history of our america is a frontier story on the sharp edges of history
58.74,64.23, i'm money dobson joined me as i investigate what happened in this city of mystery
66.03,74.97, lois like detective work this could be a shovel of dirt some rocks organic matter a little bit of vegetation
75.03,78.18, if you look closely and you know what you're looking for
78.21,106.02, it could be the voice of the dead
110.28,156.78, my journey took me along i forty four to saint louis missouri from there we flew across the mississippi river to the sight of one of the greatest mysteries of early america it all down there now cameralistic city our jobs desateful in our elongated find out what happened here standing in front of a hill that looks like it's a natural feature but it isn't it's man made more than fifteen million baskets of earth were moved to create a monument that two acres larger than the great pyramids at gaza
156.84,168.57, between the tenth and the fourteenth century monks mound is at the center of a thriving native american metropolis right here in the missippi bottom lands in cochinos
168.81,277.47, we call the people who lived here the mississippians and fact that's a name we apply to all of the people and the south eastern united states in the mississippi and period and it refers to the role of the mississippi river and ultimately the other river systems in the region in linking these peoples in places together we know they must have had a highly organized society but they left no written records so in the absence of birthrates newspapers and other sources we can use archaeology to decode what life was like for the coins to date dozens of mounds of been investigated what we have is one of the greatest mysteries of early america who were these people what were they doing here and what happened to them i met with my friend neal whose the director of the center for archeological research at missouri state university in order to learn more about the archaeology at cowan draw on the other gatherings furthermore infiltrations rates the way that stratigraphical up over time
277.83,284.91, instead of taking place over centuries here hundreds of times of trash are dumped every day
285.99,308.76, think about it the types of things that we throw away say a lot about who we are a people by rummaging around in the contents of this modern garbage dump were able to build a picture of what daily life is like for the average american we can find information about what kind of food that were eating for breakfast what brand of soft drinks we might like to have
309.36,321.93, find information about what we're in for dinner and a little bit about the latest fashions and inside we can find something out about trade networks
322.2,325.92, on some does have to do this
327.84,379.44, back at the coffee house with meal or professedly very complex society it's probably nine the sight itself alone is neither ten times larger than anything northvale mexico so itself whole other scale above other mississippi nor larissaean and historic as well part of the could say what fuel chocolate major increased agricultural intensification celia is the largest city in north america before the nineteenth century for the mississippians masefield the population growth one you can grow more food than you need to support yourself you can free other people up to specialize be creative and innovate
379.59,466.5, back at the coachman's visitor center i met with bill eisenmenger who's the outside archaeologist see if he could tell us more about the types of things the gorgons were growing a had a variety of crops one of the primary ones of course with corn or may and several varieties of that but they had a lot of other crops that were very important that as well that had been earlier and more ancient history in this in the mid west and eastern us things like marlinspikes and canada and the place being given as prestige gifts to subordinate chiefs in other villages in the mississippi and culture area
467.25,475.89, periscope the copper work shop was located in the area now known as mount thirty four
476.13,488.94, we're going to love me and to together of john kelly senior lecture in archeology of washington university in saint louis has worked at cahokia enceinte sixty nine he is currently excavating mount thirty four
489.45,532.86, no earlier from the earlier of there were potentially to copper workshops had been found underneath the malindore and we both hated the first evidence of the copper works and at that time all we had was an arrowhead little pastoralists to that were left behind harischandra
532.86,539.16, probably about this big and it's very thin i mean you can see the age of her what would less than a millimeter in
539.4,542.43, what we think they were doing is 
542.46,574.29, hammering nuggets into tenchester stone in a stone and working them into and then making a temple out of wood and then putting the shinto and hammering it into the temple so these are the two biggest pieces that we found but all of them had been hammered very very soon and they've all been cut they all have cut edges so what we know that they've been doing in this area is hammering it into sheepscott something whether they were trimming the edges or whether they were trimming out these negative spaces
574.32,584.91, like some of these usedn't know because we haven't found any finished pieces but it's not a native item in this art
585.18,648.21, michigan animals were starting to build up a picture of a major prehistoric city across the river from what is now saint louis with trade networks that stretched from the gulf of mexico to canada the people there are exporting agricultural surplus in exchange for prestige that the great sun or chief can give out his gifts but their gifts with some strings attached it's a bit like your local mafoos giving your brother in law job another thing to believe being produced here aloof these low figurines man of a reddish coloured stone these figures are expressions of the coincons their depictions of its gods goddesses and warriors and we see the finger and in many places throughout the southeastern us especially into oklahoma tennessee arkansas and other places and we think perhaps the message of good be even a new religion or a way of looking at religion as being transmitted and these are probably
648.39,667.38, roses of his religion religion has been a major component of every human society since before fred flintstone and his cronies invented fire by studying the religious practices of the people we can gain access to a window into their view of the cosmos
668.37,736.77, meanwhile the cohens worshipped the sun god they believed that the world was made of three parts and upper realm where the sun god lived a middle realm where men lived and an under world and right here hitomaru the great chief occupied a special place between god and man peveril power probably also had known squillae the populus to the sereth functions or less and we know that the great chief was considered the son of the sun in the conceives gender distinctions are less important than birthright and the great sun could be either male or female it was that birthright that gave you the privileges of power symbols of authority are all around us and we live in the shadow of political power every day combined the control of religious power and political authority and you have a potent cocktail indeed starting to build a picture of how the great sun is trade and gift giving to their advantage in order to gain power but why are the mounts arranged this way who organized the plan and why
737.73,793.14, back at mount thirty four i turned to john kelly for the answer lay look at life they look at the way in which the season cycle and so things are are born again for example the probably with created this mouthwash building that was here before the mountains bill and that was the important thing what we do know is that they totally rays that anything that was with that structure it was taken off the top and pushed over the side and so we have good evidence of that i mean that's where we find the piece of ingratitude idea of the smaller mounds came about but what about monks mound that enormous public works projects in the middle of ocean
793.17,827.31, mount like monks mound you know i got twenty two million cubic feet of earth in him that bert had to be dug up and to be by some people and be carried by others and to be shaped by others so it's got to be some one in charge of all that organizing and scheduling all that kind of activity this kind of extensive public works project would be paid for by a combination of slave and corey labor corlaer is similar to the kind of labor medieval surf would pay their landlord by working the fields
827.52,838.05, plus the grand plaza which is about forty acres in the middle of our sight here we find that artificially filled and leveled to the may god prepared platform for people to
838.05,878.91, then and rituals and ceremonies and other kinds of public activities so there's a lot of things that infested type of a social organization at this at another important piece of copious ideological landscape is would hang would angakout device a lot like stonehenge in england in reading the archaeology of cogia we can see that the sight reflects careful planning especially in the relationship between monks mound and wood had the chiefs house atop months mound is a line with woodencoat twice a year on the equinoxes it looks like the sun rises and sets out of the chiefs
879.57,927.0, class social class that is archeologists can read social distinctions in a number of ways food wealth burial all of these things are indicators of status but its proximity to power that speaks loudest of all other things they just burial can tell us about social class the libertarians can tell us about the social status of the deceased our friend birdmen here is an excellent example of a high status burial while he shall be might not make a comforter a resting place it tells us an awful lot about his social status his funeral bed is made up of twenty thousand shall beads and the shells are not from here but come from the gulf of mexico that distance makes them expensive and hard to get
927.0,996.87, and by throwing them away for ever with the dead our friend and his family were telling us something about how wealthy and how powerful they were that it had become important for them to do so may tell us something about how and why go and so were beginning to build up a picture of what life was like in cocaine to a thousand years ago we've learned something of the average person how they fed themselves who and what they worshipped and now they lived their daily lives at its height cohered over by a succession of powerful chiefs who acts as intermediaries between the gods and man in a bottega was the most powerful city in the mississippian world farmers produced abundant crops the rivers and surrounding land supplied meat fish a goin potters copper workers and stone workers produced stunning works of the highest artistic expression life was good for the average ocean but not for every one who lived there in part this is because they relied on the slave mode of production and the coins couldn't have known it but there whirlabout to fall apart
997.23,1038.84, sometime around eleven fifty the coaches built a massive defensive wall around their city i'm standing in front of a reconstructed section that demonstrates what the upright timbers would have looked like with their plaster covering this is also the same time that the outline villages are being abandoned it could be that the coins were undone by a combination of greed and warfare they wouldn't be the ferocity to end that way others have argued for much more insidious and we know that the coins practised human sacrifice and slavery and it could be that in the end this was simply unsustainable its
1038.87,1046.55, quickly but it's a gradual process starts in the elder so we start to see diminished
1046.64,1060.65, in here and so people are beginning to disperse it was still more ritual activity and morleena center and less of a population center but by the men serenaded a sight o biesenthal abandoned
1060.77,1075.44, by fourteen hundred the city is abandoned its great walls magnificent homes a rotting ruin what caused the demise and collapse of this city is a question that still perplexes archeologists
1075.47,1097.13, one possibility is suggested by the landscape itself the sheer size and complexity of the city placed an unsustainable drain on the natural resources of the surrounding environment and increased competition for the remaining resources may have led to warfare sides the helpless
1097.13,1154.7, bigger system southmere right and then you're coming down all the trees for fire wood for building houses or cabals other types of things for thousands of people for hundreds of years cut down the forest or cutting down to habitat and rely on her sicanians rely on your competing more for what left some conflict of warfare a kind of this domino effect society dependent on the richest of its agriculture would be hard pressed to survive a prolonged drought and there's good evidence for droughts in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries alternately famine due to excessively cold winters might have been the cause and we know that this was a period of a little ice throughout the world so in starting stretches
1155.18,1162.47, not unlike a post industrial city that's begun to exhaust its intellectual and industrial capacity
1163.16,1199.94, in the case of modern cities their collapses often the result of more than one factor general decay on employment more people than work and often corrupt leadership it's a lot like what might have happened to choke but to me some combination of all of these factors is probably where the answer lies famine disease degradation of natural resources warfare any one of these is enough to erode the power of the great chief the great sun occupied a place in the coach and cosmos between man and god and it was from this position that they drew their strength
1199.94,1216.89, and right to rule if the great sun could no longer intervene with the gods and bring victory in battle or insure a good harvest than they were unnecessary whatever the cause it's a compelling and fascinating mystery that archeologists are still unraveling
1216.89,1299.0, o money dobson verging on a stake curious i keep learning about the world around you thank you for joining me
