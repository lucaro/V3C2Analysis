989.94,1010.88, the lowest will bring in the exact repeat they want because they want to make sure it is exactly what they need and you know the stamper busy the congressman busy and so they frequently in the past and still avail themselves of the services lespoisse bills
1010.91,1016.55, now as a lobbyist what was your leverage in terms of getting members to sponsor the bills that you had written
1016.67,1026.18, lobbyist needs to get to the decision maker the congressman staff and that involves unfortunately financial conveyances
1028.28,1052.52, the dissenters in washington today is how much time members of the house and senate spend every week not just in the election season but all the time he around on the telephone asking people for money it's begging for money it's a sad spectacle when you have campaigns that are costantina dollars that people who have the money once something back
1052.7,1057.29, one is being used to buy results that is the problem it's how i use money
1057.35,1062.6, i know what i was doing washington is almost owned and operated
1062.66,1065.69, thus corporate sector at this point
1065.75,1206.39, so many billions of dollars of spending on lobbying there are so many lobbyists that are in the room writing the rags writing the laws right now there is so much financing of political campaigns there are so many but politicians or civic books tell us that the present is the most powerful person in the world and especial interest must go to washington to petition the government the women comes time to raise meliores go hateful to the people who really have the power in two thousand seven president george w bush made optimates armenian as for money for the republican national committee the secret service were coming for i would say three to four months before the actual visit and they would come every week just to check up look around the building they did background checks for sure they had the sharp shooters out they brought mister bush to mister schwartzmann's apartment he spent maybe fifteen minutes out and that it jonathan go to seven forty part would probably be foolish robin american and i'm running for president on a plateau with the prominent searchingness mister hartman's rang and meet some of his friends and no doubt collect a few checks may find for the country leaderettes go for an hour and when i tell him that statement the writing of laws the implementation of regulation the dread which the tax code tilt towards business and those of the top versus ordinary working americans a perfect example of the influence of a small group of millionaires can have in the government
1206.54,1222.05, is something of the tax code called carried interest provision it allows hedge fun and private equity managers like steve schwartzmann to pay a fifteen per cent tax rate on their income even though unlike normal capital gains they're not required to ristoro
1222.5,1232.58, i explained to people they think it's crazy the most highly paid financial executives get taxed at a rate lower than your mom and pop grocery
1232.82,1250.73, it is in the tax code because of the incredibly effective lobbing of the financial industry gay was a question about carried interest being taxed at a lower rate we sort of look at this as a sort of
1250.76,1255.32, an issue that's now in the political world and
1255.38,1272.42, it will be solved in that world we don't have much of a say in that sportsmen went to capitol hill yesterday and stood outside the senate chamber lobbying senators swartzman was there to fight against pirates on so called carried interest from two thousand six on
1272.45,1283.55, every democratic leader and president the case of president mama has said we're going to get rid of this unstained ramus to stop an taxes that are lower on the rates

1287.45,1302.78, before you know it the congressional session is ended and only god we ran out of time we didn't get to it we'll do it next time it appears the democrats have completed their takeover of capitol hill even when the democrats controlled both houses of congress they couldn't close the carried interesting pole
1303.5,1305.24, question is why
1305.3,1307.31, passed the house twice
1307.4,1308.96, in the senate
1309.29,1315.8, insolence schemer of new york the senator a street as he was done for many years

1325.55,1336.83, he became famous for his ability to gain wall street dollars that's why he was elevated within the democratic leadership and because he was such an effective fundraiser supernatural was

1342.17,1349.7, return this into an absolute running machine some helped the democratic party raise record amounts from wall street
1350.0,1423.62, and as the senate was considering legislation to close the carriage interest loophole sure when on a fund raising frenzy in that one month he raised more than one million dollars from hedge funds and private equity firms like blackstone the carried interest bill never saw the light of day some just very the idea it never came up for a boat and a committee or on the floor of the senate he gestured and and that i think is a perfect example of the way in which money talks in american politics today and nobody's moontalk loud and david cox this right wing oil tycoon with a fortune of twenty five billion dollars is the richest resident seven forty park over david and his brother charles run colinderies were the largest privately owned companies in the world they make things like discover towels like antimatter carpet but the most profitable business is oil and gas shells conustre bring in over a hundred million dollars in annual revenue together the colotes may have spent more money influence american politics than any one else in the country

1490.85,1588.17, they learned from that is they had to figure out another way to get their ideas to become influential so the coach decided to use their money to advance their agenda they gave generously political candidates but more importantly he invested heavily in groups that could bring their anti government ideas into the main stream the brothers gave millions to right wing think this and charles even found the one the libertarian cato institute government to bag at his getting beggar and we don't want a courage bigger government take the keys to the liquor cabinet away from the alcoholic shoals rode up in morasses to universities to support programs would moderation the free market economics their free market ideology they argue is just about principle but there are many many areas in which their business interests but in two regulations environments have been especially bad for the cocotte line an they've been slapped with numerous files from the environmental protection agency we are talking about millions of gallons of crude oil being released into the environment into thousand occidistis had appeared thirty million dollar fine or roll over three hundred oil pills at the time there was the largest civil penalty in the eastry when you make business is less competitive because there habitual with regulations from the environmental protection agency and other unlettered instead of creating jobs and a set of big alice with our foregoers we know it kills jobs this is too ahead of the brothers latest
