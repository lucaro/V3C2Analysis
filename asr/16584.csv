0.03,36.42, my wife and i were on a tour of china with a group of people and we were in hong kong and i was standing on the shore line next to a gentleman who was in his late seventies name is kimble said a number of years ago he had been in the military and on assignment in hongkong and he had been a swimmer and they had a competitive swim across hongkong harbour imagined the pollution in that doing that to day in any case
36.54,41.16, he was very frustrated because he did not win the race and used good
41.46,53.61, salt swimmer and he said i got him thinking along with several other people that there ought to be age brackets
54.27,60.75, swimmers and so that's how master swimmers got its start
61.11,63.57, simmer
64.2,100.8, have today a person speaking to us who is very sensitive and very interested in the idea of having a brackets and i imagine become more important to her as she gets up into her seventies and eighties and is still running on hope she saw running sharin's over sixty at this point and yet she is doing marathon she's doing races like sunday as i mentioned she's out doing this all the time because his passion and
100.83,111.87, makes it more fun to no people in your age group it's more fun to race against a competitive group that you can relate to
112.23,121.32, sharon thrives on our ability to compete and she wins road races which makes her an example for others to follow
122.91,127.41, how fast does she go and let her tell you that
127.44,144.3, and it's just a privilege to have her here she's an old resonant old granice she's local but she has a national reputation and with that introduction i minturn the over to share in boss
144.45,223.14, well hello everyone thank you peter for inviting me here to day it is a pleasure to speak to you all so you see someone running down the street you say yourself okay there goes a runner well i'd like to show you a little bit about her tallie bit about what's behind that runner the commitment that a run he has the assorting and whatever liberalities dalliance it wasn't just measure of my parents because they didn't have ultrasound and things like that back then i'm goin identical triplet and since you've had a chance to look at that old can guess which one i am
223.2,226.08, no takers
226.47,230.07, the right any other guesses
230.28,360.75, i'm on the left so that men the left my sister honour in the middle and my other sister shelley on the right shelley's first born on a second born and i was last born i went my sisters and i were in high school we actually decided with a group of girls to start a track team we were pre titania there were not a lot of women sports available back then we did do track this one year of high school part of a track event is a four by one hundred relay and that means that there are four members of a really tame each running a distance of a hundred well you can probably guess of those four members three of them were my sisters and i so what we also had a lot of fun as people say to us wait a minute didn't you just run how can you run again having you pass the town to yourself so we had to tell a lot of fun with that that maestrante living over seas at the time and we moved from belinda moved to apartment that was close to centralisation our apartment in new york city and waited to take a break we went to central park in the roll of these runners and my husband and i loved each other we had no clue what was going on so we asked and somebody said oh that's the new york city marathon well i didn't know what amarapoora and stark that's where the runners the last part of the race so we were watching them at about twenty three miles and we stood there for hours who were clapping and curing them on and a certain point we looked each other and we said well if they can do it weakened it that's how my running career got started and sure enough the next year in nineteen eighty five we signed up and we both ran our first marathon and
360.78,955.26, three hours and minutes and that is my first official marathon picture and my husband ran three hours and forty nine minutes and after that race i said never again don't ever ask me to do this i was so tired it was so hard i'd never done anything like that before then a couple of months later and thinking well you know maybe maybe i might want to do another one sure enough the following year i did new york again i ran three hours and thirty seven minutes and then i took some time off my first daughter was born in nineteen eighty eight and so i did not run that year and then in nineteen trained i ran again reiteration in iran three hours and two minutes so i had taken a half an hour of my time i thought ye maybe there's something to that maybe i can be competitive that's when i first started to train seriously i had some good coaches my time started to get better and i started to do more races and more marathon in nineteen ninety three i did the marine corps marathon and i ran three hours and one minute sir was getting really close to three hours in marathon there a certain sort of real special time markers to break three hours is very special in the world a marathon and discernment runners that can do it so that's a goal if you're if you're kind of in that rathskeller just because i thought it would be fun and because i had babists my parents were willing to watch the kids so sure enough we went up to seattle i was totally relaxed this was going to be something i was going to do surely for fani didn't care how fast i ran rosenau it was cold and icy i was just doing it to do it and i ran hagiosune was running the other way because he had finished his half marathon and i still had a lot longer to go and he yelled to me come on charayana her and i am looking like get hoo i had no clue that he was talking about the race was spread out i didn't see another woman at that point i had no clue where i was i wasn't paying attention to my you know time or anything like that so at the twenty six mile marker and remember that a race is twenty six point two so only had two tents of a mile left which is about a minute and a half of running i passed what was the first place woman so i entered the university washington football stadium i won the race for women and my time was two hours and fifty eight minutes so you can imagine for me i broke and i want rastignacorama miles thirty miles which is half a marathon but really my specialty is the marathon that's the thing i've been the most competitive in i do record all my training i record all my races that way i could look from her to hear and see how i'm doing see what i want to do in terms of training i have run forty seven marathons and that's a lot to my par which means a personal record or fast as time is two hours and fifty seven minutes and thirty seconds and for those of you that no about running and no about pacing that a six minute and forty seven second pace ermile and i did that in nineteen ninety four and the point ran at the marine corps marathon but of those forty seven marathons the ones i've done the most are new york of dunport and just by chance boston also fourteen i'll do new york in the fall othellos the reason i've done those to the most new york you know it's in my backyard it's easy to get to right but it's new york right everything is bigger better you got to do new york i've just and over again i love the course i love the challenge of it i love the atmosphere youghiogheny understatements shlessinger jennifer giving it congratulatory kissproof she was round so i love boston i'll keep doing it i've only missed one boston in the last seven years and by chance i was able to get into the london marathon which is a marathon i always wanted to do and i do love to travel for the races the big races like that bondfield have been there i was not there the how i found out about it was that i was already in england and i was suddenly getting all these emails and text with people saying to me charnock how's your family is anybody been injured returned on the news and of course followed it from then and that's how i found out about boston it was heartbreaking to find out that there were injuries and death i do not know any one personally that was injured but i know countless runners that were not able to finish as you may know that once the bombs went off they stopped they closed down the course of the stopped all the runners the runners to the understood it really was for the wolkensteiners going to take place because of what had happened but the odomantians of alliterative any security it wasn't necessary but after boisverte through cerulean airport morality it athenians to be able to take back to number on it and leave it untenable to pick it up later you can't do that any more now you have to take a clear bag that they give you you put your dry clothes in that clear bag and then that bad itasca before it is given to somebody to take to the finish line area for the boston marathon they don't not even allow bags at the start any more so that's definitely changed there's security along the course there bomb sniffing dogs in the waiting area before the start of a race they are sharp shooters on roofs their military personnel there are policemen of all these things that we didn't have before that's the way the world is now we have them having said that i have to command the race organizers because what they've done is they've kept the festive atmosphere there's loud music their balloons there's food there's music so even though we have all the security now the atmosphere is still fun and festive and they've done a great job of trying to keep that as much in the background as possible and as you can probably imagine if i'm standing on the varioloid with fifty thousand other runners i definitely do not want it
955.26,1232.16, feel unsafe so having the security makes him feel safe and just to show you before i move on here's a flight of london that was my biggest fan my husband yester is my age group of ward over to the right for my third place and my sister shelley who actually didn't run that one became to travel with me found me in the middle of the race so that is me running on the course speaking of london and some of the other races i've mentioned there is something that's called the world majors in marathon in and that is a special group of races new york boston london chicago berlin and tokyo and i have one goal of maman goal but one of my goal is to run too and another go with that would be to place in my age group into too because if i can do that i then run all the majors and i've been for second or third in all of them so that definitely golf mine in two thousand and fifteen i on my age group in boston reliant year but i was second in megicano and third in my age group in london so i only have tokyo left so i need to work on my husband we can do it what are some of the challenge that a runner might face well certainly the weather is a big one i run in the snow or run in the rain a run in howling wind i run in bed heat i remember one boston it was almost nine degrees they put up these tunnels or showers that the runners could run through to try to cool off because hers you can pass out if it's that hot in your really running hard on yer city marathon couple of years ago it was so windy it was twenty five miles an hour probably sustained in the wheel chair athletes couldn't start on the bridge they actually had to take them off the varioloid and they started them down below so the course was a little bit short for them but it was the safest they were actually rather when we did start on the course we started on the bridge and i remember being just little shoved sideways by the wind blown into other runners and i had a bruise on the inside of my right ankle because the wind was pushing my left foot up against my right foot that's how strong the wind was but you know not too much you can do about it two years ago i actually ran the boston marathon and they were saying it was going to be really good weather then they started to say we might have a slight chance of rain sure enough the morning of the race it was absolutely pouring and it was cold it was forty two but it was really damp and chilly thankfully i hate the cold but thankfully as she could see here on the left that me and the middle of boston you can't see it to all in the picture which could see how wet the roads it's absolutely pouring buttonhole picture over there i explained during the paris marathon i was getting water at about the three mile mark and someone inadvertently hove me they decided the last minute they need water they hadn't been paying attention they cut straight across and ran right into me my football would be a little bit telethermometer need to look at the foot stopped and i looked down and now delight she was bothering me and that was because my foot was like this big and swollen up so badly but what was like to do i had travelled to paris i'd always wonder run the paris marathon my daughter was studying abroad and that was why i had chosen that year to do it and who knows if i was ever going to get back to paris right so quitting was not an option i thought about it from moment figured out that what i do would i would just walk and run so i ran on and i walked a lot made it to the finish line i ran three hours and eighteen minutes which actually isn't that bad i'd had a great first half winterbourne spread
1232.22,1290.57, as you can probably see what i like to do certainly with my husband as i like to travel to some of the major races it's fun he runs as well he's run my marathon he doesn't do them any more but he does do a lot of the shorter races with me and we recently travelled to berlin again that's one of the world major and i was able to run reintegration never been back always wanted to go back lestrange city in amaranthine
1290.57,1724.79, way back when would never of imagine were possible the number of pick up where you get your running number was actually at the temple of which i'm sure a blood of you know was a major player in the air lifts it was really exciting to be able to be in the national historic buildings where history has taken place that picturelike warm we've changed our clothes were getting something to eat waiting for you know friedrichstrasse traverse when yonath and bits together i mean we all ran we all ran different times i actually won my age that year and my sister honor was second my sisters shallott didn't have a great race but we all finished he was a picture after the race with our medals and up in the corner you could see what a typical near city marathon metal looks like every participant of fifty thousand people will get that same metal i also go out to california both my sisters live in california and we did a race out there and we were one to an three o it's actually flourisheth will to run i know a lot of people that i used to run with don't run any more they can't for you know or they don't want to i started seriously running what i'll call later in life so it wasn't in high school or college sthenelus listened to my body i thort misrepresenting me i find doctor i understand my love of running and will get me back on the road as fast as they can and i try not to get too tight i mean i know you think oh my gosh he said a competitive runner but it's got to be within the right scheme of things in your life and i put it in the plainest overstress not be happy but by having other things as well in your life you can keep it in perspective and that keeps you going i mean you do want to do well and i am i and i do a lot of training and a lot of racing because i want to continue to do well but i'm not a street it is don't inhale a great group of running friends i've got women that i run with two or three times a week i see a lot of my friends at races that's one of the reasons why do retinues deerstealers friends are dissatisfied communal aspect to racing is not a solitary going out there by myself and distrain if it's cold dark and snow on a winter day and yes i do train out doors in the winter it's a lot easier to get out the door if you say oh my gosh in an hour i meeting so and so for a run so we do a lot of our training together for that reason i continued to love the challenge of racing you know each race is a new challenge it better time being gottesreich times now that i am forty so in my forties i always wanted to run under three hours for marathon in my fifties i wanted to run under three ten for marathon now under three hours and twenty minutes so probably kanonsionni new york seven times and i've been second in my age group three times so ten years in a row those of it my placing so i do get a kick out of being competitive i do work hard at it and that is one of the things that keeps me going what keeps me going the most though i would say that's my family you know my husband is there for me there are logistical things about running somebody's got to drive to the races somebody's got to meet the finish with my dry clothes somebody has to listen to me if i am happy or sad about my race and he's been there through all that is sightseers you know what it's like to work hard and keep that something i have an always met my time goes but i've always finished thieves have to be portentous and i hope they also with the gravitation we want to encourage them in their love of running to the attractions
1724.85,1777.23, in conclusion you could ask me you know what it is it to be running training and racing at the senior well it's all about loving to run it's all about having family support my two daughters at a younger age up there on the corner my husband is in the middle and on the right it's all about having friends to enjoy it with these are some pictures after races with some of my friends they ranged from to seventeen the complimenting goals in keep training because you have those goals i've met people i never would have met otherwise i have had a blasting to races i think i've stayed healthier because of the running and i hope to be running for many more years to come that's what keeps me going so thank you i'm capitano any questions 
1777.53,1790.85, understand that running a marathon is an incredible torment on your body how do you prepare for this assault and how do you recover afterwards for me personally you have to
1790.88,1796.94, basically have to be out there you have to train i train six days out of seven in
1796.94,1865.73, some shorter runs but i definitely about there doing the distance so i'll go out for a three hour training run you know the more you can do that type of thing the more your body's used to it you need to build it up slowly so that you don't get injured dolerite to your body and take the time off so that you can get to that marathon healthy you know and part of its lot part of it's just you know not getting sick and having the training through the race i see work and other races a lot of my short as rascally preparation for the marathon so i my body knows what is doing by the time i get to the marathon is well versed in you know trying to run a certain falters i always take time off i was put my feet up and have a beer at the first thing i do and then i take time off you need a week or two for sure of either not running or running and walking younger
1866.21,1891.14, i ever run in and bring cameronian to marine for marathons actually i'm sorry ever on the american marathons and marine corps was actually where i've run my fastest time now it's a great one busily american he is because you started the
1891.2,1895.7, on caermarthen ran
1895.88,1897.77, if you 
1897.95,1916.67, you consider on their way to georgetown royaliste bridge i see him come up to the lake and they go round the capital and be statesmen and then they do the silures
1916.76,1971.78, would allow and then they danced the pentagon again and if you walk the course of bridge you can see them come back at the dim romorantin think of any place for you could corianders indentations that reason and my husband did just that with our daughters he would go back and forth to see me one of our daughters ended up going to georgetown to that made it that much more fun for me and indeed you run by all the various memorials on the mall and that fantasticalities
1971.87,1973.55, the other questions 
1973.58,1980.36, do please tell us what kind of foot were you use share
1980.51,2030.91, not because i'm trying to plug them but i have always worn in a six running shoe that's just one of the brands it could be nicer anything what important everybody is a different type of runner for me personally a very light on my feet so i wear a pretty light shoe i tend to run more in the front of my foot i'm looking for something that's really cushioning that part of my foot i actually do my marathon and all my other races in what's called a racing shoe that's a really light shoe and i've been very fortunate that i've been able to do that not everybody can but what's most important is just finding a good cushion so that really fit your foot you know you need to go to a really good store where somebody can figure out how you run or walk and what's going to help support your foot the way you naturally
2031.96,2139.39, sharon in the boston marathon if one listens to the news reports i think it's the nineteenth mile there's a particular place where there's a particularly hard hill now as an elite runner is that an advantage to get rid of a lot of people or know what happens when you and how hard is that arpachshad haraldssen one as well basically is from nineteen to twenty one so it's a lot longer than people think there are actually hills astarte fifteen so although the course is known as being a fast down hill course it's the first half as fast and then after twenty one you start to go down hill again abandoning onpouring be able to as they say drop some other runners i was pretty decent and hills not grave a pretty decent in my younger days that's one of the things that happens as you get one recur you lose some of that power i have so i'm not as fast on the hills as i used to be so for me it's a little bit of a disadvantage actually tend to slow down but i'm still a good downhill runner so i turn it the other way around i don't worry so much about the people passing me going up hill i just try to pandora
2139.51,2142.9, question what is your resting heart rate
2143.05,2167.92, i actually don't know it let's measure it up the other question is when one looks at the beginning of say the new york marathon and you have these hordes of people on the bridge how do they sort them in order to measure the time because i know the elite runes are always placed up front but how is that organized so that every individual
2168.13,2179.98, his or her time measured that's a very good question and i will add that all races use basically the same system and then i'll tell you a little something about new york so
2180.22,2343.75, in any major race you have something that's called a corral and there typically certainly in the bigger races or maybe a thousand people in each corral those corals are based on time so when you sign up for a marathon if you run another one you will always ask on your form what was your fastest marathon based on that you will be assigned a corral so if your faster runner you're going to be in a crowd or to the front if you have no time or your lower runner than you will be assigned to a crowd more in the back your time actually does not start until you cross a mat at the starting line so even if you are a at the bag in it take you twenty minutes to get to the starting line your your actual official time is only once and you stepped on that man the timing mat at the start of the race a little fun fact about new york for me because i have been successful in my age group in new york i've been able to receive what's called the civetta so the elite are the canyons the olympic champions those types of runners they get paid to come and raised in an of course their winning prize money at the end there put up in hotels everything's taken care of for them for someone like me and i appreciate fromenteau they want the competition to be good if someone's going to win in a truth wanted to be someone that is you know some of the faster runner so what they have done they have offered me and a small group of runners what's called a subaltern what we get as we get a special bus that takes us from matamata over to the fort wadsworth there's a special area where we can formulate to eat relax if it's bad weather were inside they then take us as a group and there may be thirty of us they take it as a group and they walk up to the start and we actually get to start in the front so the only people in front of us are the truly runners the ones that are going to win the race it is a thrill for me when i'm going to start the near city marathon i am literally at the start of fifty thousand other runners so for me i haven't very easy great start but the other ones don't need to worry because indeed their time doesn't start until they start that man
2343.93,2347.68, i tortoises
2353.83,2391.39, absolutely i mean they will never be the winner because of course the race is now who the elite are but for instance a good example earnestness indeterminate
2391.6,2395.59, their time is faster than they on that age group absolutely
2395.68,2405.49, that's also why they don't immediately declare the eighth group winters until they've been able to check all the statistics and verify the times
2406.09,2453.4, i am decorous with guard to the age group is how far up to the age groups go in terms of actually people competing wetherill first of all age groups are every five years some of the smaller races they do it ten years but certainly in the big races its every five years in many of the races they now go up to either plus or a anthelminthicum
2453.43,2487.66, i as all of us here now as we age or abilities to finish and you've mentioned how you have adjusted your goals as you moved up at aseptic different times lots would you talk about how you adjusted your training chartered the changes in your body and ability to train share i first of all i try to run six days out of seven i define i want of these people that needs the movement as my physical therapist says to me your some one i'm going to
2487.81,2510.82, keep running instead of saying don't run i just need that that's how my body functions best but i've cut my mileage whereas i may be running weakly mileage of servile a week i now running forty and fifty and that's what i'm actually training for the marathon i used to do to speed work
2511.0,2584.59, sessions a week so i would go to the track i would do you know i try to run as fast as i could six times which is twice around a lap so i would be doing speed sessions like that now it typically do one i find that i need more retaliating in given up but i now use those races as my speed work so if i'm going to race chances are i'm not going to do another heavy speed work i may do something light what we call a tempo which is kind of you go out there and you run and you're running it what you think you might run a marathon at but a beadwork is your running as fast as you possibly can and that's different and that it's harder in your body you have to recover from that recovery is slower it takes longer as you get older and so i just generally listen to my body and if i'm really tired or i think i am starting to get a cold or something like that i also back off i'll also skip a day now whereas before i was really a head at all planned out i knew exactly what i was going to do and if i was going to run three miles that day i was going to run through masada now if i'm feeling like i might be getting a cold or i'm just very tired for some reason i may skip that day
2584.77,2623.71, you prepare for the possibility like a cold and you back off you rest have you prepared for maybe that david you will run again now i hope i mean i know what's always a possibility but i hope that whatever life throws in my way that could potentially mean that i don't run that somehow i can find a solution to keep running other than some sort of you know devastating tones or major injury that would mean that i simply can't i intend to keep running
2624.07,2634.9, and my father passed away and my mother just passed away a couple of weeks ago at night so i think i've got a good chance of making it but we'll see 
2636.73,2643.09, i am running seems to be a family affair in your family 
2643.09,2653.14, indiferent a grand parents show any sign of unusual stamina or can any apology person
2653.17,2667.69, determined to train became a marathon candidate so my parents did not do any sort of sports i actually don't like my father i suppose you could 
2667.72,2708.07, stamina just because i always looked up to him certainly as the stories that i had you know i heard from him during the war i always felt he was a very strong individual but in terms of sports now they always encouraged us to do sports but they were not doing sports themselves i think we were sort of borneo
2708.91,2759.1, doesn't do anything he he's not trying to be at flood what i will say is this never see never any one can do exactly what i did i could not run a mile so when i was living over seas and holland actually we were belgium at the time my husband another male friend and i decided we were going to have a little competition to see who could run a mile first so it took weeks we went out there he kept trying he kept trying well i won but the point of that is i could not run a mile without walking and if somebody had said to me at that point will you're going to be a running twice six point two miles without stopping all the time i'd say you're crazy so it takes training it takes commitment but anyone can do it i mean it's not that you necessarily
2759.1,2798.07, you may not have the success that i had and i do contribute that to just my natural ability to run but you definitely can run and when you see the marathon a lot of people do these races for different reasons i do it for the competition there are people that are out there for charity that may not be doing a lot of training but they just want to be there there are people that do it because they want to travel and they just want to be a part of something and it looks like something fun and big and you know it dorothy want to do it sooner
2798.34,2837.64, hopefully work their way up there's no much does not like everybody has to run a marathon there i tell some of my friends that really they then reason for them to run a marathon because they're so successful at the shorter distance and to their different body types there is something called slow twitch and fast which muscles and i definitely have the muscles for the longer distance some of my friends have the muscles for the shorter distance and if i had to run a short distance race to get them i'd be blown out of the water so much faster than i am but it a marathon i would then beat them so any one can do it you just have to work up to it slowly 
2839.35,2931.33, i i two questions do you compliment your training with strength training and if so what do you do and secondly in that time period where you improve from three twenty seven to three or two whatever was what did you do because that's an enormous aim going to be very ashamed to admit this on the first half of that question i don't follow the way i do it i don't do a lot of strength training or what's called cross training i always tell myself to do it i think for me because i've been successful in the big certainly you know in the beginning just running and getting faster i got kind of stuck into the pattern of using all my free time to go running i think the reason i've slowed down on those hills is because i've lost some muscle masses i've gotten older and if i was to do some weight work i think that would help every year i tell myself after my race occasion next marathon you're goin to do wait work it's like with everything else in life you need to make the time to do it and you have to have the commitment to do it i'm working on that i've got some years left to try to improve on that in terms of that big drop in time i think two things happened for me i think i was still somewhat of a novice runner so you know many people all of a sudden the race times will just get better i think it was because i was still sort of in that beginning phase of my running i think
2932.17,2994.57, having a child makes a big difference your carrying around that extra weight your long and passive gets a little bit more efficient so i think that after i gave birth to my first daughter and that was then the following year that i ran i was just a little bit stronger i think i was stronger and my lungs i think i was stronger my body having to hate work with all this extra weight that i was carrying i also pushed her in a baby dagger so i was one of the very first in new york city a head it's like three wheels it's too in the back of one of the front and then i used to put her in as a baby into this it's almost like a sling if you will that she could come to blannerhasset pushing her andromeda better runner so i think that those are the reasons that i was able to drop that time i think also i was just probably
