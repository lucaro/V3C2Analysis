33.81,37.71, welcome the first port of tamerlane fortune
37.74,53.85, they still will reap another exciting teaparty football in bellyband weaken with the full diacatholicon sweeter waterproof at the bottom to connect first become out of the show than abandoning finish to your team this past week in the national quarter finals but
53.85,61.77, we have to be proud of what your teams achieved here another season absolutely it's hard to get into that final you know final aid
61.8,75.15, so let you know only left and last year and in the final four so ah fergettin closer we know aright there you know the frustration
75.18,78.45, exist in that you know we're so close and
78.48,81.12, i think the back it would have set up really
81.24,85.23, favorable as i think we would have been planned home again
85.26,87.0, in a game
87.18,89.61, on and
89.85,105.48, i don't see that national power there's good teams obviously but there's not a northwest missouri state in a wit so much better than every one last year they dominated the national championship game and feed us in the semi so that's a little frustrating
105.48,117.24, really close and we'll keep on growing and obviously you have to be proud of your senior class and even over the past four years and foresters to the division to play he adds hired to be in the play as you know as
117.42,135.78, everybody everybody fights for that is one of the goals and so for us to do it for your sorrows were taken for granted but it feels good to do but we want to buy entwisle thing and a little frustrated that we
135.81,147.12, or out of it but a parting a lot of credit they were really good team as it goes soight o from this game obviously new coming in a harding with a option based attack and was going to be tough to stop
147.15,176.34, i know it's going to be tough you know the hard part is the three to four yards on every play you know they don't have any negative a place and so you know the first period here they they knock out ten minutes so we knew we had limited possessions we knew as can a glint first to settle and the end oneness good at what they do and give them a lot of credit for that 
176.4,203.46, start back we thought we could throw quick on him and were successful with the foremost part but we had to make penalising place a couple of sacks that coster often you know do not be sufficient in his somewhither hand takes along with so you know four plays hand and were head seven to three and then we stopped them and then we you know we knew we couldn't make critical
203.52,205.77, in this game and not
206.22,208.35, the pontus
208.71,212.88, you know we gotta make something happen and when he thought the pick here
212.94,218.82, give them a short you can't give them the ninety five yards short for them you know 
218.88,220.92, so then the end up going
220.92,228.96, we had but you know five places in the whole first quarter and ended up scoring here to go ahead
229.41,234.81, defecation drive play pretty well here against a team that like to move the ball in the ground
235.74,248.31, we know there's going to be a settling in process with how unique and you know not facing that it often and so we knew that would be a challenge but after a while or defensible man and
248.43,250.11, you know
250.11,254.4, in there and just got worn down at the end we need to make them play
254.67,263.4, here we had a possession where radient out at first down and travis came in and that was the key dry we needed their kind of get her deepened and
263.43,268.35, allow allow the office benefield for her for at least a
269.28,279.03, a drive where the slow them down a restrainable to do that to a bunch of harrington a second touch down around the boat gelatine third quarter congaree to fifteen l
279.21,286.2, i you know obviously scary situation and that we are only had four in the thin but 
286.38,291.36, to be had after paying all that well you know felt good 
291.36,296.25, a third down long play which is so short at ponteallen
296.4,301.38, ah then our detested up here in this ethical
301.5,304.35, it when we needed to have that possession
304.44,306.3, the ball
307.17,309.27, tickler
309.36,313.29, porter got a little piece for the ball there so we are probably
313.5,317.31, the intercessor of black and the
318.45,327.51, harboring a for you guys but especially if for your seniors and a group that's matalista eidothee been incredible um
327.54,335.01, look back at it and you just think of all this success we've had you know right now you're just in misery because
335.1,343.44, you want to be you know continued the season and obviously don't want to lose that way we weren't at our best and
343.53,355.92, particularly offensively we needed to help the defense and we were not able to do that and so there's a little frustration obviously but looking back and after porcel away a couple of weeks
356.13,360.15, it's just an unbelievable for years for
360.15,376.8, everybody who's been a part of this but our senior especially they've been outstanding and they've been unbelievable representative of you know what what you want him to represent as his college student athlete you know they've been evolved and commiserate had been involved in representing
376.83,391.2, that represent in its fury proud of them as i looked back over the year a talk about the adversity your team face in terms of the injuries obviously the weather at times and how they responded as arapeile honest with her it was you know to some
391.2,393.3, aside for sure
393.36,397.71, and people taiarapu know your eleven and two but
397.71,403.11, one of those years where we just had to fight and grind for everything that we got
403.11,406.77, proud that we are able to do what we did under the conditions
406.83,408.48, challenges
408.48,411.42, they were confronted
411.42,415.77, so you know it was incredible for sure and
415.86,438.33, a lot of guys stepped up we had to play a lot of guys so hopefully that both well for a future but though we feel good moving forward but we're going to say they miss the seniors as move forward now all obviously into the recruiting saintete geared up for spring ball or just talk about what transpires here between allenboro you know it's a funny thing but i 
438.66,450.15, in the play of a most intolerant or sometimes recruiting you know those guys said a recruiting against her out there selling kids on it commit to us now and saw teleon people
450.18,468.72, now we were you know we were the team that went the further end the great the last two years now and so you know i mean we were the team that allowed people should want to take a hard look at and so they shouldn't be jumping to conclusions and getting pressured by those who have had time to
468.81,480.99, pressure young people because it's all they have to do and so we're here to tell them you know see what parson has to offer because obviously we've been havin successful and and her kids
481.05,490.26, and our coaches created a number culture obviously hero or the next month it what happens in during the recruiting passage ready for signing 
490.74,499.08, you know it's part of being a coach he'll be one with her that from now until signing day it's the hardest part
499.08,501.75, so we just going to have to go out there and
501.75,504.69, the bushes we have a pretty good idea who

747.93,751.32, is a very difficult being for a roll peter
751.32,752.76, play in because
752.97,777.39, seeing some opportunities they have but it was really few and far between so you know at one end you watching the guy have to really make save after save and then an ear and all the sudden and all you'll get a shot and it's really a mental focus then here's a go great shot by travellers of all to that was a huge goal we need that they have a little bit of reading room
777.54,790.41, at the end of the second period you are able to hold on down the street in the third period is just in capital master in that had a nice night for you get this fishery burns the shutter which a beaver few chances

798.51,800.31, also to
800.4,809.52, prithee as they make their push in the third i thought he really earned the shot out as he pleased it was penellan weekend patron the ten

818.55,895.62, very happy with that i thought one of the players had really a strong weak and was craigleith nice to see him get rewarded on sardinia couple goals but he really had what i consider one of us better weakened to the air after toothache back saturday night and part of a busy day in the fairest catastrophes
895.71,917.55, recoiling you one another on to the second period talk about going into the second period and obviously you were able to get the second goal here at early in the secretariat gold
917.55,926.1, incorrectness same spot of the head the night before but we did talk extensively in logwood

951.66,958.56, again it was late powerful gods great pathriot
958.65,970.17, and then here was what i considered a big world for man's left in the game this gives us a tow cushion again and it makes life a little easier i know they're still pushing but
970.26,1083.93, the four generally were to win that game at the empty matter it is you know with a five to scores like we hated and that we did that the game was up for grabs right titanotheres last five minutes for stray wanahon homicidally had to protect or hominal to do that yet it always start off the ear o three and one are five and one and conference and senoritas of side of about five hundred now i know a first goal every year to make the play of a attended her bantering hetherington
1085.91,1115.94, at first university the designer then informer temerity
1115.94,1139.13, but back to the right side recitation fictioneer of adoration
1140.24,1145.19, come ride with us for more information visit bare staple on doom
1146.0,1175.7, i fear state university were more than our students alteration more than variety of programs are internship rate or number soon organizations here here never just a number yourself and before us on the gold the inspired every day and be ready for to morrow we bolingbroke
1184.34,1190.97, welcome back to fairport oftentime to tuck will by ballingall with us had cotterell helots for awesome show
1191.12,1200.84, i have a faction to get on another great season and now i like football that he in the way you wanted it to but certainly a tremendous reason that you have a lot to be proud of for your team
1200.93,1203.54, a couple of days removed we can look back at
1203.66,1208.85, the growth that we had this season and the improvements as
1208.88,1219.05, individuals and as a team and be happy you know for certainly we happy for that and celebrate that is definitely would feel a lot better if we were so plain to day though he
1219.05,1236.78, overall and a seventh straight trip to the incitement to twenty second program history obviously a proud tradition here for perseverance to have that i guess i didn't even really realize that till you bring that out but you know they were not usually coming these kind of things but it is nice that
1236.87,1274.25, that were able to be a part of a subway tournament and that we're able to be you know to do well in the tournament and it's nice that that's somewhat of an expectation or players feel like that's something that they want to work toward the personalities
1274.25,1281.75, defense a lot on tintop those two players and in a slow madonnino there really the catalans
1281.93,1293.42, when not here in the south come back and take the second said to wandsworth at yeah i thought that in the second set we knight away from our game pina little bit
1293.51,1297.62, and we stopped you know fulfilling our assignments out there and
1297.71,1316.82, really running the offense the way that we wanted to so i think the discometer better had of ourselves and maybe loses little bit and then when you know when it wasn't going well we definitely didn't you know i keep out a confidence going away that we needed to imagine tournament named at the alteration
1316.82,1320.15, to really do have a nice tenement i think over all
1321.08,1334.13, we are able to get her to ballinore good situations and she's the kind of athletes that in five play it that will work to create hard for one to so she had a nice sum offensive turn in my assessable she had quite a few digs
1334.31,1341.03, and after the intimate twenty five twenty but then for satiable to pull away for a twenty five twelve victory
1341.39,1347.99, i think at that point it was just you know heartening account didn't quite bring their game at that point we were still
1348.05,1355.37, you know definitely more point with the game plan that we wanted execute so i think those two things together just give us a little bit of a run
1355.46,1360.08, alene play unimportant here in the intolerant heavensent this season
1360.44,1372.56, rendering you know so there's the good of they don't know us very well we don't know them very well we are able to get a couple of matches on from their season and you know i have a little bit of idea what they wanted to do
1372.59,1407.81, he overran the opening round and then come back on friday one night later take it on the number one see the whole lesson just talk about the match eh louis insists on our very tatterhood team you know they have three all americans on their team and very good players and then a couple of others that are rarely strong as well how we saw them twice this year we knew them pretty well and i was so now played them a couple of times the last couple of years so it's in the unlettered fourteen in the country you know very good team so and when you ildabaoth
1407.81,1415.85, we had to be very focus is a really fast turned around for the ten when you're no work a few days toreador kendahland and then you get into the moist
1415.85,1418.13, the withering the little bit
1418.31,1430.34, here toinette five twenty one but certainly very much right in it here the opening to a and louis is often as fast as in a come out really strong under the gate so i thought the fact that we handled that
1430.37,1436.28, and we got into a lover with our game plan you know i thought that really helped us ailie second and third set
1436.49,1441.41, for said obviously you've got two big ones there they go ahead and the match to one
1441.68,1452.24, it was great i was it wasn't quite enough you know i thought we were destroyed in that period plainly study disturbance the more really worried about what
1452.39,1457.31, behind us or had about foreseeing the moment definitely in the force that
1457.4,1463.76, you came out really showing a eacides to telepathy came out a really strong and just
1464.03,1469.85, the horse and got a billycock lead and were able to sustain that hottentot that whole set
1470.09,1478.31, the first said a challenge that always is in bloodpressure on that fish said when you're trying to keep your season alone yeah i think
1478.58,1484.04, and again i don't know that we necessarily were feeling that kind of pressure other than you know it's just
1484.1,1496.34, where you are you know we complain post season offer while over a month now you know feeling like every mathild was a must win cinating on to achieve our goal so you know that patatras in any different than
1496.43,1507.29, then the other match that would be playing we just weren't able you know to execute quite the things that had been working for us earlier in the match and as they will stop a couple of things in
1507.29,1571.52, he shortly you have five seniors all your play hermanmann lewis and a group that achieved the great deal of four strike a titteringly eternities the first time that ever happened in conference story eh and nance fantastic i couldn't be proud of for them so happy for them such a great group they really you know a year ago we really challenge them to work to step up into the strong leaders for this team and all five of them were out there in leaving and all five of em you know from last december an every week they worked to get better in their leadership and and i spent a lot of time and energy and improving themselves as individuals in proving their leadership and proving their volley ball and i just wouldn't have achieved what we did this year without that growth of those five had missionaries here between now and to get ready for next fall assorting about athenian
1571.58,1597.23, getting under way and you know and people thinking about that but for seniors they're getting the transition into the next phase of their lives you know getting real jobs and graduate school and being able to move on to some other things so there's a lot of new and exciting things happening so i think right now we know foster
1597.53,1632.06, sure the growth of the seniors i mean i just astounded at the work that they did in the dedication to his team in this program and the culture of who we are i think that the conceit out tell stories about for five ten years you know they'll come back to a game and i'll say that's the one remember toast and i think that's definitely a thing that stands on the molestation players like oil be going back and certainly a lot o work that they'll have to do to try to fill those shoes
1632.06,1641.99, certainly rely on a great season i been a great run here and yet the proud of what first bully balconies to accomplish the really happy potentiometer
1642.02,1650.9, to do it for fairport up eminence all the eggs an online at first bulldogs will be back next to master so stay with us right here on parrots update
