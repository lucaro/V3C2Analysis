0.57,325.8, twenty years ago my parents decided within a go and live in the united states my dad came to this country where nothing from india they wanted a better life for the kids they taught my brother and i to work hard be honest and make a good living if you do those things correctly i feel no matter what you try and do you always accomplish or go the first thing we did before we opened this put a giant flatened states right behind our counter this country is given me everything this town has given me everything there's no other place on this planet that can give you the opportunity that's here right here in america on top of that you live in the most amazing town and the country kingsport and that is a very unique mixture in notes over the week end or something but there is not a single question i asked him in terms of something new that i read about or something that a recipe that i want a try doesn't matter what conserving not you can robespierre that is built around family we don't have employees here we have family disguise my brother men i went to his wedding i went to into his house he's not my boss idiot looked at as an employee laughter than happy to get it for you and welcome me into his home basically a great store and found the winds that i traditionally drink great price as a good guy love the store he's very very good customers and he finds a lot of the things that people wouldn't normally find one thing that such a support from onlookers in this community is that we deliver one particular customary command and in seven party he didn't know what to order how much to order we went above and beyond we put the order together for we also delivered it to his house and in speaking to him between ordering this sat hetherington him i was a bartender and i actually went and delivered the stuff and worked upon for some getting married or harmsworth and he's not he's a home there the best way is to possible but say saving some money or just having some great ideas he might even part down on their ideas like listen there's delineates couple things and the customer i'm sure is very appreciative he's not just that way with me he that way with the whole town you know it would be throwing their husband a birthday party in this and to tell him i bought all this liquor because you know it's going to ruin the surprise i can i pay for it and i cannot put it aside can you guys hold him for us and we sat surelier i can you deliver it to avenue in the venus not close by you know it's not in kingsport might be in smithtown and might be out in montalme a delivery we go the tamarinds before for example a girl friends coming over she loves them i even if i had the right things he'll say okay i got a have you know bababalouk sure i have those things like he's like i don't tike wot that before malecontent you home wiseman the first question is how much is it an he'll say no no no no i'll get you a smaller bottle of sixty nine it doesn't make me uncomfortable at all to ask them the kind of questions they have the answer and the same time they can recommend something that's valuable a thing it hopes great only in my putting a product in their hands that they possibly could like i can give him fifteen other examples of what they could use you on a cook with if you want to you know drinkers i genitals or for a different variety of that type of product and they feel really comfortable at that point and not just somebody here tribesman a sail i opened with literally twenty products on the wall kings parker's would come in blitherin where is the liquor and i said avenue concept so i kind of relied on them and i would say within a month or two the shells were packed and it was because you'll never see the type of variety anywhere else than ours because everybody is suggested something i drink this i want this this is what i get all the time so you will see in every section the major brands but you always see a handful of different items that you'll never find anywhere else to put those are unique to kingsport it's what the community has requested and it's built for them if they had instauration sometimes we have tasting going on all them try it if they like it and based on that we can help them find exactly what they need for that night caporal takes a bribe into their town and that is the underlying reason why any small business in this town is successful is because of the residents of kassa
