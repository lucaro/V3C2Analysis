0.03,13.35, thanks and so for many years now and it's been many years i've been asking myself this one simple question what is the origin of form
14.79,27.36, how do we invent for him where do we begin how do we think of generating a product building a city a piece of clothing how we start to think about this process
28.83,38.4, is it a preconceived image of a narrative do we design form by immaculate conception the
38.55,51.66, is that a matter of getting rid of the stone that is in the way as michelangelo once pointed or perhaps it is an idea about technology and optation and function
52.17,56.34, but if indeed form is to follow function
56.49,60.3, how is that function tested evaluated
60.39,61.8, late
61.98,63.69, according to whom
64.17,67.65, by which criteria this is a farm
67.95,75.66, no magistrature for the naked and so it has been my assumption that
75.96,84.9, designed by shift of perspective may be considered perhaps a second nature
85.23,100.32, and it is in the prospect of this natural way of making things that i've over the years accumulated a set of design research experiments with the aim of formulating a new design approach the disunited by nature
101.97,114.24, and so the pioneers of such a design approved are few but like buckminster fuller and like frigate their immense immense in stature
114.57,126.09, and so there are my heroes my nineteen nine there were the form finders of the seventies and they've asked themselves not at an object wants to be
126.18,129.3, rather what is the material one to be
129.6,140.43, an environment want to be those who are the generation of designers that developed hands of approach to design
140.7,163.11, and it is in the spirit of such intellectual predecessors that have left us with his legacy of a natural way of making things that has profound implications of the way in which we make things in the world to day and also great significance as to how we perceive this set of ideas about sustain ability
163.74,176.79, how do we begin to think about natural design so i began by searching for answers and nature and it was early on when i discovered that nature authors not forms
176.79,186.36, processes to think about for recipes that makes material and environment together and it is due to those mixtures
186.54,189.9, those relationships that form emerges
190.23,199.71, i began collecting and matting and classifying all sorts of types of precedents and procedures and this is essentially one
199.71,216.81, of my entire peace detestation and i've developed method called computational enabled formed finding which has to do with bringing together material properties and environmental constraints mixing them together
216.96,228.0, generating form out of them and so the idea is that a designer could then approach those tools and use them in different ways he becomes an editor of constraints
229.68,258.27, and so instead of designing two or three dimensional forms and then sending them off to the engineers for analysis whether structural analysis environmental analysis and intimations traditional ways that were thinking about design the idea here is to ask how do we put design on its head and we start from analysis we start from environment we start from material properties and we generate three dimensional form out of this process
258.54,267.33, so before we moved into computational algorithms i just a few words about what can a true for us and what tante
267.51,281.4, so i wanted to focus on two of nature's greatest features that have been a great inspiration for my work have always been and will always remain and those are those falling to features the first one
281.58,299.22, that nature is a grand material engineer we already know that it can generate avalanches which are twice as tough as our high taramis in a ingenerate so courteous five times stronger than steel so it knows how to organize matter
300.03,319.44, nature also designs for the multi functional alias structure can support itself structurally while at the same time converting light into sugar in the process of photosynthesis this is are they lunch i've heard to day also are muscles
319.44,325.23, support ourselves mechanically but at the same time they manage and conserve our energy
327.87,331.02, there are a lot of things that nature cannot do
332.19,349.68, it is so arranged the trees do not grow into the heaven this is from detersive and poetry and white cant trees go and grow into the heaven well because nature has not invented paeans have and this is why we have this cigar
351.63,360.66, nature has a work with wheels either we use wheels for movement nature uses other mechanisms for inherent
360.9,365.61, interestingly is precisely those criteria
365.7,379.2, production for us nature masculinization or universes nature multi functional design that industrial evolution rejected completely and up to this day
380.37,398.43, and so i grew up with this image my parents are both architects and my dear father presented me with this image many many years ago this is the first glass case goes state skyscraper meet by nisida from the nineteen twenties and it sort of the antithesis of
398.55,406.59, my reason for being here in this world which is separation the separation between materials and functions
406.62,419.82, there is telstar of the structural performance of the building and glass as a sign the environmental performance of the building right so separations of materials to different disport functions
422.07,437.76, so we beat nature in size and speed to a certain scale range and you'll hear more about how we don't buy church but there are a lot of things that we are we harangued
437.94,447.15, because of those pumps and those wheels right we waste steel we waste oil winepress or carbon footprint to an unimaginable rate
447.21,453.87, and so the next question is how do we begin to think of a natural way to design
454.14,458.25, but yes and utilize those principles of nature
458.28,461.61, in scales to match human production
461.91,468.03, brace ological advancement can we think about a nature
468.33,471.33, point in the shade
471.78,478.35, i mean to be to nature to day what does it mean to design in a sustainable way
479.88,486.93, and so if you understand the same as you understand my entire work um this is
487.23,489.45, membrane of an egg shell
490.05,515.97, this is how nature makes things and like most objects and artifacts of mother nature is made of fibre the fibres are articulated in such a way that they distribute the loads equally on the surface area of the eggshell while at the same time said the system material engineer while at the same time multinational ity they allow for food absorption he exchanges tetra
516.09,522.33, there's a lot of functions that are incorporated just by controlling those materials and designing them
524.79,536.1, and so in the spring of two thousand and eight i have been approached by a palatine for her show designing the elastic mind in moments and she asked me to design for new objects for
536.1,537.24, so
537.48,544.98, i was terribly excited but i decided instead of designing for objects i would design for processes
544.98,552.87, so instead of designing for objects or four forms i would design for processes for the generation of form
554.7,559.29, the underlying theme for the generation of those processes
559.41,567.96, exactly the idea of multi functionally the idea that a structure can sustain itself structurally with can also conduct he
568.08,570.3, conduct their game
570.57,583.86, and so remember me again the antithesis of mice were moving onwards towards a designing and engineering systems that incorporate performance criteria
583.89,591.0, and so monaco was my first project it stands for french a structural skin from the bonedust
591.33,638.16, and the share stress line and the surface pressure are embodied in the surface by the location and the relative thickness of those vain like elements that are built into the skin so this structural skin was three printed much like we do tropinin but of just three printing three dimensional objects from two materials the black dark material is sittin cares for the structural performance of this building skin and the white material is soft it let like through and it lets temperature and he exchanged through so again the designer as here she is designing to manipulate the sickness of those vain like elements depending on the type of load and the direction of that load
640.14,641.85, the maps
641.85,659.52, an experiment in reconstructing natural tissues by controlling fiber direction ality so you start from micrographs from biological specimens you understand how material behave and you scale up this behavior not only in dimension
659.58,665.13, again in terms of its physical articulation of the fibres this is a butterfly scale
667.23,673.14, and as much as nature scalp sand and soil with air and with water
673.26,695.25, at counting was a project that the theme of which was scalping with light and so the designer can control the thickness of this translucent surface by relating it to constraint of light performance by deciding how much shading he or she desires in a certain space
697.14,726.9, so the designer again becomes kind of gardener an experimenter that generates lots of options a clearly glass house in iceland would behave in a completely different way than a glass house and the hardest and so were generating lots of options just like her melanesians and different geographical locations were generating different options were eliminating them and were working towards environmental fitness
727.59,736.92, now environmental fitnesses and idea that nature is no very very well and it is pronounced in a very elegant way in the human bone
737.04,741.63, human bone has the capacity to modulate itself
741.78,770.64, as it is alive to be models according to structural loads so it was julia swell who discovered in the late henry that the bone has the capacity while stimulated with additional weight to build more little beams more tried back uli more calcified structure and to change its structure as its moving so it's doing the analysis the modeling and the fabrication in one process we don't
770.97,807.21, separate between modeling analysis and fabrications and so when we go to outer space we lose pontisse when we become pregnant we gain this point issue and so the bones exactly how to adapt its material organisation how to work towards multi functional and castigation depending on the type of load so so now that we sort of understood those major general and abstract ideas how are those ideas from the world of art and from the world of design come to portray themselves and more practical and
808.29,812.94, applications in the medical industry but also in technology
813.45,830.31, so always ask not what science can do for design what but what can design do for science so what can design do for science or can design do for technology so we know that we can using those algorithms to day we know we can malot
831.03,832.98, we know that we can map
833.37,842.49, we know that we can make light but what about the medical industry can we import some of these understandings
842.64,845.52, design better medical devices
846.0,848.4, and so what about the mapping of pain
848.64,862.83, and to paint is the less personal thing and it's a different between individual and individual it has always been difficult to map and it is always been poorly treated by the medical industry especially western medicine
862.83,870.33, and so here the idea was to come up with a project that is a process that i call second skin
872.31,882.99, and the idea of second skin is basically to map the pain profile of a particular patient and to distribute hard and soft materials depending
883.02,887.4, on his or her anatomical or physiological pathologie
889.47,899.79, project was inspired by animal coating patterns only instead of color were now controlling stiffness great graduation so instead of the different colors that emerge
899.85,910.2, for those animals were controlling the material properties and i've been lucky and honored to collaborate with professor cried carter from the department of material science admit on this project
910.2,921.03, so we've designed protective love against carpeted so for those of you who know or don't know carpeted
921.09,936.6, is the centre of the condition of which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist and it leads to weakness to pain to micanopy and so here the idea that was that if we could map the pain profile of each patient
936.66,974.55, we could then affect and customs the gloves to this particular pathology the problem with the mobilized races in to day's industry is that because their mass produced their often too big too small to constraining in terms of movement and so is there a way to then at the specific pain profile by unfolding the skin literally of your wrist will not liberally but digitalin then re formulating this pain profile is a set of graduation of stiff and somites that would cater to hold and allow you to constrain the movement in a flexible way
976.32,990.84, so these are the gloves i tell of my bike yesterday and i'm a vivid by writer and so i'm waiting for my glove to be printed this is assumed in view the shouther molecule
991.02,1009.44, metaphorically in the glove again the question of dynamic range how do you define when component in the glove which we act to pain is very important and so the idea that when molecule equals one bit almost in terms of its behavioral capacity is very very important here
1009.8,1016.76, so this is your looking at the fortitude which will be displayed in a couple of days in the museum of science
1017.12,1044.0, similarly beast was a project to generate customable chalice which is made of when material is the printed and this material changes in thickness but it has a different material property it has a different mixtures and different compositions so it's sustains it holds itself structurally will at the same time an account for centisol pressure points of the user
1044.24,1046.07, to think of
1046.1,1061.58, you acupuncture or wearing your sage therapists to work and so these five materials change color the darker the stiffer the lighter the more softer there also silicon bumps that are attached to the skin of this chez
1062.87,1066.17, medical industry provides in how do we
1066.2,1085.76, instead of the using those ideas and importing them to products that are useful for us as humans how do we know we consider how we invent or technologies for construction so it was linton who said consider the momentous event in architecture when the wall parted and the column became
1086.12,1100.37, for me the wall and the column as for nature is one thing it's just a matter of how material redistributes itself to cater for those different conditions and so the idea was how to now take some of those ideas
1100.43,1102.62, get a new technology
1103.52,1121.55, that would cater for more sustainable way of making and doing things and so we know that if fifty percent of new commercial buildings were built with fifty per cent less energy we would be saving six matriculants of set for the life of buildings
1121.61,1124.4, we print buildings
1124.76,1127.37, they for worriting bones
1128.48,1131.24, we save that percent of material
1131.78,1153.47, yes so now new branniton of mine at the tedaidee ment of the new technology is called variable property printing and the idea of this technology is to allow one to mac those structural conditions and generate variation and propitiation and hostility to generate this
1153.65,1156.29, effort in material efficiency
1156.89,1158.84, we would be building
1159.23,1173.0, would be printing buildings as if we would be printing oysters a hundred a thousand times the scale we would have when material we would very scrope is and we can control soft and differentials pantalettes
1174.68,1184.22, i wanted to end on this one now commemorating the power of design to day i was thinking that whenever we
1184.37,1204.56, think of a momentous world problem or or a persistent threat that is posing to harm humanity today whether it's poverty whether its climate change whether it's the medical industry would ever solutions ingenious solutions are generated they have always
1204.56,1207.86, and will always consist of design
1208.28,1213.38, design is truly alive because it's truly truly relevant
1213.5,1217.76, we move in this moment of transition not in the
1217.94,1237.02, seeing and of change but in the sending and of change and his high time that we've transcended the fallen state of design from the sanctuary the dinosaur sanctity into a new and exciting paradigm of making literally making our future and it happening so think you
