3.03,34.59, a happy to say that difficult space
34.62,61.38, and places where people to meet face to face vital or car all of these places to matter and if there is the potential to change anaerobic space is one of the most often
61.47,66.81, used phrases and talking about cities today usually it refers to
66.9,69.12, outdoor space
69.33,102.66, there are no doors to that space it is free and accessible to everybody and nobody has to pay an admission fee to come in public space is a place for people come to be represented as part of the public as part of the group of people who have so reiterated how it's going to operate
102.66,110.22, treat themselves into fineless any space around you really should be public space except those
110.25,121.89, yes that is specifically in property but i kind of have trouble believing that land is private property and i think all space is public space and usually they're some kind of
122.91,127.86, between what was intended and went really happened
127.86,129.06, often
129.06,131.88, slip each becomes the impetus for the
132.06,152.01, generation of a new set of ideas about how part should be organized rises a reconsidered public and open to the public or in fact exclusion so the question is how have our definitions of who ought to be excluded from public space really change
152.37,186.03, a public often historically had the defined for example as white property owning men now that's changed drastically as struggles for inclusion by women by people of color by immigrants have transformed whom we take to be part of the public and so with those struggles there's been an opening up i think of public spacesuited what public space is
186.87,194.22, things that we forget its places that we take for granted as kind of you know originally public spaces like hark
194.49,214.98, demanded their right to be in that space and in fact in that case it was when working men who are fighting for an extension of the franchise to non property owning men were not allowed to meet any of the halls and so they pushed down the fences around the royal park and opened it up for public debate where the
215.01,236.73, as speakers corner is now and those kind of responses that kind of dialectic is i think what constructs public space as it actually is we still have the ideal of public space that was created in ancient athens and then ancient rome we think of the public space
236.82,240.0, as the physical area
240.03,248.58, the public's fear that is a place where people reasonably meet and mingle and talk about
248.88,256.89, if politics and the future of society so there is always the shadow of the political world
256.98,279.21, and the idea of public space park design has changed over the years since the eighteen sixties when the very idea of public park was born in the united states the first ideas of public park were to create spaces of nature
279.9,299.58, but those came in after things like court house square right or the old town commons where on particular occasions when there was a protest that had to be made more people got together right and met her design was intended to affect with behaviour in it and create appropriateness
300.15,333.45, park itself was constructed to provide a place where working people can learn to be proper americans learn to be proper citizens learn proper mode of behavior as a lot of the big part of the tenth century in the united states and there's a sense they are often gifts of the elite centerpole of what i call the pleasure ground in the early days when you don't want men spending their wages on alcohol the powers that be and to create an environment that would be
333.63,334.89, peering
335.04,344.76, to take his family with him to stroll in public if he sees himself as head of his family be less likely to spend their food money
345.81,351.45, a tavern
351.54,363.78, union square at first was pretty much a few patches of green space in the intersection of three really big streets
364.11,388.11, during the time that robert moses was in control of public park instruction in new york city in the the design for union square was changed to make more of a secluded space of nature in the middle of the city around union square you still had the three busy streets but
388.2,394.71, the park itself was inclosed by high stone walls and trees
394.98,409.47, white who was a journalist but became a kind of public anthropologist read the work of cane jacobs especially where jacob's talks about is on the street
409.5,416.25, there's a place that is dangerous binhart in the middle of new york
416.61,421.83, a green and spacious and the cops retaliates as well they should
422.07,426.18, ealdorman it their curator
426.45,429.42, been able to because it is cut off from the street
429.48,436.11, and a very pleasantly the shaded paths but you can get a feeling of entrapment in the
436.26,444.57, socialists a threat that he wouldn't elsewhere it might a place like this work you must unbent
445.68,458.94, so when his ideas were adopted by the new york city parks department they raised the money partly through the private organizations the bids that managed brian park and union square
459.54,462.06, they use this money to
462.09,470.07, hard down the stone walls and tear down the trees that had blocked the view of the park from the outside
476.22,488.37, the term social control didn't when it was invented didn't mean what it means to us to day is a sort of negative you know big brother manipulating thing
488.52,495.0, actually and groups collectively controlling themselves deciding what was appropriate
495.09,498.75, didn't want people being drunk or they didn't want
498.99,503.79, in the streets killing little kids so they now made the playground movement
505.05,507.78, to some degree we all determined
508.05,519.3, the kind of behavior that will be permitted in the public space because we all put our eyes on the space and by our own surveillance we
519.3,524.13, censure or we accept different kinds of
524.16,527.01, behavior different from ours
527.01,536.43, but number one activity is people looking at other people but it is appointed is overlooked in many many designs
536.94,538.62, the girl was
539.61,546.06, but disdainful sort of looking down their nose as though the girls weren't quite worthy of their talent
546.66,548.19, as
548.37,552.81, you have never ever seen a girl in her make a pass at the girl
554.25,558.69, don't feel free and public space if they think they're going to be mugged
558.69,580.56, so don't feel free or many people don't feel free if they think somebody sitting next to them going to bother them in some way the notion that eyes on the street will make undesirable school
580.89,582.3, one level is right
582.96,608.4, of course also problematic because who defines what constitutes undesirable what more right to i have to be in that place than a bunch of teens a color right or a homeless person who's just you know tired of ships to sit down a few of them who wanted to sit there and talk with each other with all their stuff expositors decisions made
608.49,639.18, often it's the police bittinger ment agencies like the parks department but increasingly the private business associations in the form of business improvement districts who control public spaces higher their own private security guards who are free to police the public spaces regarding programmer are often favored their usefulness seems to be largely symbolic my reassure management
639.33,640.83, don't see very much
641.31,643.83, let a human being
644.28,648.51, safe and successful places usually have a kind of rare
650.01,660.75, one of the best joe hardy of excellent is good at spottin potential trouble but what he likes best is helping people to girls for example who would like to have their petting
661.92,665.19, that's one reason why there isn't much trouble
666.96,669.27, since the late 
669.48,680.46, space especially public parks and commercial streets have been increasingly managed by private business associations which represent
680.55,689.19, the interests of commercial property owners building owners and also represent the interests of powerful institutions
689.25,690.75, in the neighborhood
691.38,693.03, for profit
693.03,697.71, interests organized in the form of a non profit
698.55,699.9, sociation
700.29,712.74, sometimes public parks are managed by similar organizations cold conservancy a little bit complicated but it's basically a private group managing a public space
712.98,744.42, ominousness improving district as a call claim that the coming in and making the area better what we say is that the talking the specific group of people to push them out they want a panair what then are should look like so you start to see if ventured allow a person to lay down and its obvious who the targeting in these areas people who don't have any other place to live and there designing of cities and i think that struggle
745.05,758.07, we were designed all our space so there are no room for these undesirable my where would they go if we wanted to be creative we can design efficient ways to help people live outdoors
758.7,760.62, we can provide them and pausing
761.79,765.69, we could do nothing is really poor policy
766.02,796.5, rules about not picking through the trash baskets which hampered the earning activities of homeless people there are rules about not setting foot on the grass at certain points there are rules about using the space during certain times now on the one hand all of these rules may make a space safer on the other hand they are rules that are decided on by a private association and imposed
797.76,816.69, what do petitions an interesting example of private management of public space
816.75,827.67, has got a huge amount of favorable publicity and indeed the two men who created the organization the friends of the high line
827.7,847.56, he received the twenty ten jane jacob's ward from the municipal art society for contributing greatly to the way we see new york city the high line is kind of a blue between the open space ideology where we'd like the city like looking at it
848.34,857.85, a new perspective on it by being raised up and walking through the buildings and in fact with that one place where you can sit and watch the average
858.03,860.19, fill
860.22,869.55, there's a sustainable component in the decision was made to keep the body the energy in the abated track rather than tearing it down it
869.67,870.9, in the
871.2,874.86, volunteers of the witan the plants that there into
877.56,882.54, he is one of the great stories has inspired many people to
882.57,890.37, norgate potential republic based to come out of anywhere
890.37,891.6, said
892.11,895.95, a little bit of it you know too much attention right now just of the
895.95,901.2, a very expensive parkinson have vidonati aspects or not
903.21,909.27, and these parts are not getting a lot of money for capital protecting a lot of money for security and many things
909.6,912.93, the buildings that are being built
912.93,924.21, around the high line are very expensive and an interesting question whether the high line would have been developed so fast and so far if it were located in
924.96,929.31, low income neighborhood let's say of the bronx or brooklyn
929.52,952.23, well in a way it's a commentary on the fact that municipal tax budget don't pay for parkman so users are taking over people who have business or live earthen
952.86,957.51, means only where there are resources will you ever get interesting
959.31,964.89, the whole advantage of using tax money is that you can even out
965.67,980.43, is it all neighborhoods ritual for it is absolutely a political reality that cities do not have the money to maintain parts to build new parks
980.58,1010.28, more than an economic reality it's politically is wrapped up in a long term assault on the public and anything that is public but we called by the shorthand of netherlands the argument doesn't go far enough it needs to start interrogating precisely why it is that a state can give great big tax break for a corporation to locate in a particular place but cannot pay for decent trash cans and a park
1010.94,1020.18, during the course of the twentieth century and in the first few years of the twenty first century
1020.63,1023.75, men and women have increasingly been shaped
1024.17,1035.84, the rules as consumers and we were so trained to consume our environment or inartificial evasion of it all through through the
1035.99,1045.92, shopping mall we are very sensitive to the kinds of spaces that appeal to our sensibilities as consumers 
1046.28,1082.88, he let us as attractive spaces where we won't be bothered where we will enjoy a few moments of leisure and where we will be able to buy a cup of coffee or a sandwich and graze for a while with other people like ourselves kind of like a shop and all with grass in the mill of the city i call this oneidas vision of urban civilization really shaped by consumer culture
1084.02,1138.62, a lot of americans think of the space around shopping malls as public space but in fact that space is privately owned and privately managed and the courts have always upheld private property owners rights over that space that often results in banning political activities demonstrations or even just wearing a shirt with a slogan the two dozen pro pop protesters marched into the rural today they were responding to a man stopped in the mall because he wore a yes we can abassides we get as on a poster no response by the arm but the same pro marijuana statement on a t shirt last week end he tried to say it was offensive conduct rules at the millbornes omers about non offensive a tire or wearing clothing that might lead to violence or conflict
1139.64,1173.72, same thing is also true on streets streets that are governed by business improvement districts it means that private agencies can engage in policing of streets precisely because the same kind of constitutional limits on the appointed somersetshire suspicion
1174.47,1179.24, that sense it were invited into a space now rather than we can be there as of right
1180.62,1211.04, example now a millennium park in chicago where there is not a square inch that is not sponsored by some corporation or foundation you can't sit on a bench out knowing that it's the chase bench of whatever whichever presents the principalia it's all of these kinds of things is less a public space in certainly less i publicly supported space than it is a private space that has been opened up for the public to use and a private
1212.06,1223.7, crinagoras represent a middle ground between curly public and surely cried
1223.91,1235.01, they are managed by the groups of put their work into the garden the park system it is run by the park commissioner and
1235.1,1279.56, employees the community gardens are managed by volunteers and maintained by volunteers gobernadorcillo i saw his great osteopathy were good notions you tritonomendetes morton
1279.59,1303.35, then to the where a lot of the social service groups the settlement houses at the time created programs to help immigrants and one of the things they would do is taking some open space and and allow the immigrants to create little many farms there in growth rather own vegetables and then when the first world war happened
1303.35,1313.4, they became victory gardens the so that we can send food over to a boys overseas and you know and also have food to eight here
1313.46,1318.65, and then probably willitts the modern wave if you will of community gardens
1318.71,1320.84, again in the late 
1320.87,1338.39, when there was there was mass exodus from the cities mostly of white folks that with fleeing that the sentries and abandoning you know ned swaths of land what happened then were the people that stuck around said
1338.42,1340.61, we're not going anywhere
1340.76,1346.22, you know this land is just sitting there you know doing nothing or for being an is
1346.58,1356.27, tetuan make something out of it and if you look at a map of new york city and that shows where all the community gardens are
1356.33,1368.18, and over that with all the low income neighborhoods are it'll almost beneath so the community gardens have actually become an an alternative
1369.68,1380.87, during the late is decided that the city government could no longer afford to keep all of the city owned property in its portfolio
1381.68,1389.27, and it would be beneficial to hold auctions to sell the property to real estate developers
1389.6,1392.96, there were many protests where
1393.14,1404.18, no working class middle class students environmental activists joined together to protest the sitting government efforts
1404.3,1412.79, sell their gardens they became spaces organization their community organizing but also citywide organizing
1412.97,1414.56, conflict
1414.77,1419.96, resulted in the demolition of some of the most beloved gardens
1420.53,1421.67, not all
1421.79,1424.7, mayor blomberg's compromise
1424.82,1427.91, many more community gardens would be saved
1428.33,1435.29, some would be bought and managed by non profit organizations and foundations
1435.86,1441.02, a few of them would be sold to developers to build housing
1441.74,1448.01, i think that it's the closest thing that we have so far to a community
1448.1,1449.18, ship
1450.47,1451.67, and
1452.51,1488.03, and he wore demonstrators protest us involvement in the vietnam war in mass marches rallies and demonstrations central park is the starting point for the bravo the unbuilding estimated one hundred twenty five thousand manhattanites inclosed students assidious iness men teachers priests and nuns the covenanters were bizarre
1488.24,1502.13, the supreme court at one point declared that engaging in public questions engaging in protest engaging in the bath with a primary use and had been from time immemorial for the streets of the city
1502.79,1531.68, they back pedaled very very quickly after that started finding that primary purpose of streets was to move goods and the move people from one place to another to transportation and commerce becomes far more important and our rights are trumped by the rights of commerce ideally if we go back to the image we have of the agora in ancient athens or the forum in ancient rome we should all be
1531.92,1536.72, citizens and creators in the largest sense in public space
1537.05,1539.42, but i'm not sure we
1539.42,1544.73, i'm not sure we really know how to be creators in public space
1545.24,1570.68, so those are the tramps what has to happen i think is a reversal of this transit open up spaces and a fight to regulate them in some ways to make them less controlled and fight to return them back to public ownership public control and really democratic
1571.1,1574.37, i guess in a way that it's truly public
1574.37,1577.16, space should be a place
1577.43,1578.57, for
1578.84,1580.04, the cities
1580.43,1596.48, and physical health polished be a place that we can go to we can hang out in we can relax we can play odelette and the neighborhood may be we'll get some of that real active involvement full you have an access
1596.63,1610.58, to green spaces we can buy in the line and do nothing to stuff to get to do the planting in the harvest in deciding when to replant marketstoke facilities
1610.61,1623.48, for everybody but i also like to make sure that they actually were for human interaction public space must be a place to live there have to be broad spaces where people gather together
1623.72,1626.09, say something is not right
1626.39,1633.56, have to be places where you can push for your political rights and just speak their minds
1633.62,1645.14, so that's really at the heart of why popes are so contentious precisely because they have to be so many different kinds of things public space has to
1645.17,1646.7, provide for
1646.97,1650.03, the needs of the population
1650.15,1651.86, this is a
1652.79,1654.53, major responsibility
1654.68,1661.31, he
1661.31,1667.01, that's another there might be more
1667.04,1680.03, he one
