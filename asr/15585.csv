0.33,22.08, i reciting maybe we should talk a little bit about the press itself and the problems of the press before we go forward i'm not going to sit here and tell you that were the greatest people on earth we've all made mistakes were human beings but i have dedicated my life and as everyone else here
22.68,25.59, trying to be a disinterested third party observer
25.65,33.93, the information is taken me i want to go get the information if my facts are wrong correct me if i make a mistake of correct it i have no
34.47,36.6, than that now agenda
36.84,65.46, opinion pages are different but news pages are not these pages are supposed to be feted information where news is disseminated the public as such all i have is the ability to go and ask some one to talk to me they can tell me to go to hell which happens on occasion and more likely than not people do want to talk and they'll talk to you some of the information you garner and gather is not information that they want any one ostentat they're connected to and they asked for protection and we give it
66.24,67.59, not always
67.83,69.06, not easily
69.69,71.58, a hard choice to make
71.91,73.98, the consequences or even harder
74.22,87.51, and when we all got together to night i said this is kind of like my family i feel like we're all family because we've all gone through this as my friend john was said this is a small club
87.54,109.26, as to be a member and we really don't want any more members i want a national shield low if there's something that comes out of the evening i hope we all can agree that reporters need to be protected and the information needs to be gathered in disseminated we do cover too much just in beaver too much madonna
109.71,124.83, too much cartesian and i don't care it's it's nice on the entertainment page but it shouldn't dominate coverage the problem is when you take away our ability to gather information what are you going to have left
125.19,127.26, there left to disseminate
127.65,140.31, but that type of information the let me tell you there's doesn't stop you can turn on the television at a point in time and there's going to be something on that news or parading his news or you can get on the internet
140.85,143.7, and you can find facts that are not betted
143.97,150.57, he can find sooin alec tual garbage parading his information from a suasit that isn't news
150.87,152.58, you tell the difference
152.88,160.08, right now more than any other time in our history we really do need good solid news gathering
160.77,173.22, we need the government back off and let us do our job ever get for 
173.22,174.45, after
174.66,196.68, while we be missed me absolutely protest again if this pilatre last time during the protest there were inventions were arrested and detained sequestration ministration with his administration at least support reporters and trying to do their job and gathering facts
196.74,249.33, i got over had to iterate and then numbered two new congressman gingras in out of maryland is proposing said he will sponsor legislation for a national shield low your vice president and pass his supported a national shawemere with this imitation support a national sheaffe reporters i have not asked it to great question i'd be glad follow with you that is president watching the agitating to bring us together in the consternation his the ones own party the usurper how is this present going to address the fact that people are looking to bring people together in any with his own words seems to be driving a part and that a very one sided way of looking at this i think he's brought there
249.57,310.98, said and done more importantly to start to bring this country together and his policies frankly are focused on keeping every american safe we take the congressman the portiere getting these mail saying you going to repeal replace bamacharee wonder body would congress and senators get into dress that since congress drawn if you remember pride tobacco the open market and from a variety of different options and tailor what you or your family denatured up with macaroni the rest of us can you addresses i think that's why we're trying to pass it the way we are we want more choice we want more concoction we want lower cost saying that you open it up because of uncontroversial cost of not having a job
311.46,335.67, some communities coal mine forestry are the only job in to the point and return the land to its original christine i was taught long that we knew we knew levantine in the same or better condition you found it a looking over saint very many there categories this amonition actively attempting to reach out to the other side of the aisle
335.67,368.73, the dialogue that exists between this administration in this presidents and governors i think is a very refreshing forward altogether
368.79,371.1, and people who
371.82,389.01, describe to pushing fake stories is where his target was what is it opposer but not otasite refugees antennae two was the reaction this administration's reaction to russia saying we are running a danger of a real war with the middle east
389.01,390.78, with respect to 
390.9,406.83, one the reason that we took action with multifold number one stop the proliferation in the recurrence of chemical weapons when you see mass weapons of destruction being used it should be a concern to every nation especially our own people the proliferation of the
408.45,413.4, suppose a grave secure threat to our national security
413.4,422.67, so number one we have to stop that number two we have to stop basis but with respect to the people of syria by us taking action
423.27,442.44, eating was going on in syria that's the greatest thing you can do to support those people butentrot i mean there what it means to think this president has made it very clear that if those actions were to continue further action will definitely be considered by the united states we continued to urge
442.86,451.53, further the world community to join us in a coalition did we have a call i mean again i think if you look at whose not with us
451.53,512.04, it's a pretty small group of quasi missis best available science as a matter serious overreach you don't want to but a dissenting search and never to what other issues do you like to see the president reach out to democrats to coniston the first one that science is best science and that whatever is right well if it's not available is tough to use it just as attributing its odor it's got to be available that it plainly should read anything into that last weissenstein bread this threat if he can't go through with it so what change what's our goal and north korea was the strategy and what your response to the critics and say that this is just blueworthy some of the problems on the white house staff and soothe feelings domestic socialist
512.28,513.51, would not
513.93,537.33, believe that north korea is actions are both provocative and the concern so the actions that were taking or extremely that it was their propriate justified what we're doing is working with the world community and as i've mentioned multiple times today especially china which is really acting in a historic way to ensure
537.66,589.65, the forester is what about the criticism from people on the hill say you're just hiding it at domestic agenda that is a work i i don't i've never heard the vendetta criticism should which travel different stores as any one from the department of justice identification with any one in montgomery county or roasted cried themselves a sanctuary county and city and there's also plodder government at montgomery consolatorily is talking about a state law to make the state a sanctuary state are the governors of pose to that glad to hear that would be such a mistake a local version of it to shade the grey hat the white house crossfire which shone spicer there said instead of christian histologist and gray
589.95,602.01, up came in we decided to send all that what's going on down there has a huge effect on us locally maybe more so than in the recent past so i assigned one of our
602.07,620.52, colonists and myself the cover congress the senate and white house on a regular basis to see what we can find out of there that of interest a local readers we've had numerous emails numerous requests numerous questions and so what we decided to do was to take our time to try and
621.54,638.19, separate the wheat from the chaff so to speak and i found that there's a lot of wheat and a lot of chaff and it's an ongoing process and trying to figure out exactly what the truth and the fact was this white house because some people accusing anti science there is every reason to believe that there is
638.37,648.18, a large number of people in that white house whether it is the president himself i do not know who seemed to take issue with
648.48,719.55, not specifically with climate change because of their association with fossil fuels here so it's driven by economy yes and then science in general because it helps themselves sage the climate change is questionable so it's kind of two proncho whether or not they honestly believe that i cannot tell you because i don't know so we land or talking to sir the big thing here locally is of course what happened in congress who was a sit in with members of aronson delegation joining others democrats in to try and get some changes made to the unwholesomeness
719.7,732.09, to do all over the place well terials threaten i mean that's when they get you to change your lifestyle than they in successful and terrorizing you there's a lot of fear i got a lot of mails
732.09,734.43, and the fair can overcome 
734.43,738.09, this term limit
738.69,762.15, i'll be on the ballot two of them yes two of them i think turmits are ridiculous i think it discourages people from becoming involved if you want to get involved getting romantic all this effort into bringing this to fruition and it would be nice if people actually in the county got that involved in running for office and other voices were heard that's the another limits
762.15,764.22, o for the president of the united states
764.52,774.0, says turligood for sedition in i don't necessarily think it is i think the bottom line i don't think terminates work
774.51,794.28, a number of reasons one if the guys doing a good job and not keep them around why shouldn't you do you really want to i mean take a look at this year's presidential campaign the really like the specter adding donald trump in or would you prefer to i mean a lot of people would have voted for a third term for bamacharee people would have voted for a third term for bill clinton
794.31,820.38, and in congress the big problem is if you limit people to terms the one happens as you have a professional staff that you're not is not responsible to the electorate who then has all the power and that's not a good thing somewhat in which to to kenyon people interested in an affecting the thinking people come interested i think it's the political debate which turns them off
820.44,828.72, filled with vitriol hatred and wat and i was joking earlier but the fact that you have three different groups coming together
828.87,866.04, benefiting and taking community first instead of party instead of self interest young people are more responsible and responsive to that plea but when two republicans or democrats iteration to put up there the way a journalist is going to remain at his is going to remain relevant is being a disinterested third party observer and so i'm not going to you know my opinion you'll know it it's labeled in opinion if you read an editorial in the sentinel it says that it oribi we pretend it's fact we're not pretending it's fact the appearance versus reality you decide what the facts may bee freedom of information
866.07,889.77, in going on there is no transparency everyone here put it on the line to gather information for the press to disseminate to the public and i hope if nothing else we will serve by being here to day the first step in a nishiation shield law and serve as an example for young reporters what you should do every one up here said
889.89,892.5, when they were you know first arrested
892.8,903.72, face the prosecution may all told to say we believe in the first amendment just not in your case and some of us had to face the prospect of other brother in the press
903.72,913.53, thinking that we did this for private gain and had to listen to some one tell me that the reason why i went to jail was to further mark career and i sat there
913.65,934.44, thinking if this is where my career is going i don't know if i want to be a reporter everyone here has made a sacrifice equal or greater i'm proud of to be a member of the crew
