84.75,88.47, i think that there is an appreciation for this type of work in fact 
88.89,91.14, the agenda
91.17,94.23, a process could have been done the same way
94.56,95.58, years ago

143.73,149.4, designing a it is done things change during the process prince
149.64,150.72, sometimes
154.02,157.92, some traces i enjoy that process
158.07,160.74, don't know what the intentions going
163.23,169.41, the most valuable things that in school was to turn off this little voice in her head
170.34,175.29, that's my dear don't do that like a star in a painting that in all this
175.8,178.59, i got to this boasted
180.12,181.17, it
182.79,184.32, to focus on
184.41,185.88, a quality
186.03,189.42, a bunch of drawing a whole lot of work
189.54,190.23, the
190.29,191.07, after
193.53,196.83, i try to evaluate sort of approach
197.22,199.05, translated well to
199.05,200.58, bad ideas
200.64,203.67, seeing them through to the point where there

204.81,233.97, the additional size is influenced by what the print is the making most of our projects and about three hundred prince a large normal print run for us is a thousand that kind of project comes at once her ridicules and doing a larger run like that after doin just physical constraint of working a ship the size all our papers are made from old paper by the french paper company
236.19,263.76, american is against the nice people a hundred and thirty year old family one company in the sixth generation papermakers thunder per cent recycled stock as it creamed using hydropores elgood galusha paper were a forest inescation to make posters to melviney the medusa want that but i'm not going to do it for
264.9,275.76, the next threat to this process would be if one of our screen printing materials may factor such as the company you latif they were to go out of business
275.76,277.29, so making rubila
