2.19,45.57, everybody this is arouse a film today we have another instalment of our undoing series about adobes six this video has to do with using a obedient coder to export different file formats from sequences or from video cliffs right now i'm in premiere and there's two real ways to use it to immediate or you either tragic into me anoder or you can export a sequence when she the first way of using me and color that is exporting a sequence out of prepossession on the cancer we did so what i'm going to do is to file
45.75,60.36, export media and that's one open up some export settings now in the expert saying we have our source can our output the appetite the files going to export as
60.45,89.22, i will have some source scaling were going to scale that to fit the frame and down here we have the time code as you see in that line up with the time code on the sequence and if you remember from the interface video on adobe this is not as the work area bar the idea little one here so you can export certain sections of the video of need be but we want to export the entire sequence
89.43,109.71, now over here on the right we have the export settings now you can simply just export you sequence and mass the sequence settings but you got to make sure your sequence is set up perfectly from the start well we're going to do is we're going to export a progress using a doyenne
109.74,116.22, so far format is quick time but we get our given a lot of choices we're going to see quick time
116.46,122.4, and the priest have all these apple progress presents were going to choose apple progress
122.46,132.45, four to two eight i'm shooting eighteen eighty twenty three point nights of six french perfection because if you look down here in the summer
132.45,179.91, are source the sequence is a t p twenty three point nine seven six frame per second sequence you can always choose another if you want to change the frame rat or the frame size but we'll get into that in the second i'll put name if you click on that you can rename the output as well as save it to a specific location such as forestall that porter output great that folder and with this call that instructional progress and that changes that were to check boxes even export only the video can export only the audio or doing both together we're going to do in both and if we go down here to the export setting tabs
180.0,200.82, a number of options to go through filters i never used this because plies a filter to your entire sequence and i don't really like to do that if i can't see it so i'm going to bypass that going to the video table have several options video coda apple provisor to two as you see with the priest said
201.21,290.73, we have a lot of this already filled in but we can still make some changes to it the video coasts where we want it gives us options for coasting and you'll see has a game correction said to automatic and said that the non you'll notice that in the export of its own it won't look exactly like the sequence informer created down basically sayings quality of a hundred cents and frame size nineteen twenty by ten eight that's exactly where we want twenty three point nine seven six francs per second square passes all part of the progress prestige down here to render at maximum depth that's an option right there what is render a maximum depth will render it maximum depth increases the colored depth that your video is working with and rendering to if you're simply working with video that has very low color depths like desolating it color space you won't really need to tabitha because it won't really matter and i'll desines orosin time however if you're working with ographies some high contrast values or color gradients you probably want to enable this option because you you can introduce banding into it if you're changing the code space and then you have two options for death twenty four bed for a bit the more you increase your bit depth the more colors you will have to work with rearmament to be confused with maximum render quality
290.79,300.63, i render quality does is it aids in the scaling and reversion process only you don't need to enable maximum render quality unless you're exporting
300.87,355.95, in a format or a pic ratio that's different from your original video for example if you're rendering candidate time line out to a fop file format you're going to want to use maximum render quality to insure the best sailing with the least amount of artifacts and alice if you're exporting at the same size and cook that you've been working with don't bother checking this it'll just cost you time and processing power and its only function is to do high quality residing of your work if we go over to the audio tab we have some more options some going to keep that uncompressed you can change the sample raid and the depth of your audience reviews ashatea's going to use the renders we've already been using in the sequence while we were editing and it's going to speed up the uncoding time otherwise if that's uncheckered everything anew
356.16,365.16, i want to catch you as framed lending us this if you're going to convert to a different frame rate as it's going to blend the frame together and sort of dropping them
365.16,368.37, we have all our settings good
368.49,446.82, two options we can just export it immediately with its current settings that's one way to do it but what i'd like to do is cuthbert for several reasons one when you press que it appears the data for export and opens up a obedient code and with that does is it freeze you up to continue working and premier pro while that renders the other reason is because medicines you the option to export several different file formats at the same time so i'll show you how to do that but let me introduce you to a doebereiner main boxes the cue the precept browser the watch holder on going to get into that in a little while and the uncoding window we licence is exported all the data for the sequence and all our customs settings for the export now if you don't want to go from premier to meander if you want to just bring a video into media coder you just would add as a new source and pick a video and just transpose directly from the meeting coat canceled but the other thing we do is likenesses source
447.15,457.41, that we just exported to an opening code and we can add output which means we can add a completely different file format to export
457.71,468.3, from this source so since we're exporting a program very and when we also make a virgin for online play back every for classroom play back at us
468.33,485.04, we add an output and gives us the same options we want to go on venerate have to export to anton if you go to the press it already has at the very bottom presents for vineland tube
485.82,488.28, so i'm goin to lick one of those
488.52,505.53, and discontents are presents of doves made that corresponded with the guide lines of eneas for uploading you might well use his precept because of amy's going to reencounter file anyway but with much less scrutiny
505.71,521.37, so if we click on it we can just change a few things at all that seems great i want to render it maximum depth and use maximum rendered body because we're doubting the sequence so much to a five minute per second
522.51,553.29, i want to try to retain as a much quality as possible so i went click both those and since we're exporting from sequence will use epeius to pass emily goes up to five magination arimanes that there it's made another output let's do one more for classroom playback or blew a players play eight states four and i'm going to go down to
554.52,586.53, h p twenty three point nine seven six franc per second if he click on that we can change a few of the settings this is all fine a promise or foray players won't play anything back higher than thirty maarten so i went kitchenmaid rate to third magister second and and i always like to do it two past a two pasos through the video again and really refined the quality of the income
587.52,588.39, he
588.54,604.17, and since we're not down grading the quality that much is still blue red quality of this eight worded you don't have to worry about examiner quality or rendering it next month death but as the disgusting now you can always do it
604.44,605.67, up to you
605.79,622.05, now these are presents that dominates so what about a priest that we make less one go over to the precept rouser and create a new precept let's say you really like the settings on the progress
622.05,642.84, master file that we just made and you want to make that a present because you're going to be using it over again what will do is make a brand new priest and call digester file then we'll just find a established free set to base it off of all progress and then effect the setting just like we did for the progress araound good
642.93,644.61, digital material
644.73,647.67, use prestat we just created
647.79,653.07, and we can even add under quick time did you master file
653.19,681.33, there that's a present we just created and it'll be safe forever on your computer or if you don't like it you can always disbelieve so now that we have all these outputs onion him and rename classroom one save all right and what we're going to do is to peer to start you
681.87,716.43, and as you'll see it's reading the camp information from the sequence getting all the cuts and information about them in order and it's going to output all three for mats at the same time made as put a stop to that real war last thing i want to show you and to be meeting other is something very special and it's called the watch for now the withholder is a digital act managers agree what you can do
716.88,739.59, is out of order but say we want to you and create a new order will call it fate do perishes with these you can uncode an entire folder worth of files into one or more formats let's say we want to progress
739.92,745.83, say we want to do a progress a tame and a classroom playback
746.37,807.84, wonderful is and we can even assign these different outputs so we can just make a new order in that to where all the progress will and that's where all the time files will go that's where i'll classroom play back will go and he follow put in that folder will export all those formats and to all those outports a new video file we put in that folder will export to those separate folders as you see and that's it that's using adobe median code and advises has been zapote equipment room have a great day
