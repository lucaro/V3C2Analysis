5.7,16.8, my name's christian on the editor in chief of lucky peach magazine i want to give you guys a little bit of an opiate on something we talked about last year
17.01,19.47, last year i was left on the stage
19.77,21.69, crackpot scheme
21.96,27.75, what is mad is not a place for crazy idiots of crackpot schemes to present the ideas
27.84,36.6, and that idea was something that my friend peter and i had come up with that we wanted to undermine a notion that's been spreading throughout the restaurant world that
36.69,41.73, that eating at restaurants that cooking at restaurants that being someone who works at a restaurant
41.79,42.81, i
42.87,51.09, intrinsically bad for the environment so assumed in on one aspect may be the most important aspect of the environment climate change
51.15,56.34, examine two restaurants we examined promethean brooklyn
56.37,64.95, run by frank fallen frank open and we examined no man
64.95,72.99, and we may these guys open up their prisoners as to us made us made them show us what it takes to put a meal on the table
73.23,80.16, and determine exactly the effect of these restaurants had global warming on climate change and
80.58,84.48, i came away with a conclusion i came away with more than anything after this study
85.23,87.45, the outlook is not so dire
87.78,89.85, that with a little bit of effort
90.09,95.46, can not only be fine to eat a fine for the environment but can be leaders
95.61,99.84, the world they can leave the way for environmental change for environmental stewardship
99.84,101.79, no my demonstrate that immediately
102.24,110.22, he told renner crime that we had found that a majority of the power and no macumer coal power power plants
110.46,118.53, they sent a couple of miles they made a few phone calls and they changed to a sustainable energy source and reduced their carbon missions by thirty per cent
118.56,119.46, instantly
120.48,122.1, as good
122.16,132.48, percent is enough to inspire me and a couple of other guys to start a non profit called zero food print the idea being that we will take restaurants beginning with a small group
133.44,141.69, to open themselves up in the same way that i meet and no to show us how their business are run how their food is cooked where the delivery come from
142.14,145.29, take one step further and commit to having
145.29,148.41, no carbon footprint to being completely carbon neutral
148.68,154.74, and so i know of these terms in going around a kind of abstract the idea of climate change in global warming as a kind of abstract thing
154.77,156.78, an you're sitting in a room
157.32,162.42, this one word so fucking hot to notice one degree up or down
162.57,165.54, we know that one ever down can make all the difference in the world
165.87,178.14, and when i say things like offsets i know that it seems like an abstract idea that like something somewhere away over there can effect how your restaurant is run and how your restaurant can affect the environment but i'll give you one concrete example
178.92,185.31, the more rural parts of africa a lot of the cooking is still done over open fires that are burned in doors
186.0,195.3, these fires contribute to climate change pollute the air but they're also significant health risk the people who were living inside cooking smoke everywhere
195.3,197.07, breathing this in
197.31,198.72, one way
198.81,203.01, well offset carbon missions created by a restaurant
203.16,207.39, replace those open fires with clean burning natural gas cook stoves
207.51,211.35, so not only will
211.38,216.45, some persons not only will
216.9,218.79, clean the air
219.36,222.21, remove that health risk of these people
224.13,230.28, improve the quality of the air and the quality of life these people and so the first two restaurants obviously
230.34,232.71, part of this zero food print group
233.01,235.5, or no and prime it
235.5,242.7, or i'm sorry not finite france new restaurant which i am announcing for them coming some
242.79,247.41, leave only for that clearly
248.19,253.17, beginning this year beginning now beginning today with all the sitting here
253.26,256.95, no mobile no longer contribute to climate change
257.16,260.64, from day one of the franks nerestan neither will the
261.09,274.83, notices and topics that we talk about it a mad or important to all of us what is cooking 
275.04,285.54, these are things that we care about but to be totally honest the reason why we come here over and over again the copenhagen is because we look up to the chefs that speak on the stage and we look up to the ones that organize this
285.87,287.76, and i really believe
288.09,291.84, if the rents and franks and daves and alexis
293.88,296.31, the torch and light the way for us
296.64,298.14, i will follow
298.14,303.63, and so that's my sincere hope for zero footprint that we can
304.05,311.16, follow very
