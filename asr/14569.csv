0.45,12.03, the patio mostly come from the native land the leaves in water the moody
14.19,47.07, as i kin friziling that i saw was the transition in built in the yard is this time bird is open space there was really an element that is baleinier the anses architectural and architecture of its group the couldst me the very much related an artist from another discipline brings a completely new perspective they see are our only septimine through very fresh eyes that can lead to some really interesting discoveries
48.57,51.42, the idea of course to have an architect
51.42,61.98, at for it all started when bananas philip johnson in the seventies to do a scenic design for all the valleys that were in that season
62.01,68.01, so i thought when you be nice to revisit that notion with her architect of to day
68.07,81.87, so i did a little research and calatrava was the one that popped in the forefront of my mind while these works or when the futurist petermann ride me and tell me if i will be in the estimates something like that when
82.38,99.45, i mean when i came out of macbride you know i understood what a wonderful opportunity be suthin this office sharing ideas and he would take out his little panama make some drawings and then if he didn't have anything to sort of filling coloring
99.48,107.61, a very expensive biscuit and my astringent his finger with the red wine
107.7,110.49, it was fur i used that as a log
112.14,117.81, always been at that you see in a music as the highest art
117.99,119.79, because they happen
120.0,121.5, touched him
121.83,139.38, like i said one to work in in a box germanicus a box to look at it is a series indicating to the frame is the whole theatre
139.5,182.79, you have the void in the center of this to put an object there was i think finally the key of this solution may bring i propose even families even servitude so that the artisan find more andante it save heartwell that was all the way across a stage in the back with an entrance there will be twisted so thessalian behind it and behind it and comfortably people think you see the lines will extend and one direction or the other so you get also interfering touch you can see in my fingers you see the land put one over the other they create some prepositions
183.75,202.44, there's definitely moments where i just use shoes my orography and you might see it minot maybe there's no room for abandoned that the biggest surprise to me was seeing how mister calatrava was willing to listen to these cooperate revision and then adapting trying to accommodate them
202.5,216.87, he said to me he's not a collaborator an architect his eyes but he wants to design they was momenti which an act is will comment well i would like you know the way to its abstract ten tocano but i would like to have something out with the ever like to have found
216.87,220.11, of course you get choked in to say well why not powers
220.32,241.08, i went to contact and and i started painting pouts so it was a beautiful experience you know very interactive she just came up with these ideas and now there are paintings and sculptures and each cocopas is her own version instead of solid this will be bananas a beautiful pattern
241.32,267.84, my own version is the sculpture that is hanging from the ceiling that was suspended that sort of change was formation somebody come through some can enter there i had envisioned it moving at certain times so i'm careering the architectural changes in the valley the big insatiate a pantograph for the movement
268.02,272.58, as the pantograph opened the smaller disks
272.7,281.16, out to the side some of them rise or fall as their coming out we can't make a pantograph that large and make it work
281.16,324.27, so we adapted that design idea and engineered it with a set of motorized tracks which make the disappear to do exactly the same thing that the model does but does it with a slightly different engineering of course had some had to build it the broad to the theatre we flew up the trust that includes all the tracks and motors we hung the disks from that trust with few the whole thing up and we watched it work
329.46,342.18, the large pieces that have to be able to come down roll away and another set go up in the twenty minutes we have between ballets during the intermission while the audience having a drink
342.33,356.97, taking ideas from man doesn't normally think an inclosed terms and adapting them and trying to be as true to them as possible and yet bring them into our state space best been a great challenge
357.24,372.18, i was delighted i have to admit when the first time he saw the discs move he applauded and was very happy that was a relief to us because of course we wanted to make this into something that he felt reflected his design well
372.72,379.32, i like nationality is away i see them you know from the sketch the unpapered
379.35,386.49, and also the risking of a value in the coming out of the process
387.57,398.4, work is the life blood of the new york city pale twas always but this company was about to have great paperwork in this theater whether that composers are architects of andover excited
398.7,402.21, i hope very much in fact until
402.33,404.7, they are bringing the key
404.73,406.32, bringing the car
406.47,407.88, bringing the life
419.28,429.96, i
