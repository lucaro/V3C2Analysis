729.39,744.36, i have been in design verstanden almost thirty years well it's great so now you're a lovin invest project the palms project came to us a little better to the project waits what you're doing and what parthenope behind
744.42,749.1, yes this is why we hear well yet was
749.43,782.94, in los angeles a great opportunity for us we've been attending well through several years to research assembly systems materials were on project they approached us and said we like to present you project so be as it presented different aim the project of this interferometer the architecture interior landscape is in lighting systems and we've got a team semaines

813.21,816.54, she tannemann was well
816.84,827.19, your building is going to be a bedlamite house for interest know what exactly does that mean 
827.4,838.32, what kind of technologies and things are going to it to make it well or clients as strives brian cranstead to our tea with beginning
838.62,842.13, at the highest level of green building we can see
842.61,845.94, it smart but i want to get there
846.27,856.41, we responded we said well that's platinum the united states passive house you ask if you want to be a crazy you can start european more
856.77,865.95, we're approaching both flattened us passions so we are one of her not sure his unquiet
866.04,886.89, think about or so homes in the common mental us that would achieve this as a nation than the only one that i know of is in the region heretofore so there is the interest behind that again to plan an leave you need a lot of lead points you need
886.95,905.07, a lot of lead as improved providers in their discipline to her project and make sure you are meeting these requirements for lead papistic tion and their stringent and it cost little tads little more to the project to acrobat ten to fifteen thousand
905.22,917.37, edoocation so the owner has to be willing that to be knowledgeable and on board and there were fast epoch in the highest level green building for residential design
917.61,932.25, a favorite part in the house that reeling a caveat and also what are some of the difficult things to regeneration was in some of the rocks are well yes 
932.88,937.14, some of the best things about it are of course the passive systems
937.17,941.4, as house we don't rely on
941.55,949.29, mechanics or engineering but we rely on the sun and the wind in nature
949.38,960.87, the beginning of brindisi for me and certainly for this house begins with mature i spend time on the side track the solar course of the sun in the sky
960.9,1000.44, we look for the prevailing wind we like the landscape features and what my block in what were trying to do and then we had unified a building type in design with fenestration and persecution is going to take completement of the natural environment of the sight that's the beginning if you do nothing else grinestone centuries old principles in practical building which is to work with the sun and the wind hellebergene overbore that all the systems the photo botheration
1000.5,1030.71, which is a sixteen hour were set to be a natural house which means will be putting energy abusing lasting putting what we at present we make over back into the energy greenwood creatae heating for solomon for the radiant floor heating system and other awe got rainwater reclamation and six hundred allencaster beneath the ashenton
1030.74,1107.9, then the county were working with can't have great water reclamation and not varied in believe it but there allowing the trains so these are some of the big systems we put in to it a little thing too will not so little the ships walls the structurally insulted analysis but are very high art are valued for the home of his time and the insulation esdaile that blows in on a water base medium between the studs and the walls the heretics the house from leakage the mouth and prevents mould and mildew from collecting moist legares within the wall scatterer important the marine environment which is what his absinthe as irrational
1108.26,1118.85, i'll give you a list of recommendations to make their home but were fishing or that we can all do beyond that no construction and there get into assembly assistance and technologies
1119.99,1135.29, in earlier about those constrains you are working with constraint and trying to solve problems there days like making a decision with those constrains and mine and we're talking about making it attainable efficient durable and
1135.35,1142.58, all everything related to like getting approval for certain things to my question is
1142.61,1144.47, what type of constrain
1144.47,1148.55, drive the decision process and herald the most
1151.76,1160.76, for us the marine environment was the biggest challenge in the side from the county and the permitting and all that he expected in normal construction project
1161.24,1165.68, very harsh environment southeast on the surface materials
1165.83,1176.87, water especially salt water is the enemy of architecture and its constantly assaulted the medals that finishes the surface material inside out
1177.14,1183.59, from the beginning we start researching and providing materials that are going to do the best in the moneron
1183.74,1189.35, this is a key component sustainable design you're not feeling a land full
1189.89,1195.44, metals and lesser products that are only going to last years
1195.44,1197.66, using products like titania
1197.75,1200.15, that add a little to the initial cost
1200.18,1202.4, then we reduced the gauge of
1202.73,1209.33, in the thick agustin gage of the material and then it's almost equal to marine grade stainless
1209.36,1220.28, the environment is the challenge that has the biggest challenge a building to that range and you also talked about building the house
1220.34,1224.45, armorel about how the house needs to be
1224.45,1231.05, not reflect a current fad or one nation tread at what
1231.38,1238.58, favorite your favorite decision they have to make attaineth you make it durable and that sense of sapor
1238.64,1241.61, because you know in my work and
1242.09,1243.35, my colleagues
1244.25,1251.63, follow trampas it's nice to see what in colors and coming out in the lane green and the orange and the blue
1252.29,1257.09, when you get to be my age i think back to a harvest gold
1257.6,1261.92, analecta green unfortnet
1262.28,1269.06, compared house at one you're talking about architectural backgrounds and serve as materials
1269.6,1280.76, philosophy is to remain italy it and do things that are proven a classic that are going to remain analogo back to that home in sixteen twenty years
1281.63,1284.3, be a man even still be attacked 
1284.3,1288.71, master remote house designed sixteen years ago in ohio
1289.16,1358.43, the buyers found my name in a drawer in the kitchen called sixteen years later we turned the house together the cabinets were still there the flooring still there the plumbing pictures are still there the poles are still there the doors the windows were in the doomed you know the refurnishing and add a wing to the house and the minute petal the cabinet sinks fosses and hardware from the alemagna design sixteen years ago that makes me feel as if but that my job enabling things from land till by creating this sort of timeless and unscrutinised neutral a modern designs that argentan the testification
1358.58,1370.58, the choice and ye fashion you educate require that goes both ways we learn from the clientele were to die to do systems and sources because they saw something
1370.58,1381.56, they take a ladino a studied view of the project and open your eyes to something retires and he said well that you can do that maybe we can do that
1381.59,1436.76, so there's that exchange but the responsibility of the designer is to make sustainable choices for the project for the clean that's where our power lies in showing them some of these systems and products in the trials that a renegade he sustained in their manufacture and last in the durability of anshan you for the normand will look a ferito see the house finished well you know at both three palms project cometh the project of this head and the linter thing in all of our parties it's been fun for me to see the project of all and i hope you will tooanoowee sure but we talking to the editors of looks like the meetings was an thank you for althotas
1436.76,1439.88, that was our tour on wellington
1439.94,1452.75, was your favorite thing from here for me it was really cool to be able to go in some of the pronominal at it and get an idea of what that's like
1452.96,1461.51, most part there a lot smaller than average home in the us at least what some would be expecting
1461.57,1465.5, but with a smaller living space are learning to be more efficient
1465.59,1468.38, and so space as fast as possible
1468.59,1483.29, and for me that concept is something that's really interesting and i can see how a designer can have a lot of fun with that right and being able to make sure that all the space is being used in the best way and i also will like what resource was doing
1483.68,1486.83, the fall out beds and change your bow
1487.13,1488.99, especially
1489.2,1503.06, because of that point yes yes right well when to resources from insurance in one they're doing is there playing with ideal quality functional and furniture and designing furniture and i think that's
1503.09,1504.17, that's
1504.35,1514.25, and that is our aroint a doctor who armorica you cannot for you cannot afford to buy one of detention thing any more
1514.25,1516.02, i need to
1516.05,1534.59, think about the colonel martin is in every other way yes my favorite thing here is arthur humanity it's an unproportioned i like the metacentre to take initiative
1534.59,1536.51, and say that
1536.6,1541.73, esther empowers designers in the first place to
1541.73,1547.88, and out come up with solutions like insult of problems 
1548.0,1557.03, including property education and i think that what they're doing is great and i think it's the right time to do that
1558.5,1565.43, we're all here was awesome comment to beat and that's been made thick it out for mine
1566.24,1578.75, if you want to get in touch with us and we were you are who you would want to see inordinately as handbills
