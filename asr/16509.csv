10.38,14.22, there was a time when men wouldn't leave the house
14.22,16.02, without a hat
16.35,78.78, the odor became kind of the most popular hattie it was all federation nineteen fifty three nineteen sixty two in the head it was dead the big story is that jake didn't wear his top hat to the inauguration ball and that's when the hat died rosewater is on whether or not that accurate but it is a part of the story my reason but i like to think is that immediate sixties and seventies people really started rebelling against what their parents were doing they didn't want to look like their father the business attire i think that's finally coming full circle where my generation now is rebelling against the casual look of their parents than most of the heat that we see in the market are in impersonation of a hat like they give you the sense that you wearing a hat
78.99,82.71, all of the functional qualities that had originally
82.71,84.12, are there
84.51,92.88, he
92.91,102.93, so the store was opened in nineteen eighteen and it was that called shopwork
102.96,118.38, a man named napoleon chose he went by paul i believe to americanize himself he did not name the hatch up after himself in nineteen fifty his god son kelly bawlings changed the name to paul's hat works
118.62,132.0, and moved it to this location now and the seven days kelly apprentice several mananan picked the worthiest one as for tradition which was michael harris
132.09,158.25, and then i myself three other women but the hatch up from liaison of people are interested in the shop as you can imagine taking the hat boxes and sending them over to london or other matters in the east coast wanting the blocks and so this place was going to be pieced out he was looking for some one that wanted to continue the legacy of pulsators
158.25,178.11, he told me and he has been trying to sell the business for two years and i told him i went by it from him with the people olivia called us and said he i have something that's going to change our life before us came back the next day and sort of fell in love
178.47,185.85, saw an opportunity here but also saw that no one else was going to take it and if we didn't take it this place is going to die
186.15,233.64, and you stay with me a faint asleep like canopied a conclusion but the man was copernican because of the history but we we kind of had a figure out how to make it our own everybody that owned paul's hat works has been called paul kelly was called paul michael was calling with called paul so we all go by paul in its kind of funny palakin of like this other entity it like this palestrina in
235.59,246.9, when you put the right up on the right person there's a harmonizing effect it kind of extend your personality an extra in short and suddenly a person seasoned
247.02,264.27, completely differently all of a sudden there's all these men possibilities that they can do what we're in is half their fateful land up and they stand up taller they even start dressing nicer that also makes people consider everything else they're doing and touching and wearing at this really high quality had on my head
264.39,272.01, made of good material it's soon really great function let me question the other thing that i wear that i never questioned before
272.01,279.33, inspect its materials or think about how long it's going to last me so it's pretty neat how can change a person
279.78,295.41, so when we decided to buy the hat shop we knew we were buying it in 
295.5,297.66, time economically
297.66,303.6, a kind of go in it full force so we treated our motto which is bringing the haering ing back
303.6,316.38, nations that are good and certain manners and a certain amount of cornish people have forgotten man the idea that jessie is a sign of respect so what kind of bringing back a whole movement that
316.38,319.02, enroute time when people used to wear hats
319.5,323.19, think there's more of an awareness about the quality of what you're buying
323.22,327.06, an investment in well made high quality goods
327.33,372.93, a lot about your ethics and you lifestyle people are starting to realize that if it is worth it to invest using that at last you for fifty years than to keep in the same foldaway that's really important to the four of us here they had that we make and sell are designed to last for seventy to a hundred and fifty years you bringing it back for a very long time basically this can be your companion for life and can even be passed on as a family arline is a picture that we have in the front of the shop and it's from ground breaking it the winners fair in golden gate park and in that photo there is a sea of men wearing bowlers top hats women are just wearing beautifully large brimmed hats
372.96,376.62, and every one there is wearing hats and we want to see that
376.74,378.9, happen again in san francisco
379.11,402.93, i bathe
