0.03,38.64, voice on community straight talk with grisly and morgan making one or two tom and i been awrong in photoplay right there because we're about the debate i don't know if i like one boy some one community adhaerebat morgan is you can go to one of the gasometer thinning
38.67,72.36, we have almanack in the building and also came pottering to you guys morning was going all man you guys have been rocking it with our our presidential debates last couple of months and well ended off the last presidential denotes a archtraitor get into that so was like we've got to do a gubernatorial debate because you know that's going to be very important probably
72.72,125.01, i would argue maybe a little bit more important than it actually the presidential debate if you live in north carolina right now and so you have boy cooper versus the incumbent accord me cash her fan of corn mister paraffin of mister cooper in callista's proper man i have to anointing his bell and get it all so first i want to start with with you alone you you said that you felt like petronius and to give you a couple of minutes to back it up meantime show now several times so i think you all know though the issues that i tend to find more important or things like the jobs and economy infrastructure energy you've heard me talk a lot about over the years
125.16,140.55, and i think people forget the conditions that the state was in when govern more actually came into office four years ago we were number five and in terms of unemployment now we've got the lowest unemployment that we've had an eight years
140.64,157.14, we had actually taken on around billion and finding from the federal government in terms of loans to find our unemployment insurance trust funds simply because we were going through a massive recession because of the policies of governor paniculata repaid that money
157.2,184.05, and that's pretty huge simply because in order to get companies attracted be coming back to the state we had to show them that we could pay that debt off because they don't want to move to the state and actually inherit that debt so that was a big big move on corinth other thing is when you look at the state budget we hadn't had a surplus and i don't know how long under governor where we've got to forewent five million dollars sure budget surplus
184.11,232.98, when you look at transportation and infrastructure something i think is critically important this state primarily used to use what they call an equity formal for transportation funding which obviously shifted a lot of state dollars out to roar as did allow a lot of transportation construction to go on an urban areas it you go around places like roland charlotte and eileen now you see a lot of transportation or or a lot of infrastructure i'm development happen and that's because governmentally increased funding by seven hundred million dollars i'm did away with the equity formal evening even created a twenty five year plan for transportation in the state he's given his given teachers billions
233.13,258.51, i mean in the list goes all i don't want to be becalmed over here but athanas been a great governor and i know we get called up in controversies like voter id and h b two and some of the other so she issues but when it comes down to what the governor was responsible for doing he's done it and a lot more will get those
258.54,263.16, to go almost at marly
263.55,268.29, because estates we forget about the state of lorraine
268.35,272.25, people forget about the state of north carolina i'm a united states
272.46,277.2, and so for me no latissima microcosm of the country
277.59,279.06, country as improvement
279.27,283.17, therefore no carolina's going to improve we talk about jobs
284.16,290.07, country was shedding jobs puffball when the boma came into office
290.16,291.63, change now
291.66,302.7, change for the last ten years or so and of carolina is just a benefit of that sootily tick for what patmore's actually done and you tell me
302.88,311.04, i like that on jobs to the country and into the state when it first things he did was passed the bolide
311.64,318.78, anybody right my can say outside of the law firm has actually been hired to defend that law is brought jobs to the state
319.05,322.95, in fact to make an argument that companies are left the state because 
323.46,334.05, then he put in the deposit where citizens of cloth to pay for basilicon from antibes energy madison state
334.47,342.03, is that not broad jobs because you know we say lack of regulation are rolling back regulation with bring job to have great fallacy
342.21,348.12, actually i think back in march or share but jobs to save money
348.3,351.99, that's what lack of robot regulation we get you
352.38,359.61, he put in again outside of the law firm the heart to defend that law
359.7,362.79, nityananda broad jobs
363.0,378.36, so for me when you look at the actual reality of what specifically pat moore has done to bring jobs to nogent actually done absolutely nothing and i'll make an argument they had no colonies improving in spite of pat not because of her
378.57,381.18, if you remember if you think about this
381.81,390.48, oh as far as infrastructure the transportation secretary of the united states of america is from chairman
390.72,397.05, and of course he's going we're going to get more infrastructure money because we are his home
397.11,400.71, but the money that we're getting to me
402.36,411.27, we are getting get because obama's fail i think we argue last time was he failed transportation bill that he put in
411.42,426.45, the money that lorna received was received to build highways and do infrastructure but like i told before the republican party putting in that provision that allowed states to take that money soother things and we did that
426.54,434.97, if you are a member before paris even in office not alone had construct an go on everywhere you saw that beholds says
434.97,449.31, this was a forty five is going to be ready in five years thanks to aeroplane it to just like everybody else has for the policies of black observing that for emily
449.37,544.65, let me ask you that is there is so much as miss goddis commentary was some score cannot let the starshells that patent require real located in the transportation had nothing to do with federal spending that this money actually came from the state budget we were to spend in on other items that were not necessarily a priority so he actually relocated that money in the right direction at recur also was the first governor of the comalong and ooooo that actually passed an infrastructure spending billet a two billion dollar public spending bill on the ballot for citizens to vote on in the consider and actually got that pass that happened in a very long time the reason why that's critically important is because a lot of the money they got that will be allocated to our port systematisation to
544.71,597.54, money i mean he put a bell on it balliol decided to vote but before his heaven be to do that for dotandcarryonetown heights in charleston
597.99,688.95, o yes so the numbers he was the longest servant mayor and charlotte terms he was the one that worked on the transport he was the one that work with human and charlotte to get bank of america there to get duke energy there is in enterprise in terms that maisie had old to be earnestly yothers norman criminality because unfortunate dost really all you can talk about so you look at what he's done an attorney general and he so innovative and three smart and for looking i remember back at eight nine years ago when i was a school he came and he was already talking about
689.01,698.76, in safety and security et cetera and so now we fast for to these times and you can see that that kind of thing is everything i mean you just had
698.76,704.01, a scam were basically people are calling around pointer or
704.01,726.12, and those are things that i'm sorry to general war cooper was looking into ten years ago and so we talk about vision he cleaned up a lot of the problems are going on with our system the crosse as far as blood testing analysis i said or i'll nominatim going to go in lenhart
726.18,754.32, well with attorney general marcopoli his vision or for the state as far as actually up bringing money into education because we fallen under penholders to all on earth bottom when i say that because of his budget and i know he's increased i guess quoth teacher the money that teachers get but if you if you are all of the eurasians of course you can have more money to give to teachers
754.35,758.88, i actually have friends who were a teacher assistance instead
758.88,766.26, who actually had the basically worked for free if they were to continue to work and educate we've got from
766.77,780.75, basically on education to bottom have and if we say teaches the pay for the thousand hours touchett's do you look at that i look through the nonsense and look at the reality the reality is because of pain is budget
781.14,821.13, basically have where we were maybe two teachers to every student adoration every eighteen and so that's not an improvement to me at all and i believe trenoweth that let me jump here really quick right here just and this is looped so it could be wrong but thither
821.13,868.8, he is the one that has led the transformation to charlotte and made them what they are as you know had a lot of the transportation development that you see in charlotte and absolutely telling you i mean you guys are scattered and courtly did he give the together the largest pay raise in history but he also increased education funding outside the justice increase education fundament thirteenth
870.06,949.44, when do these i know that the thing was kind of pass this here one is that taken effect because there's also a friend of the show that comes on who says that they haven't seen the fifty thousand dollars yet and they don't know when it's to postillion it's based on teacher tenure so i think some of the old teacher for tamaseseites but when you compare state like north carolina to a state like texas in our really doing an apple apple comparison i mean state like textureless euston itself as a community is eighty miles wide that means if we left gainsborough and drove all the latter raleigh now he'd still be in houston so i mean a texas is a completely different state or state like new york even a state like california i think when you make those kind of comparisons between north carolina and these large urbanized states it's hard to make those comparisons and yes if a teacher leaves north carolina and goes to texas or or maybe go to florida or new york a california you are going to make more money as a teacher in one of those states compared to her now because of cotoneaster going state and in fact all still an illiterate
949.47,966.45, to this the reason the reason why it is important to do this way now it's because of that fact right you don't want to compare the total of matermony were spinning out to other states on the largest states so will break it down into basically a purse student bases it
966.57,971.16, and so the money that north carolina is spinning per student
971.49,974.61, the lowest sense what light thirties
974.64,983.28, orter not fortyfour in the narration that i write about that
983.28,987.57, so pestilent bases were spending less money
987.69,993.66, and so if i say a morgan you got the let me give you extra dollar
993.84,998.19, increased the amount of money she has but what is it worth it 
998.19,1011.09, as for me if we are growing and you are not matching the funds of the growth right then it doesn't matter you can say he is increased spending i'm so cool but no you haven't posted
1011.36,1017.63, less than what we were when you got in alencon tell that on the fatal basis because students leaving
1017.87,1020.36, teacher sitting fired
1020.39,1033.89, in the classroom filled his or having less supervision because we were because the running time to some one thirty thirty minutes let me ask you this really quick and then we'll go to h
1033.95,1072.14, with one of the things this also happened is that there was before there was a pretty boom and film industry in north carolina and tax codes conachan a little bit in a lot of film is leaving either going to georgia going overseas going somewhere else or whatever and that happened under macrinus want to ask you about that mister casaubon what kind of benefit do you think that kind of seventh carolina think cordiality
1072.47,1101.06, the general assembly was the one that jumped out and did away with not only the incentives that were going to the film industry but also they did away with the historic tax credit the state history tax credit which really led to the large rehabilitation of a lot of old building so when you go into a downtown greensboro and you see some of the rehabilitation it went on some of those buildings the way they went about doing that is using what they call historic tax credit and there is a federal credit and state credit
1101.18,1175.1, and so the general assembly actually the way with that they did away with the incentives for the film industry and mart was actually some one that that went against the general semble it came to these incentives and what he was able to do as he was able to restore the historic tax credit for the state historic tax credit but was not able to win back the incentives for the film industry so this is a case of where the general assembly and the governor's office really deferred carlotta battle at that because i actually think that the fact that we were spending money on the film ministry became a billion dollar industry here north cannot carolina predominantly down the eastern north carolina weigand think that was something that was good for the state and that's just a battle aforetime
1175.16,1201.95, so he filled those cities in quite frankly to revoking at their downtown are nobody's going to downtown i worthington that's you can fill down there but there's no like a bank of america is not going to live the harrisons the film industry basically makes those types of cities and counties relevant and not only that but you can tell when a general republican part of me in
1202.01,1350.21, they found a bring jobs for businesses they like businesses that will pollute and stores and so other industries that they don't like like film smart industries maybe there out but you do boobootella companies like due power of another polluters he will get their tax breaks and the one of the first things that an industrial quickly that i hate about the republican any move in they merely got rid of the text reality for citizens they immediately changed the task cootonais pay more taxes for the homes as abstainers they were desecration charlotte had no reason whatsoever even create the ordinance that they went to create the ordinance the bereaved was going to hurt a lot of small businesses it was going to cause him that dispetto money all regulations that they didn't necessarily totalitarian
1350.39,1363.89, we are now the laughing stock of the united states to america we just lost the inside a basketball turning to south carolina and so it is no measurable way or the anyone can say that is helped
1363.89,1373.37, and they did respond to obsessions and charlotte by being over salathiel so there's just another reason to get them out of there
1373.37,1393.86, to me there's nothing that you can say that will make up for losing the idealistic in inishmaan acc championship games we just built the aquatic center down and brings borselen separating like a tenement incitement for swimming we lost that
1393.98,1482.54, and so we keep on economic impact of these things are devastating and that's nothing to make up for it there's no mountain give the deepole that can make up for losing all the shoes games billions of dollars now leaving the pickets of look callosities oh that can make up for the fourth billion dollar tax rate they gave to a mendicant commerce conservatories the
1482.78,1484.1, with a
1484.1,1564.56, have the same jobs we have the same infrastructure which i know what we will have to be all a game too and in ten otway for that man to get out of office we can get back to be in the stateliest also remember the gubernatorial debate is on tuesday night at nine o'clock associationist you have basically five days so because by the way you have
