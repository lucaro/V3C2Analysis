0.06,24.03, there was a contest at side of callista up my house for some reason we decided to go in and play like a couple of games painful i went the first gaining and then when the second coolie's go to atuona testified
24.18,29.07, until he finally won game that's all he wanted to do as when one game

72.09,140.31, tharrabas always just more down the earth less concerned about what was going on around him because he was so cool and so chill i don't think people realize how really competitive rapacidae look back to the momentum video there's that seem was playing soccer in the duty faltering and you see rob take his foot robbed but the look on his face like it's a natural thing that lie imbedded in us from the young age if it's playing ping palin the garage whatever you know you just start playing like somebody is better than the other guy why is that isom people take it to a higher legionaries of stories like that with kellynch series especially on younger guaranty don't say anything coherent
140.31,194.1, one world titles retired galante that it looked like there might be some people who give him like actual competition and came back that's creational and miltons or obstacle though too they were pretty close and i think if anybody kelliher robbed the most i've seen so many heats that i come down on between two guys for real and never penthiere between the competitive climate here day and nineteen ninety five it just nittinat's not even the same thing i want three contests at her sonnino of you cineselli one of you countess i was in a sutlersville in ninety five igniting a little
194.13,196.98, all i mean is to do is make one he
197.34,198.42, i lost
198.48,202.26, that left you know the door opened to kelly and rob
202.32,246.36, what i remember it it was kind of a remedy right from the start and you know he'd after he were going and you know he was getting through but the days were kind of oration be little wind and then when the heat came up a kind of it's like everything stopped and then kind of the heat started and it was like we just started in and it was like it seemed like the waves as coordinations grew up get a chance to go for the world trilinear other and get the surintendant
246.69,248.07, point it was like
248.46,250.47, polly friend
250.74,254.34, thought of like a world title or anything with so
254.55,275.04, one in my mind is there mower all that to stop and it's like can you believe this it's you and me and i were here if i may that be competing against each other their whole lives problems right there at the top end for a good portion of his life he still a shed he tells
275.31,276.69, the baron
277.02,278.64, and then we have 
281.4,299.4, i might like surf on it over and over again my whole life and probably that one i think one of the cool things about the hive is it
299.52,314.49, back the curtain until a point is a reputed off and lay poor priority boys and you know it's life intense what the hollies atome i would turn kelly as over like
314.76,337.98, i mean you're in a heat you tanofir like oh like her in my way as he got run over for a share in the world title and he said to say then you know any goes like that man in his speared my board right now his chest but neither what of their trying to be competition got priory there wouldn't be who on this site the hafir
338.04,379.32, i think it's called and to see my kimono happen i was right in line and i just want i sat up on my board so i guess it away imitation that point he had the cocoanut maybe a priority or we are gone he biville to know what rob dialogum is head was at that moment is it like all the yokels the encounter but now well the things you don't really think and those moments and you just kind of god to pilot i reverted back to like not having curseon i think it made a lot of people to look at preserving different
382.71,451.62, i don't know if it was the impetus for but certainly wrong and kelly probably crystallized a duel route as far as professional surface go often do the competitive thing or you can do the free serving but to do the free serayevo have a very specific approach and a very high level of serving or any litigation was a free supersession free surface an age now especially like a baronet they have to look at some one like roncador who started the thessaly carried the same thing is walked away from that man like highland i think professional ring different from that on once i got away from that hole assassinated
451.74,459.78, a professional surfer i think rob always always a soul superfather just so
459.9,500.43, if there is a good line a movie jack within his agitation be satisfied if i ever feel like him satisfied omelike i'm doing romances ultimate contribution to the history of serving is an ambassador of grace i think ramilies the personal genossenschaft this in some ways because it means
501.03,503.94, old
503.97,511.05, and saying render information so like real world is something
511.23,555.51, i get it now the whole weather brown but if kelly my good friend and i personified me while he betime for it he and the rotation around him over pleasure to kill his very competitive which used to drive it not too because we bring them over here and bethinking pompeian golf and detested quite to whence over here i want to shake his hand and he put his fist out and then i felt all these people behind me like they wanted to talk to him and i kind o wasn't thinking and i kind of grabbed his fist and started shaking his fist like this and i was going like
555.57,564.6, doing and a kind of stopped and he kindled me when okay
567.42,573.42, i'm going to look like a door and the senator a jersey but that's how i toiled
573.6,578.1, less to be able to do what i do and i'm going to keep doing it
578.37,590.97, i kind of out sometimes that how fortunate i am to wake up every day and be able to do what i get to do go serving and and travel and
