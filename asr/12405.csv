4.98,15.09, welcome to quicken dirty to tories in this tutorial you will earn a basic understanding of how interlaced and his video works
16.47,21.78, why you might not see all your interlace video frames accurately inform
22.14,24.9, and how to fix the problem are let's get started
24.99,34.92, when you record footage with a concord that uses intrepido technology doesn't capture each video frame once as say hollywood camerados
34.98,42.75, instead each video frame is broken down into two fields with each field containing half a little lines of resolution in each frame
43.98,62.01, tom is an example what a film came friend but looked like on the bottom is an example but a video frame of the lake not much difference of his glance and it was to a close look that video frame and break down is going on keeping in mind that this is an exaggerated example of just for the purposes of the tutorial
62.91,89.1, so what are fields only well one field is made up of odd horse hunt alone in our frame i insane tree five et cetera this is called the outfield or the upper field sense it contains the upper lines of the image the other field is made up of even horizontal interfering in lines to for six et cetera this is called the even field or the lower field since the contained the lower line of the image
89.64,108.15, fields are interlaced you venerable to view the whole image of each of the franks by the way this happens one after the other allies first then even lines which happened so fast is a really even have time in the military so you and of seeing the whole image of the france
109.14,116.07, the wareside of what interlaced video is poetical little bit a problem was having and how we can resolve it
116.16,170.4, in the shut hair and swat guys coming get pulled out a screen and red around the recurs from behind us boxes and actors canacum out and fire a gun four times now the problem is we only see one of the flares from one of the times he fires not all four times was too quick ookjooliks why did this happen well i did a little sir chatelain came across this fantastic out of this world form called emotion devon twain from emotion deeply comrades my best guess is the lower line resolution of the bahima simply lost much of its flare so it usually only remains visible in a single field in other words the flasher which i can't see them the way your monitoring the video
170.4,183.57, so how can we fix this well in penelope when the chemist window is set to eighty six per cent it only shows one of the two fields in a frame so all we have to do is increase the chemist when no tattersett
183.72,186.03, a thing as being real sparkled
186.75,189.9, i decided to make a present
189.96,192.3, but a hundred per cent
192.39,210.09, so just take a look and see if that work as you can see it that way you have to do you an if you set make a present or not as you go up to the slope on her which allows you to select what side are percentage for other you want to be able to view
210.12,222.42, you clip in the camisade and just select anything below a hundred per cent in this case of a slight fifty and then go back up to a hundred per cent and the problem is salt was take a look
222.63,230.73, he and i retaliate is some
231.06,270.72, important things he godamar of one is just because you fixed in foullepointe that your exported clip will have the same results so to make sure that it does there's two options on just got on the time line here and double click on me and clip go up into effect quantitie filters got down a video and select the intellect and the expert your film the way you want to and will work for the other way is on export depending on what cots
271.68,273.15, that you
273.18,275.97, select the interlaced source video
276.15,302.31, that will work as well trust me a testator fine at least for my uses monotint rest is that this problem only arises in final cut pro which his apples professional version of non liner editing software ironically it does not work in the umbrian you cannot have the problem in the home version i moved
302.43,309.03, right well hopefully this help a fellow and thanks for watching take out
