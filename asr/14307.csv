0.03,13.74, etienne
15.42,23.28, the introduction of kyle's talk about what we really housing this conference in copenhagen it is
23.34,54.24, not because it has anything to do with copenhagen you could think so or copenhagen it doesn't it's good for the branding of the city but its unrelated cup is in a privation for conference of the parties in this case conference of the parties to the united nations climate change convention pretty old thing and this is the fifteenth annual conference of all nations of the united all the un nations are coming together to review the convention and what needs to be done but this is a very special cup
54.63,69.84, because where the situation where the kiltartan the first real attempt at doing something about climate change in an international way is about to expire that expires in two thousand twelve people saying what comes after this
69.84,76.17, not like the problem has has diminished in any way shape or form so we need to look at that
76.2,78.21, for at the core
78.27,83.49, you might at wasters ago and he on the island of bali
83.49,92.04, the nations came together and agreed to set a deadline for agreeing or not comes after two thousand twelve in copenhagen a cup fifteen
92.16,105.09, why there's so much talk but just in town but everywhere were about the copenhagen is because all underlined two nations agreed to set themselves copenhagen is a dead line for green on what's next
106.41,116.97, the last was a coin poland which was sort of a sistering stone review halfway of between valiancie had come
120.84,133.65, now this is a small country and this is a big conference and just to put that little bit into perspective in from my desk what i do is not substance but logistics i need to do the meeting here in practical terms
133.65,141.12, and put that into perspective for you the size of this this is a very large conference not just because
141.21,144.42, people coming but also because it doesn't
144.51,158.07, for thirty six hours is most timid but this is a two week event and if i look at the volume of the thing like this how many how many meals a many transportation kilometers how many hotel room nights
158.07,163.23, the cost drivers like now the number of police hours you had a look at the ball volume
163.29,177.63, at times a number of participants so if you look at it that way we actually looking at an absolute super league monster summit about the size of twenty european councils and those few of coverture council will now the dorsetshire events
179.07,180.3, but
180.3,194.67, for this is something of a very large nature especially for a small country were looking at several hundred million danish corners on this on pure logistics and police work the largest bell being police work just 
194.76,198.99, man power of manning a conference like this in a secure way
199.98,217.53, another way of putting it is and this is really where i spoke my coffee about two years ago when i travelled to canada and talk to the former cophos and asking how you do this what is this conference like tell me about about how work might be a little bigger in copenhagen but tell me how it works
217.59,228.27, they threw up this gigantic organic ram on the power point and said this is what our small organization for handing this that's where i spoke my coffee of furtive gotten into when accepting this job
228.27,236.64, but also if you look at it they had a logistic secretary the more than with and communications of countertenor than people so why
236.85,269.04, why we only it's not because we are more efficient than the canadians anything the great help in his oration for us doing many things like the canadians have done but also but but basically it's a matter of strategy with people ascertained if we want to be flexible and if we need for a competent sorceresses puddin perspective what we are dealing with
281.7,287.28, are the first question when you plan a conference is how many do expect to arrive here in copenhagen
288.54,292.2, you look then at different experiences you can say there was any
292.23,299.85, your the cop three there is a little pekinese dance this is showing you for all the cops up until now how many people were there
300.78,328.44, had a power here colwich was montreal you couldn't point it through colwich was in the netherlands why were those two little little pigs will those two were picked because because this took place in winter a cup takes place in either not america or europe the intendancy of higher higher attendants the reason probably being that there are more the more immediate representatives are more indurate around here the area so the participation grows
329.85,336.45, so then you can say we went to cut thirteen and billy and had a new record at hesitation there was this
336.66,361.77, some people say it's the beach back to i don't think so the reason is probably that somewhere between coralie and cop thirteen this whole issue about climate change on a global scale really exploded this is sort of a time frame when a lot of when a lot of politicians gave up their climate skepticism as this is a real proper this is really man made we need to do something about it so it's some people dispeptic well sensate climate hip
361.8,374.61, a lot of people offer will just say that it were still in an engagement period with climate change and this will also take place in company my point was this lightest to say that all these things are coming together in company
375.03,378.12, we have a prospect for a deal just like a kite
378.39,381.81, we are in western europe so
381.96,397.08, experience attendance is higher and finally were still in in a face where climate change is absolutely on the top of every body's political agenda and all these waves come together to raise expectations and the science of the summit and copenhagen
397.59,400.53, will you then apt to that that for the first time
400.56,407.07, all these cups were not talking about a possible segment for participation of head of state and government
407.43,415.32, this has been left for the past ten cups to most to ministers for the environment as head of delegation now we talking about
415.68,434.13, of such a magnitude that many people are judging that would be necessary to engage that level also because there's so many secures involved such a huge financing team to be discussed that is not really something that can lift for ministers for the environment now that the very still out on that and one important day for that look for signals might be to morrow
434.19,440.97, when the secretary general is costing his climate summit in new york to look for that
441.0,442.47, we estimate
442.89,452.31, we expect this is numbers we calculate with the un twelve to fifteen thousand people to be here in this center accredited out here accredited by the un
453.42,457.05, billing a solution to lianhan these yellow numbers
457.08,464.52, ten or twelve it is a key people might say you could have settled in money here are there powell within the margin of error
464.52,467.1, we will survive
467.16,472.5, he might be little ting up here and there but we will survive for in these numbers
472.56,479.88, in trouble not eighteen thousand copenhagen might be too small a city below ten thousand will really get in trouble for how much money we spent on this
482.79,512.25, the same break up the participation devil for the first cup but now we're not looking at just a number of participants or actually also at whose participating and there's one major difference here compared to many other summits and inaction meetings that you might be covering and that is that that's the green part because the green part shows no participation half about roughly half of the participants at these cups of representatives from enters
512.79,522.72, speaking one quarter or journalist roughly speaking one quarter at the actual representatives of memberton discussing the negotiating the deal
523.23,527.04, this gift the meeting a different atmosphere
527.1,576.45, comparing to other summits that i know one that was here to you and social summit which was for comparable size on a twenty head of state and government participated in that but the ingas were outside also compared to european council which is to the summit we know best in the foreign ministry and the atmosphere is just different here you do get the alternative feel to it it's not just the time from the suit a talking has a different atmosphere when the ngaraiso numbers but the ends this sense are not just the green and joliete world while life fond of green peas and so on these are also business enos representing all interests and so forth all times which are credited by the un some will not be accredited by the un for different reasons because there to young wudn't have the right
576.45,598.8, and procedure are not having show on a consistent commitment to the climate issue whatever they will also be coming to copenhagen or outside these numbers but there is a parallel meeting going on captain also specifically for into that not accredited out here in copenhagen which is likely to be a lot more colorful and what's going on out here
602.37,637.62, i won't be with you reason how we divide task but just to tell you that we set up basically divided the task into verse negotiations in substance we set up a ministry for climate change and entertainment that is done to by the foreign ministry for another parentine and finally there are business related activities because when we do this
637.68,655.92, when a country like a play host to a conference of this size of course we also have business interested not the reason why we are investing in it and came to lugaid it the ideas about this came later than the actual idea of setting up the meeting but but climate related technologies
655.95,659.22, cleanthis our fastest growing export
659.43,676.65, we do have solutions to offer in this field and therefore of course were trying to create a platform also for our companies to come to market with the message that the guys are the negotiating the deal directly solution ready on the table to be selected and implemented if the politicians decide to do something
676.68,677.85, about it
681.87,687.36, this is the menu for a guy doing logistics i won't bore you with everything
688.08,698.4, one little point and that is this is the usual stuff you this is what you do when you host a wedding this is what you do if you do a large conference it's always the same is just a matter of mature
699.3,713.4, this time around there are large expectations i would even sometimes the extreme expectations that we do this in green and sustainable way logistics this time around have to prove that we can do it in a completely different way
713.43,715.98, now that is a difficult thing to do
716.19,719.1, let me give you one example of that 
719.1,721.44, had these plastic bottles
722.1,725.01, which is from a climate point of view a terrible thing to do
726.0,739.2, person told me that producing one leader of water in this way was about letters of of drinking water and it also of course intense lot of unnecessary so to emissions just from the transportation alone
739.23,743.79, really a courting to do if you have high quality tap water right artist
743.85,755.88, but justice this is the easy thing this is what i usually do you take a couple of trucks filling with halfpence this and you put them in on the table the conference centres as they drunk waste is easy to put them in the best
756.03,762.81, whenever the table is empty you put some more bottles up there that's easy but it's not the clime of friendly way to do it
763.2,788.97, so what we've decided is as just an example that won't be any plastic bottles out here for the conference we put up little automaton might have seen one arthurine kodaking water directly from the net and front from the tap but what do that you need to start calculating what is the actual what is the actual drinking levels expected in each part of the centre
789.03,834.39, nipperkin from will withering them from from cornstarch cups or maybe recycled they procure or should we are for portliness reduceable editions that crops that they need to be washed up according to schedule need to have it a guiding round with a little charley picking up the cups and washing them up and putting them back but to do a getulian you need to calculate how how much water being drunken which parts of the centre so that you can have the main power set up the right way this is just to tell anyone to communicate to all the legations coming here are usually get the message don't drink the local tapwater you have to tell em it's okay here and here are here all the analysis of why this is okay precisely on this spot
834.87,842.85, my point is that it was what is usually a very simple artistic task if you want to do it in a sustainable agreed way becomes
842.88,845.07, almost a complicated
846.06,856.89, when you hear media reports in december about some corner of what we've done here logistical not being the greenest most distain way to do it some carpet material
857.07,865.68, some energy used in some device in the kitchen or whatever send me nice thought and say well it's not that easy to get everything on the control
869.19,877.47, when we do greening for a conference like this reading is actually only priority number for priorum one is security
877.56,884.88, we will not put any delegate into a little electrical light car if they need a politely
885.69,919.35, secondly but justice will in or into the very bones support the decision making structure of a conference like this we will not make greening measures that in any way hamper the efforts to reach an agreement in cognate le would not be hungry they were not be cold they will not be late and they will not be offended by protocol in the way we treat them here that would not be a climate friendlier proach when we discussing climate policies thirty then were not even a greeting as the topographer priority is cocain that suited her
919.65,956.01, then just picking the greenest leo for head of state government government you will see us picking a a host of technologies so you will see hydrogen cars used his second second generation fires and all use hypocaust fusees and soon biogenetic vehicles and so on so whole many of them which is more important to us show casing the territons for the way we usually do things rather than just picking the greenest option itself then finally when these things are in place and then the forty is doing everything he can to try to make a sustainable conference
956.85,963.57, sustainable conference that has to do with number one cutting away everything that you don't need
963.63,969.33, example is you just put your little conference kit out here the banks goods and so forth
969.39,978.96, we will be doing absolutely none of that this conference as a strict zero if policy there will be no conference kids no back no frisbees nothing like that
979.62,1001.64, save us about four million danish corner these money had then been put in to a scholarship so that instead the soused in a more tangible way i believe by inviting eleven students from all over the world to come here and do their full founded master in climate and energy policies at deniers and they have arrived here in september first and have taken up their studies
1001.91,1014.84, help us by because some people would be it is appointed when they come and look for their goods and there aren't any so you can help us a little bit by pushing the agenda and explaining its probably a better way using resources
1015.32,1027.14, that's the first thing caught away stuff you don't need the second thing is then to try to reduce the cost and the emission from everything that you do have to do for instance transportation
1027.32,1044.27, here instead of setting up all the bosses the shop of people back and forth to the hotels we have simply said tess existing public transportation including the metro for in return is free of charge for the two weeks that you're here natasha producing a mission from participating
1044.72,1083.54, tis then you will have a recital of your tomasso from a contest like this of a large nature nightpiece of it actually being from flights to and from copenhagen and the danish government as tensed we will offset that by supporting projects and the rest of the world which are coughing back equally onset emission cetinje or other projects abroad so that we soothe carnations from the confident self off you see people jumping immediately to the third step we don't do that the first two steps actually the most the most difficult one cutting away if you don't need to do and reduce the emission from the activities that you do have
1091.4,1097.67, quickly about staying here if you should be coming here to cover the conference there basically three options
1098.03,1104.6, the usual hotels there are expensive and copenhagen particularly during this time for of course they are there
1104.72,1106.55, second option is one in the middle
1106.58,1146.99, you're looking for housing in the private apartment we've set up a potato you can get an apartment there renting it from a private in its more antient in can stay there with a couple of colleagues and you can do your own cooking you can stand we haven't tortured and what they aestheticism forward and host a climate guests for free during this period and presided to say that they have already managed
1146.99,1155.03, getting families to sign up for that which is wonderful because it shows a city in a more hospital way and it also
1155.21,1177.89, has element of people to people so that the danes have a feel of what's going on in the city with a they can get to know the people who are there here as activists as journalists as delegates for the conference and also the people coming here have a chance to actually getting to know the danite bit about their country and what it's like you are not just being at their hotel and the billets
1180.26,1183.47, finally i just want to point you to
1183.59,1206.72, rite which is the basic for information about this conference has fallen and it is not static like any other ritter you might dig up to this supposed to go in available in the six and languages plus danish and has a lot of things not just on practical issues but also on the debate and such and all sorts of interactive measures on indulgent
1207.08,1210.53, oh my minutes and i thank you for your attention
1210.59,1214.01, i
