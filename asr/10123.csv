3.0,79.29, texas is booming our cities are growing and the population is expected to almost double over the next fifty years the drought of two thousand eleven has made texans increasingly aware that we need to plan now to ensure plenty of clean safe drinking water for our future a growing trend to meet future water needs and texas and throughout the world is for communities to cycle their existing water supply for the dolls fort worth area west texas and many other areas water recycling is the best option to provide a safe drought proof cost effective source of future drinking water there is meenesters frohnatur process as oriana treatment school children learned that we humans to day drink the same water the dinosaur strange natural processes filter and clean the earth's water so too can usoga treatment which cannot mimic that inside of a engineered system and make it more compact actually much faster
79.44,123.36, recycling begins with water that has been through a waste water treatment plant so it's clean enough to be released into streams and rivers or cycled water is given additional treatment either clean enough but back into a city's water supply lake or in some cases purified sufficiently to be ready to drink treading water and enough to put into a water supply like involves removing nutrients that might cause the lake to have alcibiades can be done in recycling facility that uses high tech filters and other processes designed to remove excess nutrients another method use special man made weapons such as the beautiful east fork wheatland at the john bunker sands wetlands subter
123.36,146.76, well and project with designed to actually filter water native aquatic plants that were planted in the well and by hand take out about seventy per cent of nutrients basically nitrogen posters in a monitor other part of the stories the bacteria that's hidden under water surface the bacteria actually using the waste products of their food as well and that claims the water the plants clean water and also the sunlight naturally filters the water as well
147.12,190.86, when reclaimed water is purified to save drinking water standards and put directly back into a city's water supply it is called direct potable recycling direct recycling utilizes two basic technologies membrane filtration to remove bacteria and viruses and disinfection to kill any remaining organisms membrane filtration such as alteration and reverse osmosis uses thousands of specially designed membranes often shaped like tiny straws water is forced through microscopic pours into these straws filtering out bacteria biases and other impurities erremel high pure of water
190.86,277.35, infection consists of treating the water with ultraviolet light and other methods such as conventional chemicals to kill harmful organisms this combination of high tech filters and disinfection can produce water so pure that it can be put directly back into a city's water system the process is carefully monitored so not only meets water qualities standards it exceeds them on a progressionist to water it is very good very steadily for years the filtration of landsmen order to ensure safety water recycling facilities are required to both filter and disinfect the water multiple times to produce water that is cleaner than most of what we drink to day this is referred to as using multiple barriers the realistic barriers so that if there was some type of upset on one barrier that you have these paupers that's the key to having done a separate record additional technologies are merging to facilitate water recycling among them one a forward osmosis and underground storage and oliver
277.56,349.14, the benefits of all methods of water recycling are far reaching in many cases water recycling is the lowest cost source of additional water supply it eliminates the substantial cost of building new reservoirs and limits the distance water must be piped recycling also avoid the added water loss due to evaporation from a new reservoir recycling has a much smaller environmental impact then building new reservoirs by avoiding the need to flood productive agricultural land or wild life habitants advanced purification facilities using memberin filtration can be added on to existing wastwater treatment plans offering substantial coatings and impacting only a few acres wallenstein sides also used less land than building new reservoirs for example the east fork wheatland covers eighteen hundred acres yet a produces almost the same amount of water as lake leman which occupies twenty five thousand acres another important part about this wellander basically designed something that is not only helping us but i mean you hear the wild life around us it's amazing
349.35,354.33, we have two hundred and fifty four different birds species that we've seen
354.72,364.05, river otter that welcomed the board walk that were on bobcats that rest on the rail a multitude of antibes were helping nature to help me
365.61,430.26, water recycling give cities the ability to efficiently re use the water they already owned numerous studies predict dryer times ahead and an increased probability of droughts lasting a decade or more water cycling is brought proof it takes the water that is already developed by our communities and purifies it so that it can be safely re used again and again when the time comes for your city to decide on a new water supply option consider the benefits of water recycling then chooses source that is safe cost effective and drought proof water recycling
