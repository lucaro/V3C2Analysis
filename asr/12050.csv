222.54,224.76, if the external
226.2,229.59, disintegrator of the society
229.62,231.18, a little bit
231.45,235.41, the ventilation elsinore practicalities of it
236.49,239.1, how i would like to be
239.58,241.29, i hope that
242.91,244.71, in this
244.83,248.46, seriously because now what i see in india
248.64,253.32, toercsvar so you alligators with it
253.44,254.4, you know
254.7,257.28, i don't think everyone has the right to do it

260.73,269.07, whereupon indian musician or western guillaume couture reverts
269.31,273.36, understand this fineness of this
273.48,275.49, i
277.05,279.54, then to little things of
279.75,282.09, beauty studded
282.51,286.47, and me a hard and kept me that beautiful
289.11,292.32, now i was locked up in a
292.47,298.41, i love you now with all the autopilot a beautiful life is not like all
298.65,305.16, with festivities and huntin flowers now is very hard
305.31,318.3, in fact black 
318.78,329.28, in india sixteen to train tention point
329.28,338.91, so that the outlanders to less have some fallen all that is about when life looks at you directly you eye to this is life
338.94,341.52, then quickly into a jar and
341.73,349.11, his life is different so then it goes into the back potentates said oh i won't justinian
349.56,353.04, there is no real difference playing music and the
353.07,354.87, just
355.59,360.93, a description of what you are doing or want to later life
361.11,363.21, just a description of that
363.78,367.2, always existed in music exists
367.65,370.98, that and then some people
370.98,375.45, that information in writing in a book and then it becomes the terrible there's no real difference
377.1,385.59, she alienated then of some one knows
386.01,389.67, from the tail book that okay with this can alone
389.67,394.74, colorful no arcolano color tone really that cold without really
395.16,397.5, the harmonies
397.59,414.6, what can we thessalian of the scale which is the second you know but that sound is already dead i mean even if you did know the isolated
414.66,419.01, because the books say so therefore we can play it if you have the
419.25,441.54, the commitment i think married to it will solely to find otherways being there in no i didn't have obviously be to whatever intent so information even tho i had teachers here the but the cristuff when i really wanted to go into the depths of it i figure on my own so one little thing like that
442.14,444.81, months or something else
445.41,451.83, but now if i tells my student here this arcade he gets it in the second literally the second
452.76,454.35, but the difference
454.35,458.46, just who fully not take it okay i can do that and finish
458.7,465.57, but you have to understand how that to figure that out to spend the aristocrat munition
465.63,488.22, so there's armand a deeper sense of precision towards music stories an example of wisdom filterin the room full of students as it obsolete clenched assertions in the society and what inspires him to look forward to this journey to tremble and overtones in harmony
489.3,493.29, because but this something
493.44,495.15, some reason

536.79,538.29, as to be out
539.04,544.02, so the valet port of equality no
544.02,547.38, going to be really truly
547.41,549.99, effective when people starting that 
550.77,564.3, respecting every one of beautiful society and music an amazing thinking very fine senses feminine lines and between the lines and so we may have to any questions to be asked society he is not right
564.63,575.46, i pushed her own pushed them not taliesin sees questions we been troubled 
576.6,600.06, one little fact eternum the change my life for ever is when i was eleven steel in my old house at the big hall room in the livingroom this to be a good day was a guitar like this kept lathis
