0.06,172.62, my name is p eyes walkrite nationally known sensible artist i am known for my signature i i put it out on the streets to wake up the world the reason i do anistan about a year and a half ago scrapper with following on instead he said polyctor i'm scrapping full siceliots and to gravitatis the painful cislocative is everyone's dream so of course and it's spawners of going to the scraper week after week after week and painting trains and that essentially picking them and using them as my canvas for my exibition mothers are being scrapped there being melted down they've travelled millions of miles across america and ultimately are worth more scrapers
174.06,209.52, the show is going to be a hot militant gallery and maple wood it's like i said it's been a year and a half in the making it's been just a lot of just tearing out how to get from a seaman we moved a train into the gallery and you know i don't know what it tastes to get that but luckily i a good friend by the name of editor who knows how to do that he went and picked up a train from the scrap yard brought into my studio and then really brought that train for my studio into the gallery which was quite an undertaking
210.06,239.97, so about six months ago i was asked to do a massive mural and indianapolis the only stipulation that we want in a meal with positive messages let to this man i'm looking at it and it's this really it's really wide and short and there's forty of them all separated man though surely in box cars each log on the train which i have carried over now to my show has positive messages like instead of the frisco lone on since forgive
240.18,254.37, and it's the biggest mural now in indianapolis but if you want to see that the hatch tag is the moon love train
257.22,307.35, the paths trains of travelled millions of miles and is one of the most concise that we see there in every one's life and their kind of dying you know in a way and i want people to realize that this isn't just a piece of art this is something that traveled across america that now has been reclaimed and hopefully we'll sit in someone's house for the next day after hundreds
307.38,317.61, wait that i've had on me for the past year and a half knowing that oh my gosh eventually i got to get a train in the door and we did it it was one of the best feelings of my life and finally like
317.91,380.58, the idea here it is and you know now it's in there so you know i'm doing this train show and it first thing you think of when you think of trains of the many trains this has been another part of the whole aspect i mean i've always been in transition the past in my life but i never really got into the model world and one thing i want to do translation they see these big trains and freak out that's the name but i mean there could be a whole documentary dispelled on these folks who are die hard trainers and is mostly not the non repeto they like a clean so hoping somehow i can break into that world you know like be the next time the train but for two thousand and fifteen you know
380.85,430.86, take people for this show who really did ben kind of the drive in the motivation for it are about five people one being nick piston who owns the scrap yard my home girl irene she has been completely all a part of it from the beginning i think she she was even like friends with this guy on instruments like mine to go out there and was really kind of the drive to getting this whole train things going and she's a bencher she hangs out in his train so she's really kind of helped me the third being any boer who have known my entire life this is the guy who move the train from here to hear to hear and then i have onesime name of caminero cathie there a lot and then will remove great artist and an had you know has been helping me get for me to be in a sort
434.04,577.71, as are the beginning of the industrial revolution i mean they are you know we had a super train coming up next i mean it's the next generation to trains happening i mean the trains especially that i'm covering or the ones that i saw growing up i didn't see the teentiest train you know and i like the old rusticating nothing sansonnetto their city the socket impressive show but ah want to travel it let the world see a little bit of saint louis and a little bit of art history macatee train back to the city the party traveled to you know could be pretty awesome polarities
