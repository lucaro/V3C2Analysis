514.65,518.49, daggett in the woods and 
518.49,524.61, and surely no trouble knowledge sort of thing what it best part about being the
524.61,535.5, or of the force well this it is a big job i take a lot of responsibility because people just think i just walk around in the woods while i walk around looking for fires because
535.5,547.05, be like walking around your house making sure you have a smoke detector in your house in the forest smoke detector because the forest is my living room and i want to make sure that there is no fire in my living room of course norman
548.25,551.46, most far in the forest
551.58,567.84, a the first could be avoid a lot of fires could be avoided unfortunately its people a playin with matches dropping ashes not putting out their camp fires there are some in starboard but a lot of fires unfortunately start
567.96,575.97, humans and you know we betrothes norman we have never bears never been one to start any fires
576.03,593.28, humans have been known to drop ashes or to not put out their camp fires well good and that starts for we call all the leaves and all the branches on the ground we call just like you need lincolnton makes the fire go in
593.28,602.16, if you don't put out your courage or your drop them at it starts to fire from very very quickly must people being curious now
602.4,606.75, i would imagine when there is a major forest fire
607.02,608.7, that
608.7,612.9, savagely
613.08,632.01, in a low people and ariamenes a lot of people we have to have people come out and put out the fires there are people who live in the forest also not just animals but other people who have in the fire and then also my good animal friends the dears the squirrels the birds they don't have a place to live any more when the forest is burned
632.04,646.26, their homes sullen place to eat kitchens are destroyed or living on we don't have a place to sleep so our bedroom is one it's a force far it's like our house being burned
646.83,650.73, in this area i think to have 
650.91,655.92, beautiful force santasalare of them
656.04,658.92, some things that people who
659.04,662.19, the forest can do
662.22,696.75, well they can do if they're going to go in there of course they don't want to be smoking or playing with matches if they are camping out wedgelike to see them to what's called no traits camping which means if you have a camp fire you put it out you mother and you make sure it's out the other things they can do is just be observant and not to muttering
697.02,710.07, there are dangers that that mark in the fort oh yes oh yes there are there are some dangers it's a very beautiful place to be if you stay on the trail and if you get off the trail you have to remember here in texas 
710.28,722.73, people it's easy to get lost in a forest because there are so many trees and so is fairly flat or gently rolling hills and you forget where you are because it is such dens vegetation in many areas that
722.76,726.78, in that forest and i tell all my good boys and girls this that
726.81,732.69, make sure you are with an adult and you follow the trail so you can get in and out very easy
733.92,770.34, what forest and you get along well normally i have known as a bear that people tend to walk and circles and they they temacin write handed circle so if you get lost when you're in force you should try to stay put if you can i know it it's hard to do or if you can know where the north is or if you see bright lights had to those to those bright lights but always you you carry certain identification if you can carry a compass if you're a young bargrove now and schoolhouse a compass to tell the north the other thing is always make sure that you tell someone were you're going to be at all times
771.57,776.46, though so many people here probably lived here all their lives are
776.55,779.37, especially for people who have moved here
779.61,781.74, there are
781.89,785.85, as a forest land to be enjoyed
786.06,790.95, there's probably some rules and regulations
791.1,834.96, people ought to pay attention to maybe if the monitor the woods to hunt that they may not be aware of oh yes we we tell all hunters to where what's called hunter orange the bright orange veto the rent confused with the deer or other animal or just a tree moving out there that so unified the other thing we ask is that people if they put trash on the ground to pick it up and bring it out with them we you know we bears don't want to step on can because it's very painful to step on a cane with barefeet littleton
834.96,857.97, young you know we didn't put your feet up on the trees what we don't want people putting you know tonicity you know make sure you're very careful don't don't try to colestown out there and observe wildlife and now you see a bird left to harm it in any way you see baron
858.39,862.83, when you go into one of the national forests to
862.89,933.3, and with somebody to stop in an office and let amorous always a good idea norman to stop by a ranger office introduce yourself to a ranger ranges are very important the good people they can tell you what's out there they can tell you maybe we're a picture flowers are in this spring another two or three months it's going to be good season we have inaugurated the district
934.05,941.73, i'm stephen with atmospheres on satterlee been in business here in that conductor over twenty years helping local folks with all before covering me
942.03,947.01, a homoeopath is adamant
947.22,963.39, tantallan blind will see to it that you find just protected apricot budget so come on in the season sixteen twenty two south street and shop with voltige you the kind of service you used to expect female
964.14,992.88, in hiring office workers is to a fortunate morar hamlet they can play people in a temporary basis or full time and if someone doesn't fit in there's no firing or retiring just caledonia temporary for replacement and paying a weekly bill is a lot easier than handling all those paraqueets for dona temporary does that for you and all other people are pre screened and tested so that save time and money i think calling for dommerars just makes good business and
993.45,997.2, and mellow angles maintenant six
997.44,1002.03, reason wines are recognized by the medals they received
1002.48,1008.78, i expect the same premium teachings that the nobel prize are monitory
1008.9,1011.36, a fine dining at compels
1011.39,1023.12, we maintain the flavor and liquefying premium wine but without the alcohol a perfect complement to amelie's a taste of something special to pellinore street magnates
1023.72,1042.74, this holiday season what doing together and giving the gift of time and working with an acetous community coalition we can unite together to promote a safe and help the environment or family can prosper children can develop and learn and where individuals are valued for their union and cultural differences
1043.19,1046.25, matter what you relate or cremate
1048.65,1054.86, opportunity for us to rejoin happy holidays from the cadets community coalition
1056.06,1060.44, understand that you still have time to win that thief
1060.44,1063.74, question earlier was
1063.8,1068.51, sidenote pakistani came over to dinner at the white house
1068.66,1072.65, then it happened and i weaned a bunch of gold
1072.77,1074.0, no one
1074.27,1080.09, and this has been if you're listening this is sort of a challenge to you
1080.15,1082.52, because
1082.52,1084.98, you want the last couple of three times
1085.01,1089.48, and somewhere in this world there is a trivial question that i can stop you with
1089.54,1100.46, but it was a rivalries with us a personal friend was smoking there and he is the deputy forest supervisor
1100.49,1103.58, the national forces and grass lands
1103.64,1118.04, in the rock surely this is only a thirty minute show and you've done so much with the four service than they are have conservation that i couldn't possibly include everything but
1118.16,1125.54, even with the national force system for about seventeen years now
1125.66,1129.35, started my career at the university of florida
1129.59,1133.76, in south carolina and then went to idaho
1134.03,1136.79, been in oregon with the forest service
1136.91,1145.28, before coming here to texas i spent some time in appalachians in virginia and now and then in the piny woods of east texas
1145.37,1148.85, have you been in these tomato years now
1148.91,1154.34, though our forests in any woods and in east texas
1154.46,1157.31, compare with force on the other areas of my
1157.73,1162.95, we have some of the best for sight or lands for growing timber
1163.01,1177.56, you mentioned the fact that we haven't had much sence we've had lots of oyster and it's that moisture or warm summers that it creates a ideal environment for growing the trees and the vegetation that we have in texas
1177.74,1183.98, we just produce outstanding trees and a horse setting here in texas
1184.19,1188.3, anything that's more of a pleasure to do
1188.54,1191.12, they had to drive through
1191.3,1194.36, for here in the deeper
1194.48,1198.02, and i know the forest service having
1198.23,1203.18, and turcotte radio show and found out what's going on
1203.24,1206.54, just so many things people don't know about
1206.69,1217.46, to make sure that the forest day in good condition and available to the people now as i understand it all of us heard
1217.73,1224.51, years ago i may be even less of the big earth on it in rio
1224.54,1238.1, he not only commercial but it was certainly well covered by the media and out of that i had come i think what you call an ecosystem management for asaph
1238.28,1240.92, what is that philosophy
1241.01,1261.62, basically what the chief of the four service tarbert on in washington is directed the forcemeat not that albania and right what he did back in june of this year after the earth summit was as he
1261.71,1264.02, decision
1264.05,1269.33, we went to what we call our ecosystem management philosophy or policy
1269.42,1282.95, and what we're trying to do now is incorporate and make sure that when we do any activity in the forest that we are looking at maintaining that ecosystem both in the short term and in the long term and so
1282.95,1287.33, well looking to remove from the fort system
1287.33,1292.76, outputs water recreation while life timber
1292.91,1301.07, we can sustain over time while not jeopardizing the long term productivity of an ecosystem out there how do you determine that
1301.16,1315.86, well we have the best people that the universities can provide to us we hire biologist we hire bones we hire foresters we hire engineers we hire a colleges we have all kinds of ologist
1316.25,1320.6, that we have a caller with a question that correct
1320.84,1324.74, beloved the question for me here
1324.77,1328.37, we found out what it is put
1328.64,1336.71, so excited about meeting smoking a halo in make
1336.83,1342.14, we have a fear of the wood smoke have a girl friend
1342.38,1361.49, we smoked the probably more appropriate that i don't know i have never asked bochat weaponless and we can't we can't get smoky own camera i but i'm going to across the room to smoke averred
1362.45,1375.56, it was significant other norman insignificant other maybe animism an i don't know i don't know her but if you don't somebody maybe eating fix smoke
1375.62,1376.46, now
1377.99,1380.9, he is the first service
1381.14,1384.47, becoming more 
1385.58,1397.16, mentally aware in our current time that was when environmental ism is a big thing removement correct 
1397.34,1400.46, they are more of an effrontery
1400.7,1410.15, but environmentally correct then now that it was in premises no i don't think so i think we've always been environmentally correct for the time
1410.18,1418.49, knowledge and information as coming out of so much quicker research is providing as much new information every day
1418.52,1423.74, i always been a leader in conservation and good sound environmental management
1423.77,1431.72, some of the terminologies changed we don't talk too much in terms of conservation as we do now in terms of
1431.72,1434.3, ecosystem management ecology
1434.33,1453.59, but the four waters to that was conservation and forestry practices as we know and they revolve so i believe that we've always been environmentally conscious of but we are progressing a moving along as society is but a moment amongst 
1453.59,1456.32, i will to tell me
1456.44,1459.98, a little bit about how
1460.04,1462.26, see developments
1462.29,1464.12, practical
1464.12,1475.97, they've had on our lives but first of all we have another viewers question smoke is obviously very popular here not a one is smoking shovel
1476.12,1480.23, ciesielski up in the shovel bitter
1480.56,1502.55, i always coronation primitive it outside before i come indoors ever carry your shovel inside that's that's a good bear ahead of the heretical again to that really not aware audience to what are some of the practical applications of what we learned as a result of the force
1502.58,1511.79, we determined that we can accomplish a lot of our activities with less intensive
1512.03,1525.29, management such as were not doing as much clear cutting we're doing more see tree type cuts where we leave the seat source out there natural seed source and lo where are reducing the intensity of our sight
1525.47,1532.25, preparation in order to get the new pine trees growing in the new hard woods growing
1532.43,1538.28, we've learned how to do that through research and development a lot of that goes right on here and stevenson
1538.55,1549.23, university here at the porter scootin one of the outstanding forester schools sardanapale recognized around the nation
1549.77,1554.78, on that i just recently learned and probably a lot of people
1554.93,1573.32, watching the show that don't know that the various counties are interior or forest area here received money from the forest right right to me about that well this past year and nineteen ninety two
1574.22,1579.5, the rest that we received for the sale of the timber of the national forest the counties
1579.53,1585.29, that have national forest lands within their boundaries receive percent of those receipts
1585.35,1588.68, this year that amount of the million 
1588.74,1595.19, those bowers are intermediation that has to be used for the schools and the roads
1595.4,1598.76, can't be used for any other purpose other than schools and roads
1599.42,1608.6, oronte rodenstahls
1609.02,1613.19, the athenians
1614.03,1623.63, that i don't know by the county break out i have to i have to research that and get back to you in not
1623.72,1628.91, we've only got a couple of minutes before we go off
1629.12,1634.07, but i think people realize just how important
1634.49,1638.54, for as to our device
1638.57,1640.97, it is it's a major industry 
1641.84,1646.91, it is not only in the light of producing timber
1646.91,1655.01, produces hunting opportunities which brings in a lot of folks during the hunting season at generates income for local
1655.1,1657.53, and buster tourism
1657.53,1664.13, the fact of the spring time loophole come up in the area to look at the dogwoods
1664.13,1670.76, in the fall and come up and look at our colors a lot of people think about the appalachians or colors but we have fabulous colors here in the fall
1671.21,1673.7, so it's a major
1673.79,1677.48, source for tourists
1677.6,1687.74, and then just natural resources so everybody benefits from the forest service in some way of the other anything else generally a like said the public
1687.8,1698.33, maybe i haven't touched on that people are now well this that in that they have over secured and thirty nine thousand acres
1698.36,1710.69, their land out here the national force and texas are the lands of the people united states money for and is making money and its providing environmental buffers to 
1712.49,1715.85, warming and those issues that going on
1715.88,1719.48, it's out there be enjoyed and we want people to come out and enjoy them
1719.63,1738.05, probing with us and now my bewilderin before ull right radiocone back right luebeck with you no caparisoned with a not have a winner to night we appreciate everybody calling and trying and more morning on the radio show i will let you know
1738.08,1741.17, it was london johnson
1741.23,1748.97, we stopped to that time they were going to go eltonhead seventies their hearts
1750.56,1773.3, he
