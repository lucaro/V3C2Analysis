0.18,14.13, the coenobites is the sound of an unborn baby's heart beat we all know having a baby is an expensive process but could you imagine having a baby for someone you barely even know
14.4,36.36, that's exactly what this woman calender a brave mother too who lives in western pennsylvania did in the summer of two thousand sixteen cabin was a serene mother for a couple in oklahoma she gave birth to gabriel alexander davis on june twenty third two thousand sixteen this is the story of talented and the gift of motherhood
41.79,54.9, a right so in college actually is a devout really close friendship that i now call the girl my sister and 
55.44,56.94, she got married
57.03,57.9, like
58.02,64.89, i don't have years ago and struggled with and fertility from the moment they started trying
65.22,70.68, that time i really was too young i was out of state 
72.18,76.86, i didn't think of this process but as
77.37,91.38, obviously when i moved back home as we started hanging out i had gavin at the time i could see the pain that it caused her to kindle around those people that had children
91.98,99.84, when you have a child it is truly a love that you never thought you could experience
99.99,107.07, as much as you want to she came and despise
110.52,123.42, you love him unconditionally through everything and it was hard for her we actually struggled as friends for her to be around even though she was gavin's godmother
123.96,159.42, i hated to see the pain in her eyes for her to not have a child so myself and my husband like really kind of promoted ourselves too like a well calendar a child for you you know how do you want this grasses to go and and it was jokingly but i honestly would have done it for her couple years ago when obviously laura denied me being of help to her i went through an agency started looking for some one that you know would want me as a possible target i applied
159.6,168.0, i really did not think that i would be picked i mean if you think this is a common practice process
168.69,170.04, it's not
170.07,197.64, during financial incentive or anything obvious that's not the reason why we were doing it but you know can you talk about that little bit yes you do get a like a spender supplement a month you hetaera amount for like vitamins and the cost of fuel to go to doctor appointments in the time and then you do get a lot manorhouse carrying and that amount i know can be large i'm sure
197.73,224.01, people that are very wealthy would pay a lot more money because i was a beginner i was set at the lowest amount of possible and i think it's fine yes i would not have been picked if i would have said money was my incentive here i mean i can't do it it you can't quit your job to do this but it is nice because i am putting forth a lot
224.67,228.69, after missing things with my family that
229.56,243.45, i would be doing you know if i didn't have a child so it's nothing i'm going to retire on it's great that i can think of a school on with it but no it's nothing it's nothing in that
247.44,257.22, you gottshalk serapes or like once you were able to do this how took
259.11,270.78, the family reaches out to you were you connected with the coordinator and if the agency this woman jane is her name she's wonderful in
270.84,273.33, she calls you and says he
273.51,279.63, early very old you want to you know i want to continue this process i actually was
280.23,284.64, in the process of ollie getting in vitro
284.82,289.47, before the failing kindred off the face of the earth like literally
289.47,298.17, didn't hear from them we have done all the paper work we had met them twice they had taken us to new york city like wine and dying thus
298.35,299.58, then
300.21,307.05, we didn't hear from her so that kind of couple obviously didn't work out
307.14,330.54, but within my month or counsellor reached out again and said he we have this other couple they live in oklahoma city though not really sure about you know the distance thing but would you like to hand of be on an interview with them and it's a found interview and we talked have basic
330.54,336.45, facts about us as if you were questioned that may be the
336.69,338.07, the
338.67,347.13, application devatas but within a week we were all aboard ready to
347.19,355.68, they flew me down to a woman city and i met with fair doctor they wanted it to be down there which made sense because
356.07,363.51, she and he had their eggs and sperms obviously in that facility where i would get the
363.72,372.84, transferred on there and then everything else would remain up here so that morning i wake up ready to go on
373.77,379.59, i go into this like hospital room and
379.83,398.43, they tell me the process and you know it's just literally this little tube like so to tiny attach to what looked to me like a needle and they just inserted and they say he there's too little amrita are going to kind of attach
398.49,423.09, and out of those two hopefully one take so a week and a half later i got to take your pregnancy test and i was pregnant to cango back to the whole process of like literally a happy man it is not my egg in a does not my husband's spear i think that would change the process a little bit
423.27,433.74, because that would be a piece of us this is all then i'm just holding on to him taking care of him loving him 
434.22,442.2, my family is doing the same like my oldest one you know comes in still touches my tommy and says the baby awake an
442.23,454.44, then moving a mommet be hungry because he's hungry you know but he also understands he knows that this isn't one that's going to be coming home with us like his younger brother did
454.65,466.05, but the family has been great by the same all gavin urbane a big cousin again here we're going to need your advice were going to need your help and i think that's made
466.74,481.92, no better situation my mother in law wants to be there at birth and love on this baby as if it was hers and we've said that we're cousins were aunts uncles
482.04,483.09, he
483.75,484.62, he
484.68,493.8, it's been great shockingly because you know i think sometimes we think our families are so old school and
493.86,497.67, i think my parents were hesitant just because they know
498.3,504.06, of course affect me but i've taken such a positive stand for this that
504.75,509.43, for my mental health hasn't come into like question as to like
510.0,512.28, i want to keep him it's
512.76,514.44, different

528.03,530.85, there are i fear
531.75,538.35, i mean you have that fear that something seriously to happen
540.15,542.94, doing it all for something else
544.59,549.54, but because i had two healthy pregnancies
549.9,553.89, i hope to god that this one against

1062.09,1317.9, this storm will this sorry at a long time ago when i was eighteen years old and called weepin the whole isidorito was just now in a doctor they came to me i found out that i had been menschen young to get it but i kind of went through the process and grieving that that that we disease aide with that craniology and i do not care with that within about four years ago after anger agot married we started talking about kids and and we went to my theologian the treatment i have been going on has been fairly aggressive to get my symptoms at bay but i think that was malthrating about his wholesale to find out when a racketeer a child not that can conceive a child but to carry a child and rest to me and my child and we eschews it worth putting a child at risk or myself benightedness herricote motherhood her you know teaching me through her sense and his apparent her sense and mother what it's like to have a party yourself toward somebody else and i think she does as a wife as a mother and she did that for us the selflessness of her dustiness rinbod better counterattraction family and that's one of the biggest
1318.35,1345.32, spect to the regard that i wanted to share you know that there's so much good that's going on right now like my life has literally changed with this process and the fact that i can educate those that you know don't know anything about it and rigor to the fact and you know maybe help those that
1345.38,1349.91, would like to do it but still have like some stipulations you know this was
1350.51,1351.95, my story

1390.59,1409.97, her before and i'll continue to tell her that every time i look into gabriel's eyes you know she's a part of this she might not be as biological parabases in part of him she was a part of that she's a poor family she's not you know some friend and business partner she is part of us
1410.24,1446.48, i'm an english teacher by trade but there are no words no words adequate enough to express our gratitude and i think your family support the fact that our families have been able to come together i don't know that this would happen in every circumstance the support the loving baudenave been of the epicier of this and our family you will for ever be in our family parts for this blessing this gift for god that you have made possible
1452.15,1478.31, as the family are born into that there's the soothsayer to the family tie and and i first family that fine too is a partialities part of the family that finds us think that something had hawaiianised out there like family continentals will be
