0.15,15.87, he
16.2,154.26, from sunrise to sunset brister has at all i i'm kylang i'm the executive director of the buster chamber of commerce and this is the best of buster a monthly show featuring the business people of buster and cape cod this month are spot like business is heard pottery and i'll introduce you to potter diane heart she is wonderful and fascinating woman but first joining me here in the studio at tantalizing in northeast ham or jessica larson and mikado who were from the nose youth alone were in a calcalate bit about the nose youth alliance so welcome to the show reconnaissance pondered a donation of two thousand dollars and were thrilled to be able to do that for you you are welcome to what talk about national there are a lot of people who don't really know much about it when was the outlandishness donations
154.71,171.6, that's very true that's really good and i will say the first schools have been very supportive they give us in kind use of the building so we are able to operate both out of stony broke and at school which is really great that breaks the kids up by age a little bit right as we do a large group
171.66,194.88, comparatively to the other towns of lower cape so at a forest the ability to break that group of like just said into stony brook kids who are athrough two and any who are three through five we have a capacity that each facility and we really need that because we have so many kids anchors that to the two eight groups really do work better
195.06,216.87, themselves so to speak in clipping them altogether odometer chaos eacides i think most people who embrace children and remember that terrible too willie with that so as sonachan families and how many children are being served by the program
216.87,276.27, we have about kids roughly and probably about seventy five families casey know just denoting that a lot of those kids have brothers or sisters that are on the program to and we get a small inflecting the summer of nooks who aren't necessarily embrace as our summer program it composes any one not just brothershire the school program is just britishers arromanches sumptuosities allandale of weeks and time
276.27,282.3, it is very cool like that so and why that's what everybody sort of
282.51,313.71, so when they talk about it is a nonprofit organization entreats member in and we dedicate this was started by parents that's really important case because parents keep a going parents operated we need a board to pay my who is an employee so it right now i think we have a lovinger eleven parents we have the other not all parts excuse me we couple community members as well who serve on our board which is great and were always looking for 
313.74,320.28, the body on to get involved were a very welcoming bunch were great feniton
320.55,395.04, that's a good idea so eleven board members like the only staff person or the farther some other people who notice and then we have three wonderful ladies in the office who kind to help me run the day to day operations you know the book keeping with the you know and the enrichment programs that we run all that kind of stuff they helped me with that saharunpore
397.05,400.77, where does your funding come from you mentioned members so the
400.89,414.45, parents are the families that have children in the programs are they members of any acts there is at ticonderoga source of cunning do have a number of grants that come to us
414.51,507.75, the selfsame is church was big very generous with us the federated church has been married generous with us we also get funding from certain organizations that give the children boucher had not space from the parents income as well right so we do accept tacherai with that only because of my own background with non brotherton sallower this part of the cave so the voucher program to a little bit about that and how that works for a family with kids if we know that we have a family that's a need they certainly we have an open door policy they come to us and they can either talk to myself susan any one in the office about getting them in touch with folks who can help them as we do understand that there are families out there who are in need and nearly pay that tuition and so we send them to other organizations that are antithetical
509.58,511.32, having to do so well
511.77,581.37, a total budget that's a good question i'm trying to think of and a boy what that might be i missed the budget meaning intestates summer to athanase for that and i know that we certainly keep a we keep money in the bank in case of emergency pasiance funds to be led to the family intention the board there was a little bit more continued hold about the budget when you have parentintins takes a while to pull it together but we have had a great alteration to us for a apocynaceae and really helped us letters right now we're in a pretty good place it can be a little difficult to juggle we were talking about vouchers and vouchers don't actually replace the full cost of aristocrats a budgetary gap you know we have to find ways to deal with the toneladas
581.46,608.37, and from the health and human services committee and that was the first time we got bad that was very helpful as well and wildness in for that i think it has deserved it at the great way for the town to help the kids rightest thing we ever wanted to as limit the amount of vouchers we can take we don't ever want to we don't never want to turn in butaritari
608.43,619.8, talk about the program because i think that's the crux of the whole thing and you know the back end stuff that we've just talked about as important and valuable but the programs are what make the kids happy so
619.98,767.16, summer programs in particular what kind of activities do you plan for the children ah well we have a variety activities typically we go to the pond almost every day till long pond where i with that up a little bit this year we're going to reduce the number of times we actually go to the pond and create more activities at the sight we also have field trips we go on at least one field trip a week big field trip it the whole group with its red sock game wallenstein organisation with athelwold be so cool for the kids to understand where the food comes from the intolerable that were blennerhassett end of the school year exciting to get that gontemblate farmstead
767.31,792.93, where things come from it doesn't matter whether it's food or whether it's money to help them have a good time and they start to understand that they start to appreciate me more i think by so wild that's really cool now the after school part of it those are enrichment programs as well more amore structure than the summer stuff the school program is a little bit more structure than the sum retrograde simply because i mean
792.93,833.85, they're coming from school which is a very structure ironville we loosen up the reins a little bit because it is not coscoroba but they still have you know certain times where they're supposed to be doing certain things you know they come to us as a way that's probably good because it's better than sending them home with homeward to do with family sufficiently old husband
834.0,850.65, i'm very proud of my personal in connecting with a staff of the schools to make sure that we're really meeting the needs of the students as they come out of their class rooms that oneing we really improved this year that's cool so you've really extended the school
850.74,923.52, yet were we like to think of ourselves extension of school what's your background i come from a parergon actually i worked with kids for a long time but really used to element as was the most important thing to me i love working with kids i love providing them with opportunity to make themselves better you know what an that's a number one goal to give them a safe in their train place to come after school and enjoy themselves and in the meantime if we can teach them about you know manners and being a good person and treating other falling the rules treating others as you want to be treated all those types of things those are those are the things that we focus on my watch to man acetanilid and you are amazing they are like little lemmings say come here they come here but by isagoras really impressed with that and the children were all very very well behaved and they you know and you let them play and run around to which i think is important 
923.58,931.62, that they've done that which is really cool well if somebody wanted to get involved with naivete do how can they get hold of us
