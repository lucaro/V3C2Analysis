0.24,6.81, this was my mother's wedding dress
7.02,8.19, my real mom
8.4,10.23, it was out of
10.32,14.97, but they don't make any more it was a very heavy set and it was discourteous
16.05,17.28, husband
18.36,21.63, the pretty lad at this point you can tell he's kind of
24.6,26.22, this is
27.0,28.86, my sister right here linda
30.39,36.39, dad was the night time manager for bob's big boy when they opened up the chain
37.14,41.43, i believe it was in
42.6,44.1, in glendale
44.61,45.63, and
46.53,53.04, my mother was a carol that when they used to take the meals up to the cars and have the trays and they did it on relegates
53.55,55.14, i was one of those
55.83,59.61, there she was then and
59.91,63.24, he made a good living so she didn't have to work
63.93,66.24, fortunately she was a tremendous alcoholic
70.65,73.92, as a kid you don't realize that
73.95,83.19, alcohol play a big part in our family is just the way things are you know they always had martinis happy hour my mom would sleep in late
84.21,86.76, an adult i realized that she was in over
86.82,88.11, he couldn't get up
91.92,95.76, i woke up one day when i was six and my parents were dead and the way
96.09,104.1, and told my sister that they weren't going they weren't talking to me to give me permission to turn on the t v because i was sick for i didn't know what without was going on
104.76,112.86, he came running out and jumped in the pool and i did my best to help her polly dad out of the pool
114.03,120.69, my mom we couldn't get out because she had swallowed seawater she was pretty water logged at that point and she was down at the bottom
122.28,125.22, to hear people talk about it i was kind of a mess
125.82,128.25, a sad little kid
129.36,131.85, most of my pictures are not smiling
132.27,135.93, i don't really remember being
136.65,141.6, i think i remember being eight i don't remember being the rest of six or seven
141.66,145.92, and blocked all over that out it was a horrific time
148.17,153.93, that's the one thing that life taught me is it taught me to be a positive person
153.96,158.46, regardless of how horrific life events were
158.7,161.55, it was always something positive that happened
162.51,164.25, so
165.24,171.0, concentrate my practice actually on possibility thinking and
172.62,174.42, expanding ones
174.75,178.32, so rather than getting caught up in the
178.62,181.2, because you know it is temporary
181.53,185.46, fortunately so is extreme bliss so you can have to
189.66,194.13, i think that's the one thing that taught me it didn't make me bitter it made me
194.19,199.71, it really gave me a sense of knowing that the universe takes care of us
200.85,205.95, we just have to trust the whole process that things will work out in the typically do
