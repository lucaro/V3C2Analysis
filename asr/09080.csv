27.66,36.93, christ is lying supine obviously with her head on the head rest this is one of those exercises where we want the head rest down
36.93,39.99, short pine or bridging
39.99,46.5, we have her set up so that she had a nice comfortable angle of her shoulder and her elbows of bent
47.01,61.44, emphasis with her arms is going to be pressing up toward the ceiling of christovao tripper this exercise in a show you what that looks like by trying to pull down on the foot bar were not going to be able to execute
61.71,71.91, very good spoilation or car control by doing that and as we know a lot of students really relying a lot of upper body were latissimus activity
72.9,91.38, bring themselves through space into these vertical positions that we do in short fine long spine or roller so the emphasis is on an upward direction with the hands in the arms rather than a downward pull so christian you bring your legs into a ninety ninety or table top position
91.59,98.91, so we just kind of do a little bit of an issuant but hip position and the moonshee full variation with straight lines
98.94,104.16, so she starting off in her optimal final linement take a breath into prepare
104.19,108.06, to stay part against the bumper as she rolls
108.09,109.95, over into her
110.01,111.87, beautiful
112.08,114.54, of parallel legs
114.96,125.79, and up toward the ceiling i was going to give her a little bit of curling through the heels in order a length and through the legs and then exhale christ as you rolled down
126.03,130.11, to soften your stern keep that length through the legs
130.14,135.81, down one photographie and now he's going to maintain the legs straight as she lowers them back down
136.14,139.77, eating now in health to bring the legs to vertical

160.2,164.22, this time chris's going to bring her legs up into the role of a position
164.37,192.78, as you in hell even aim the legs over toward the left shoulder she's going to roll down the left side of the spine but still maintaining that central alignment through the carriage coming through center swinging legs up and around to roll up the right side of the spine then bringing them back to center in hell here carillon the right side so i can really see whether christ is maintaining her spinal linement in space
192.81,196.8, she starts to deviate off the carriage
198.06,202.26, then we know that we have some limousine try deviations
202.32,206.4, the centre okay so into add a little challenge here

253.56,257.07, and rolled out one voted time
