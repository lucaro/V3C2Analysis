70.77,74.28, first of all if you look at the future of the church you have to look
74.43,77.01, the way looks like the
77.19,79.14, future of this nation is gone
79.53,81.42, see me going down hill
81.57,83.97, our nation morally
83.97,85.35, financially
85.65,89.04, so many different ways we see decline they tell us now that
89.25,91.8, i may be a strong economy
91.92,94.17, never known that a lifetime
95.16,97.86, the bays that were seems
101.16,103.17, i see the future church
103.29,105.99, a church that deal with problems
106.29,108.54, nobody else can so
109.14,111.0, diseases that
111.51,114.3, are unholy living
114.33,116.04, for which there is no cure
116.34,118.29, the last hope is the church
118.59,126.75, to the church hoping that god will hear him psychological problems in the achates psychologists who given up on
127.23,128.85, they come to christ
128.85,130.44, so that problem
132.09,140.31, i see the world has no answers in the end and the only place will i think in come is the church and the response of that will be
140.88,142.65, new testament are
142.74,145.02, church daily they were
145.02,146.13, saved
146.58,149.43, then daily they were added to the church
149.76,151.56, the bays the
151.56,155.4, daily multiplied to the church so they went from
155.52,157.35, no addition
159.21,160.29, i 
160.44,165.24, first second church i said knowing
166.02,171.24, obligation from the bible said the last in the bear a great relief
171.33,173.85, i see churches in this country
176.19,183.18, churches that can fill stadiums the cause of sin the need is going to be so great
183.63,185.07, the last stop
185.1,186.39, the church
186.48,188.22, the genoese
188.52,189.87, that 
190.56,193.02, the church can step in
193.08,194.43, enter
194.64,196.29, the world has no later
196.74,205.08, you talked a little bit in there about challenge challenges for the church to deeper into that what do you see the greatest challenge for the church over the next decade
205.95,208.77, none of the challenge the church is getting
210.9,218.64, i believe in organization manufac when there was no organization the church i was a guy saying
219.06,222.42, an his prey this believed god
222.42,229.53, use things that will touch the heart of the people i used to be fond boards to teach the kids now and
231.57,234.87, i think one of the biggest challenge the church is
235.35,236.76, we are
236.88,238.98, try to be just relevant
240.03,242.31, we should be revolutionary
242.61,249.3, church was revolutionary i believe it's wonderful use other churches as examples
249.42,253.02, we don't want it we can reach the same messages
253.02,255.0, use the same songs
255.15,259.11, every church in america which is fine and well but i think the church ought to be
259.26,269.43, relevant to revolutionary we ought to be on the cutting age we should be right in the songs we should be the church that are riding the patches we all have a biggest
269.43,276.15, in the world to better our schools ought to be better for i believe the christians can do
276.36,277.77, everything better
277.95,283.98, the world can do it she there's a phase tacher goes through every great church is born
284.55,286.5, born in confusion
286.65,289.83, when a church on out and begins to grow
289.98,300.87, confusion there is actually chaos in the church growth is chaos a numbers we don't have room for them we don't know how to handle them were not organized
301.08,301.98, you know
302.28,305.16, amongst chaos was where the mayor sat like
305.7,308.1, church is in case
308.13,315.51, financial americans and godlie they mean physical and middle miracles and god
315.54,318.36, she however
318.72,320.64, if you stay in chaos
320.7,323.7, destroyed there comes a time
323.88,325.71, this from
327.21,328.38, control
328.65,333.57, you can't have too much control because of the church's totally control
334.41,336.21, you take out the element
336.27,340.83, miracles in signs and wonders so all a church
340.98,343.29, to be free to let god
343.29,350.88, there has to be some kind of control organization so it will not destroy itself
351.0,362.19, of travel a lot you have been all over the globe in your fifty plus years of ministry and especially in the last three to five years you've been traveling a bunch
362.46,377.73, you've seen the global church so talk to us what is the role of the global church then how should the american church interact with its global counterparts you know the share loeben ten countries and held conferences all away from
378.0,380.16, on church
380.43,382.32, call me his pastor
382.5,384.09, all the way to
384.09,386.19, a night in fuller
386.25,396.93, and i had an opportunity to doctor colborn i've seen what god has done to so cora so i have some one hand
396.96,398.49, the church to day
398.91,401.13, used to be that america
401.43,404.52, was responsible for evangelizing
404.52,409.2, and i think that's why god bless america because
409.5,410.82, we had the money
411.36,419.19, and we taught our people and revival came to america and so we went to the world we see missionary we built bible schools
419.43,426.54, all over the world and because of that many found jesus christ well something's happened recently
427.11,428.49, america
429.09,431.04, turned away from god
432.18,433.38, all
433.62,435.03, down hill
435.45,437.58, other countries like india
437.79,439.44, a great revival
439.56,443.34, well the gravenstein
443.94,451.74, every one of those countries are prospering brazil another man an emerging country its prospering
452.4,456.24, i recently asked me joy my her husband
456.24,457.86, i think that is
458.04,462.57, said some thought was profound he said as america
462.78,464.67, tom the light
465.18,466.53, these countries
466.53,471.93, turning towards the light and righteousness exalting nation
471.93,474.9, in reproach and a people so
474.99,476.16, our role
476.37,478.2, the world today
479.1,483.36, and missionaries and now the greatest churches in the world
483.39,484.8, not in america
485.04,487.17, there overseas
487.74,491.7, just came from a church that six years ago ran fifteen hundred
492.27,495.3, a building that sets in thousand people
495.66,497.01, showed me
497.28,499.29, property they are just fine
499.77,502.56, they're building their intensity
502.74,508.44, a church right on the ocean overlook in the ocean that see a hundred thousand people
508.86,510.48, the time
510.72,512.22, that man
512.85,522.24, talk to me he poured faith into me he shall be the hospital it was going up that he built the orphanage that bill the radio station that he bought
522.63,525.09, pump vision in the
525.9,528.27, that's what is happening in the world today
528.51,530.43, dream center that we have
530.91,532.56, rebuilding all
532.68,537.06, offering job for you see from the dream center and not come from america
537.72,539.97, come from overseas
540.18,544.56, so we used to mangle them now they
544.62,549.54, setting the pattern of good works for america it's important for us
549.75,550.98, it 
551.1,552.63, listen to them
552.78,554.58, the lead now
555.03,559.26, because god is unbreathing and there heard from god
560.1,561.69, on passing
561.9,578.73, a while now here over thirty years old but how is the church changed operation ally since you started a passing as her the question because when in my early days and i saw my dad and
578.91,581.61, he martialled him
581.85,584.28, pastors role was to hear from god
584.82,586.62, the vision from god
587.07,588.21, the building
588.36,590.43, in the background right here
590.58,595.74, heard from god we got the measure a big dream a dream he was bigger than us
596.01,597.51, the role
597.75,599.43, go to the church
599.64,601.65, articulate the vision
601.86,603.39, then the church
603.45,605.07, behind the pastor
605.19,607.08, we marched towards the 
607.26,611.01, that's the way we build the churches and on generation
611.19,618.45, he is completely different to day i believe that leader still here from gottingen the vision that god is put upon his heart
618.96,620.04, now
620.04,622.71, are built with teams
622.74,628.68, new generation believes in community small community of little teams
628.83,632.19, put all the rain thrust together
632.19,638.04, and they built it i used to go to some of those men i met now and i thought
638.25,643.05, i can just answer those questions by myself however
643.08,645.6, there was a comrade
645.87,647.22, there was a passion
647.34,650.46, dividend they seem to be able
650.73,652.08, the
653.49,661.47, the minimal things the details they were able to work out better so my generation was
661.65,662.88, and
663.18,664.77, much of it to day
667.02,670.59, a challenge that i think many pastors you know
670.62,679.14, every one is so busy there so much to do being a pastor of a large church small church it doesn't matter you have a million things going on
680.61,684.51, why doesn't the church collaborate is it because of that or
684.63,693.42, is there a way that the church can collaborate more effectively even despite our business and the amount of work that we have to do every day
693.42,702.0, an example we recently read that in the city of phoenix we had four hundred kidnappings last year
702.39,707.88, only one city in the world that had more kidnappings and that was mexico steady
708.12,709.65, we were almost like
709.95,712.44, capital of america
712.56,718.89, and one the world so we realize something need be done about the human trafficking proper
719.4,727.35, a passenger in the sea with a wonderful intent they were going to solve this problem as we collaborate together
728.28,730.14, so he began to think about it
730.32,735.36, i began to watch them and it seemed to me that was awfully slow
736.05,740.85, i said you know what we're going to do something about that we have a dream center here
740.94,742.53, already in place
742.56,744.57, we're going to court with him
744.72,748.14, just wait while these old girls
748.47,753.48, and in traffic while we are waiting we've always taken the attitude that
754.38,755.82, in the mean
756.18,758.67, and we will learn how to do it
759.03,761.46, we are taking care of the net
761.58,763.11, to work 
763.26,766.41, became an authority on it and to day
766.44,769.44, the largest human traffic networks
770.58,771.75, the nation
772.05,774.03, because within
774.6,781.74, danger sometimes why pastures don't cooper a great church like this if we see needing our city
782.46,785.31, i say but easy for us
785.97,789.72, our church all together to get the people on it
790.2,791.79, raise money for it
792.0,796.71, instead of having to go from one little group to another and often times
796.89,798.18, down
798.27,810.24, a lot of pastors their protecting their cars and really at noting their own fault some time it's the lamentation the problem because they seem to run
810.3,811.53, every
811.53,814.35, direction the world past or feels like
814.38,820.5, got to protect his term just a little bit and he find some time it's easier
821.25,823.08, he can do better
823.2,827.91, a great church behind them and stood jumping through all
828.06,829.53, hopalong way
829.53,836.76, the church can get together and should get together we may not all agree on everything doctrinally
837.36,839.25, we agree upon
839.31,840.54, the loss
840.75,841.71, in
841.83,842.76, poor
842.94,844.83, the 
844.95,846.39, a man
846.78,852.09, in this age we can do better collectively in speaking out
852.57,855.48, especially on political issues
855.84,858.93, because of my biggest fear about the church today
859.14,860.85, that we are framed
861.39,863.7, don't want to be politically
864.0,868.41, correct and through the years the church is always
868.68,870.18, time has been
870.24,871.74, a correct
872.37,874.14, so today
874.2,877.98, church can stand together together and say
878.61,883.26, still believed that abortion is wrong we still be that marriage is for
883.44,896.61, men and one woman we can take a stand collectively together because there is more strength in numbers and we were being together in these times and by the way though
897.06,900.36, a lot of different churches some of a real big
900.42,902.73, it sounded
903.09,905.22, there's nothing wrong with that
905.4,911.94, some of them are like small groups and they fell on some people do better in a big environment
912.3,925.53, so to the ears as churches is split of is not all misery that the use say some time you have to divide to conquer and sometimes although i don't like the vision i like maliciousness
925.89,937.2, many churches catered to the needy and rather than to the intellect or are they doing it we just don't know sure well the reason we do that is because
937.29,939.21, jesus did
939.72,941.19, jesus came
941.88,943.2, press
943.32,944.79, came from the hungry
944.91,947.1, he said it was the poor
947.4,952.68, received him gladly and when the intellectual crowd looked upon it
953.7,958.53, they were convinced it was real because they saw the lame lack and down to
958.59,959.97, in
960.21,961.86, mary
962.28,964.05, they said we
964.11,965.88, explain this
966.15,968.04, things you can't explain
968.28,970.26, stop and think well
970.47,972.0, the world 
972.27,975.99, that began and where i can blow your mind
976.05,978.0, we do know this one thing
978.33,982.14, supernatural power people are touched
982.2,983.37, he
983.49,988.2, ever from diction their lives are changed by the pond
988.83,990.21, i think 
990.9,994.35, leland the same problem and the poor
995.97,999.15, financially tangle bankrupt
999.33,1003.29, stock market goes down they have marriage problems
1003.56,1005.18, rich intellectual
1005.36,1010.31, children their own drugs that they can help just like everybody else
1010.82,1013.73, i truly believe aweary know
1014.27,1016.73, churches been blessed we have seen
1016.82,1019.58, are dipsomania can come in
1019.58,1021.23, and
1021.29,1023.93, first came here i started reaching the poor
1024.41,1026.21, a lot of the
1026.36,1028.85, so called intellectuals
1029.27,1032.42, i lost some of the people that were considered
1033.77,1035.06, what happened
1035.24,1036.95, he replaced
1037.37,1040.79, genuine multimillionaire people
1041.12,1046.28, give millions of dollars of the period had to the church angesicht
1046.55,1049.91, i believe that god will bless the people
1050.18,1052.07, go after a poor
1052.58,1059.15, illustration i'm done in that it allows region the street one day getting ready
1059.21,1066.29, run from finished last angels to raise money to finish the dream inheriting most people know what the dream centres
1066.32,1070.67, huge store building that reaches out to the poor
1070.85,1072.05, the man
1072.8,1075.32, i entrusted
1075.47,1079.97, i saw people crying out on the streets they've been turned out by
1080.18,1083.24, apartments there was no money
1083.81,1087.26, pay for them any more and government and run out of money
1087.65,1091.13, i saw a man saying people in the same screaming out
1091.58,1093.8, i smell human waste on the street
1094.46,1098.15, as i ran through the city i thought how can we build a church here
1098.72,1100.25, i have no money
1100.7,1102.2, no character
1102.38,1104.39, fathers have deserted them
1104.81,1106.67, the city is in anarchy
1106.79,1108.17, no jobs
1109.16,1112.25, the spirit of the living god impressed upon the heart
1112.58,1119.0, so spoke to me so strongly pression in years what it was if you reach people
1119.27,1120.77, nobody wants
1121.13,1122.57, give you people
1123.14,1124.64, i want

1163.52,1164.84, good works

1172.79,1176.57, network of people in our global experience as well
1177.17,1185.84, you see this thing what do you say to pastors that are looking years down the road when he say to them to encourage them about
