552.09,572.25, the picadors and high lights now sharkish reveal and you can read a lot within the channel alone in them drawn to this kind subjects to
572.28,609.3, serious darker edged priapic i kind of like looking like over the horizon that's my interpretation of it but it's amazing the strength that is in your friend's eyes abstruse even yet within the picture that his overcoming and that is so important in enlightenedest you know gave us some raisins tentatively the head but i also like to just zero in on this one and this is amazing i would have

641.49,681.93, strength the industry of the guy what he depicts as he as you photographed them yes and our playing with colors on the background hereditaire picture subtile black and white but obviously i like collation and i wanted some kind of an ass shaknisier i say whether she teaches enable to envelop his own strength that exactly what i see in it i have known you for a number of years i 
681.93,687.24, see you at the field shoots of autographe et parades
687.24,704.4, even major events your progression and how you've got to this explain that to me alone spain what it means for a woman to be able to grasp on to this that so important a thank you and i started actually
704.76,718.23, getting more serious into photography after i finished writing the book journeys through that darkness which is about a photographer and i activities
718.56,720.63, i think i was
720.81,727.05, eraste right towards with the way he was looking at things
727.05,730.11, and i find
730.17,738.09, and i wanted to look at something else other than just that one paper on trains for this hoisted as i started a eson
738.33,746.28, i discover that was more complicated and i thought it would be but i'm not
747.48,757.77, no drawn to what you were desperate a woman to be interested in in terms of subjects yead
757.95,762.3, with that i find photography
762.33,765.54, another way of expressing
766.14,778.92, my opinion my feelings and i hope i tried to do that and i see beauty in the strength of
779.1,782.37, subjects that i photographed and
782.4,785.73, to have some very nice friends to
785.91,790.05, siloing either
790.11,794.88, not a dark aillie but i think that the more serious
796.92,814.38, aspect of life and may be reality and try to express that you know for my images you know obviously some of them are taken in studio i mean everything that had hitherto but i'm drawn to
814.98,822.06, more unconventional subjects like a woman photographed imposes
822.42,833.52, manton tesman for digraphs nosologists interested in
833.61,838.2, environment that's why i love hawaii because he gets laws
838.41,842.55, mother nature and when you
842.76,855.39, self surrounded by more nature by the love of fields or the volcano the dominance or not versatile
856.68,859.77, how a small way or as humans
860.88,866.91, nowadays our conceit
866.97,869.04, the respect
869.46,876.78, and the relationship that we have the connection that we have with nature in general and you know
877.02,881.25, environment protecting environment so 
881.31,883.29, had
883.47,887.28, hurricane sunday on a tear and i shot the
888.09,892.92, rivers of the streets become rivers
893.16,900.78, i'm not interested in my more interested in subjects that my non necessarily considered
902.19,904.29, pretty
904.56,909.96, and with that and for a long time i tried to
910.95,916.2, i use myself i think because as a woman i was expected to
916.92,928.74, certain subjects or you know and i want my interest was in there and i came a point in my life and i said that i had not
929.1,935.1, this is this is where i'm interested to do this the cause is that i want to
936.93,944.16, help you know and to support through my photography if possible
944.34,945.72, and
945.93,947.82, in the white
948.06,950.01, he cannot then
950.22,971.79, he's not in the adoration he picked also a journey of the spirit whatever you photographed it always seems to be and i've seen other person picture along the horizon of new york and just
971.79,999.72, i calculate the spirit of that early morning sunrise as well as may be the mist showing the elements and you know we are all part of the five elements and that's what is so important that's what makes you different from the other photographers i know that you have wedding photographers who capture great portraiture images you also have
999.87,1030.32, the putrescent re action even when you've been even when you photograph here actually in between what we're doing you always seem to capture the spirit i am like one whose good posing and believe in it and he even manufacture and so when you capture those pictures at i look back into my goodness is that the spirit of my reflection at that point in time and so that's really amazing
1030.5,1031.88, talk about
1032.03,1049.07, up and down of fiorsen yes well as i as i sell and thank you for a lamentable i think it's women it is expected about to
1049.31,1055.16, certain rules to do certain things to follow certain
1055.58,1061.37, certain if you don't do that that they are 
1062.09,1064.58, people have a recent to
1065.84,1070.43, point the finger to pratique ridicule
1070.52,1076.16, and it took it took me a long time to get over that
1076.64,1078.95, and i'm fine
1079.34,1089.69, what i do writing and photography i'm okay with the subject that stores that i photographed i do mean leave that
1090.23,1095.48, as our tastes were storytellers and we need to connect with the subject
1095.93,1098.27, and we need to connect with the story
1098.57,1102.62, the level on a depressive so we can
1103.91,1108.5, maybe not completely but deeply enough we can understand that
1109.04,1111.29, subject would there's subject
1111.62,1115.46, when through the story so we can actually
1115.46,1122.66, project that story and captured in words in light in whatever other form of
1122.9,1124.46, when you
1124.85,1128.42, if we cannot connect the subject on that land
1128.6,1132.59, we might create a technically perfect
1132.74,1136.19, but he doesn't have a soul
1136.61,1137.51, and
1138.38,1164.69, the talapoins that's the most important thing that you do not capture this some neighbor american indians who used to say tentaculaires because when you take picture you captured the soul of the person as time has gone on of course
1164.87,1174.5, you know you know magazines that we see from fashion to travel to real life
1175.61,1180.2, you don't capture the essence of what happens
1180.62,1193.73, within the picture a presage as glass over the picture and that s what the photographer warded them to see in the beginning so that very important and any of the pictures that i have looked
1194.12,1218.24, observed that you've taken you always seem to be able to capture that essence not all the togs can do that they have to line it up before they get their pearly know which is that to me is important because you triangles
1218.24,1224.75, that in a moment says and that really takes talent expertise and a drive
1225.29,1230.51, i do believe strongly that you have to be passionate about
1231.2,1233.21, you do but
1233.3,1237.83, the subject and the story that the story that you told because
1237.89,1245.27, sometimes we ancistors stronger or with the subject and as if from a right and i think that
1245.42,1249.08, sort of come through in the in the final
1249.53,1252.11, the final
1252.62,1255.77, i been lucky to to photograph
1255.98,1265.82, like most women i'm not saying that it's always percent per cent in our the futon
1265.85,1273.95, then you know that necessary possible but you have to if you see something in a subject than you
1274.16,1282.68, really belle that is to be immortalized eyes right then you have to show viewers
1282.68,1287.45, what is there to say that you wanted to moralize and why
1287.6,1290.09, wanted to immortalize it in
1290.09,1292.07, in that
1292.07,1294.68, image
1295.07,1298.61, you cannot connect with a view through that
1300.35,1302.63, maybe you know you need to
1303.32,1310.16, work on the subject that you're interested in intricate maybe to even
1310.19,1330.92, your own passion and the development of that passion towards it i think that's important in many of our lives i think i tried to ferret whatever everybody else was to imitate i should for thee and then i realized that
1330.95,1334.61, but it's not what i really want hotwater
1335.0,1340.58, is that that will give my underself onteora to like something that adele
1340.7,1349.55, agree with exactly i mean if you like to orthography the dark or if you like the poorah
1349.88,1353.72, instead of gas or if you like to further graph
1353.9,1356.12, extreme weather
1356.42,1367.37, no i have plenty to eat miscellany have paragraph flowers nothing again for the rotifers but
1368.69,1371.27, you have to find it something
1371.54,1376.28, you really really want to photograph and you might take a longer
1376.55,1377.78, anything
1378.29,1380.15, and then
1381.65,1385.76, then give it to your own sin you know bucherons
1386.12,1391.64, you know modernisation you think that's
1391.73,1414.14, what we all kind of like do and that's what the purpose of this program the special program is today to sinope who have put their own brand i know an elevator but i see it now thank you cause i believe it not you put your own brand on it even though we would not
1414.14,1436.85, the outside you will not but the people who are within your circle are the people who get to know you now when i nominate for grapes or picture relation the age of eighty to tideshole i have and i always say that 
1436.97,1441.71, the subjects are the stories the thuringian should stay the same
1442.01,1453.35, i'm sure the change through the ears but i started a parlotte and then i adaptation
1453.53,1465.41, i became interested in it the maid educational ready subjects as i was surly passionate about so i starlight
1465.53,1472.55, just interfering people always is for orating them too yes and then i found some very interesting
1472.58,1481.37, that alone to paragraph them and it's not the connection
1481.58,1495.62, with a subject like subject of them you know abersethin it's a human being and it it's a personal connection that you have to have there and i think it mantatees a lot
1495.65,1498.44, and i think that can
1498.71,1504.38, this pretty much the same kind of thinking when you photograph
1504.47,1511.85, nature on further whether in landscape salient
1512.48,1514.61, to
1514.61,1516.56, i think you have to kind of
1517.16,1520.79, and things for a second nowadays we
1520.82,1530.24, wine glass through now testimonials
1530.27,1534.08, a franchise rides her first dress
1535.28,1538.04, my hand you know it's the
1538.16,1543.32, just slow down a little bit and think about it i think about what you want to show
1543.68,1546.62, through that for the grapes
1547.1,1565.31, and what exactly how what you want to show and how he wanted show it and how do you understatement you saw in what i will forgather place and that this idiot i mean i might be coming anointed
1565.76,1597.41, it within you just don't just extinguished the deserter and i and over time i have been able to kind of grasp that within your photographs and be able to kindle zero in a what the thought processes and what you're trying to send out to the masses within the subject that you are forebrain so that wahpee
1597.5,1599.45, stories like
1599.69,1605.18, my midland assassinate are activists themselves and
1605.27,1654.62, i'm game through a little bit not a anathematise look like activity mean and the personal journey and whatever it is it seems to reign within the photograph so that what is really very aloofness elandsfontein er for the big original alboin the york city
1654.65,1693.35, i am who are go thank you and i'm going to tell thistleton it's amazing i mean in all the tentative doing this show i have always believed that quality is more important than quantity you could have a lot of people to interview and it still doesn't get a cross if you have to or maybe one subject that you encapsulate and talk about their life and their passion would they do didine
1693.56,1698.87, how does it distorted first ollyoolas but
1698.96,1709.13, what is the petit you know the passion to stimulate what shall we always love music and i always love to dance and
1709.19,1721.25, i've tried to play several instruments although my growing up in a big antennae and high school and you know i found i found myself at a point where i got to a certain age relenting to be this
1721.25,1727.1, music story something was not going to happen for me and
1727.91,1730.52, export nor mind that i was with
1730.58,1771.65, to be for her brother and you should take me along and i love to dance on onomatope years you see you know it actually it happened well over fifteen years ago and i said you know what i do enjoy music i could get people to dance i could do it through being in danger and i swear i thought of my first party that i got fifteen years ago i didn't even have equipment told somebody i am indeed a case that's my true inner passion had my trustin i just thought the making copies every sedation think by went to different friends of mine would different had the missiles with what he now from his rage
1771.65,1785.42, music from the islands whatever disco house and i just thought it making copies of sand you know for me music has been and realize it to later in life has been away from you to release
1785.69,1812.48, i made a reference to a feeling you know so i'm having a bad day in my place something that will get me a crying in that emotion feeling really good than you for i'm going to put something on her i can dance and just get out so you know i really believe it comes from women and that's really a got to it and it just grew from there i got equipment i started playing and i've been at otter since
1812.75,1825.32, you know i yes i do to provide you know joy for me and also an income but i also volunteered in many mentioned the jacob david and that i played for
1825.32,1838.22, cancer events in tone and wayne jersey where i lived for the last two years i do an animal shelter so i believe that's important for me to pursue my passionately have to give back
1838.52,1841.16, music
1841.31,1847.25, priests and you're so right
1847.34,1860.81, what i do because of the inspirit and i think that creative people we deal with such journeys in our lives because we are created
1861.11,1869.27, you mentioning about when you have a bad day does is it in your former therapy absolutely
1869.27,1872.51, is absolutely my former therapy
1873.14,1881.24, i just think music of all different types and ministers i prefer to certain i don't but i feel music should provide a message
1881.42,1886.4, and that message could mean taking the banditry in around
1887.0,1890.81, example just to throw out i do
1890.81,1902.33, nursing home nursing facility and broken my mother's in the isolation etherealist few years and i go in there and there's a lot of people that are not having a really great day and the sad they're not feeling well and
1902.33,1948.23, putting on something to change that made for them and making them you know daneland everything so i definitely agree that it's therapy for me and it's therefor a lot of people i do see pictorially doing that and it is amazing because many of the people that are in nursing homes have no one and for someone to come in and put some one to uplift someone spirit when they are anaxagoras conveniable back to a sense of reality so you are
1948.8,1955.16, like the double doctor doctor the doctor too in the house because it
1955.43,1957.83, to do that i know when
1957.86,1961.94, feeling down and
1962.0,1969.35, put a music to almy soul to be able to feel better as a person
1969.35,1973.37, journey in life is to
1973.94,1978.95, kind of go through the hills and valleys of
1979.22,2014.95, negative i would say and i think with all of us we had that i think as women we have three different tell me women here which make the life is and i want to say as a trans gender woman feels that type of the man i can go into the valleys of emotions about things that have happened to us go and then i can also be able to be that and to reach out to help some one else sometimes the strongest of us kept do that
2015.07,2075.82, sexual woman you know that that is so did you as a lesbian you know that so and so we have three empowering women here to day on the show which makes it so much different rather than just having three or maybe one type of sexuality it doesn't necessarily mean that that's a different but it means that we've all had our journeys in life and what we tend to achieve and we are not twenty years old so what happens what happens to the woman who might be reaching that age of forty what happens in life because i know with men if they hit the age of thirty and they haven't been able to achieve something it seems to be able to go down here for a while they seemed to have to feed the ego the know what happens with the woman when at dagefoerde we do when we have an achieved something like i know dignement one before
2076.09,2088.51, about being a suicide a certain age but you know what i believe is but a number and by your continued passion to be able to
2088.51,2094.21, to do something that you love that makes you a superstition many people give up
2095.38,2101.62, the passion and the sybil i should have i would have
2101.8,2106.39, but we do how do you feel about that elena
2106.42,2111.85, i completed a great is very hard
2112.45,2116.05, not to think of giving up this special
2116.23,2122.86, in certain estates in a certain time in your
2122.92,2127.36, by the said 
2129.46,2131.83, the river
2131.89,2147.34, want to give up right before in our right when he's getting the toughest the next that sanctuary achieve what you want something at umtongo exactly that
2147.34,2156.73, you might want exactly what do you feel about that the pesame way i mean i've done a lot of work on myself over the last
2157.27,2199.45, maybe years in stuff like that even doing the disc and you don't give up you know i realized that life is a journey you know the way i was wisconsin when i was younger was i was a straight students i felt like the way i knew i finished something but getting a piece of paper saying i finished it i realized and i won't say it's too late life he realized that in no life is a crayon inured to grow any volition i'm retreating myself you know people assume when you say djath have this whole stereo type of inclyta have a hundred women is going into garrets as a vent
2199.48,2200.62, i want to
2201.22,2214.87, at a memory for some money but i never give up i keep pushing speaking of music maybe it sounds it of corn but the barber striking song don't ride on my parents days around
2214.87,2243.67, athanasius me a little one to go into a toilet he detested you have made a favourite song that you mataswintha i like to add don't ever give but a long yourself to have bed that because you will have them oneself or for the head like i used to set
2243.76,2280.12, you know i do have a good day i didn't work for that coatuit or catherall happen and nonessential ever have in norandino just to add to that some of the most productive days are days i don't start out right you know the davit have planned the aim going to do this a going to do this in gottingen the city of to day there are lots of things i had planned they didn't go they didn't grow a friction but we knew that there was a plan too and that's what makes the strength in a person i think you know just being a woman remember
2280.36,2282.01, you are the
2282.79,2286.39, meat of the earth you the strength
2286.39,2309.43, behind many men and i think that that is so important and whether it's whether it is sexual and whether it is a lesbian with whether it's a trans gender woman we all feel the same feelings and emotions when we are cut we all bleed the same and that's what's so important that that's where the unity
2309.64,2329.89, and into action should happen especially in a time of crisis as we are to day and i see was going to talk about politics but i just want to say that one thing i will say we will fight we will resist we won't never ever give up
2330.07,2331.99, remember that
2332.02,2396.97, so important that is why we are here to day and we will out maneuver all of those who want to think of us as less than people but an torsonse your presenting of listening to certain aleutian when i write the alisander in paramus on i photograph oriental completely in our alloweth premeditated orontobates altimeter i was with i was actually listening to a capella version of my house it was it was an apathy was able to understand
2397.78,2405.13, kind of her energy and her song and her fears and her motions and her material
2405.13,2414.94, just listening to that song and i my good without all the band behind it to sitting in a room for the microphone and hearing a guanaco
2415.18,2448.72, i said to myself my god what an amazing talent who has gone too soon and mercury ignoble somehow we've had my goodness vermichel recently re just recently had the terrible terrible shape
2449.41,2468.22, what happens to people during this period in time it is important and a branching out to as we were talking earlier feeling good about ourselves and would bring people to that point where they feel that
2468.43,2469.9, they have money
2470.2,2471.55, nothing
2471.97,2479.23, keep them here that they are agony that they need to take their lives
2479.47,2485.71, how do you interpret that lina i mean just hearing about that and just your own opinion how do you interpret that
2485.83,2488.35, i think it's
2488.65,2489.52, he
2490.09,2493.54, so telling that goes waiting
2493.72,2497.38, a person i think in bills out
2498.7,2500.98, a long period of time
2501.76,2503.32, and
2503.35,2506.53, of course were especially as women we have to be
2507.64,2511.87, and we pushed the sitting down one way or
2511.99,2513.19, being pushed
2513.88,2517.54, put down i say sometimes i've
2517.54,2519.13, i
2519.19,2520.57, i think it's just
2521.62,2523.57, and it
2523.93,2527.02, i rose a self esteem
2527.08,2528.64, and
2531.55,2547.18, oh go to very difficult times and they can still be a survivor and then we have decimeter people who can't and feel that it's so important to and at this point i mean i talk very honestly that 
2547.24,2557.32, i went to a very deep depression being transcended to the point where i almost sideline my career
2557.47,2569.47, points of my life because i did want to be around anybody and i had to the andes point i had to say to myself you have to be yourself up
2570.04,2573.34, bring yourself out of it
2573.64,2575.11, and i was able to
2575.11,2585.64, don't say that you don't people that some depression on your hat these so that anybody know timanthes the sides and i know what to do now but there was a point in my life
2585.67,2587.89, where it terrified me
2588.16,2602.2, what was happening to my light what was going on and i and why was i feeling this way why was i so fearful and bringing them up now and seeing the entresol of
2602.26,2613.54, awful people the mind and within ourselves is so important an adorer in your own words did you mean when you were at your kind like loison oh
2613.69,2648.19, i very onerous you know i know the reader honest and i'm so lot of people don't know this about me but i do talk about it about the depression i went through in the nervous break down i went to kneisel out of it when i saw other people around me who couldn't so i just thank the great spirit the white was the point where you realize that you saliently i've had moments in a break down
2648.43,2660.64, but i you know characterized them of that i didn't know where to go what they would call you know and i used to act down to from way you know my temper with my fist you know but you know there was a time when
2660.91,2674.11, i know it's what put a word you know i was at really low point in my life and i mentioned years ago i had other things that happened but after the break up them that relationship i was devastated and nanari
2674.11,2678.37, had a dream i didn't want to work i don't want to think and
2678.37,2685.87, you know i read a lot and it wasn't just you know since a god might do i fraid to universe
2686.26,2690.37, you know i knew the woman i was and i wanted to
2690.67,2699.34, through that and i guess i just makes an amazing strength i was very wealthy i know many friends that of disappear i don't know where they're at
2699.43,2703.51, for things that have happened in life but you know i had
2704.11,2713.56, blessing that had the strong well i really believe you'll get this my grandmother she reshapes as with over me oh yes and i believe my grandmother had
2713.89,2722.71, me to get through this dark storm and then the idea of coming with music and the jane again to
2722.92,2739.42, something i enjoyed i do and i know it's something i can uplift people spirit so i was very lucky i guess you know you just think yourself and my beholders often is not easy now it's not easy but you keep pushing and i'm really
2739.48,2787.93, a really good place in my life you know i feel being here today on the show tormenting in between jobs as you know we retail you know this is amazing opportunity just another sign that i'm going to keep going after my treatment and i guess that's why i feel i feel my grandmother gave me the nut werther is the angel in your show who actually probably spiritually talked to my mother had made you know put the thought my head for you to be so she went to her again in your life i think it's the same thing we have anastacio protect me my grandpa is your grandparents and i do agree with you i reminded lit
2788.2,2790.21, so as 
2790.45,2794.23, healing as therapy
2794.56,2798.22, is that an it's not easy
2798.28,2804.97, is not instantaneous it takes time as sometimes this the program i think
2804.97,2807.58, sometimes we don't have
2807.64,2813.31, time because the pain that we feel one way or down
2814.03,2826.15, just way too much to remember those as he were depression herewith donatelli is so if you can take hold that
2828.19,2832.36, darkness pain frustration
2833.29,2834.7, else
2835.57,2882.73, and use it as a source of energy to create tarantellas in their dark energy and when you do it you releasing it to your photograph you really sing the dog energy did you name through your music i release it to performance and performance or not i do as well as this show i want to say this is so special for me to day to be able to do it because the many times people do not talk about the ashantees in the great light that their perfect what asperities
2883.12,2884.59, getting through
2885.1,2891.73, what we had to deal with in our lives that is so so important if we can empower
2892.0,2913.36, someone who's watching today on the show who maybe doesn't know where to turn because usually when you suffer with depression you really don't know where the thing you don't want to talk about it because you feel that people will label you this is the time when you need to be able to release
2913.39,2919.09, say that there is always somebody that is there to help you
2919.36,2920.59, again
2920.98,2949.42, and i think it's so important i think what's happening now even with offer lady in city new york reaching out and letting people know that there are places to go if you need help to please talk with some one there are many stories that go and publicized as far as people can suicide but the judge some goudge who was oh just took a walk and went into the hut simmer
2950.5,2969.88, if people thought there was a play but they actually said that she decided to commit suicide and here's a very mondement was appointed by some of the higher higher people and to hear that this murder woman a doctor of letters as a judge would just be able to feel that so frustrated
2970.36,2990.28, that she was able to take her own life because the inability to go forward that's where we need to have our sisterhood that's where we need to be able to come together because it seems like the more learned you are the more afraid that you ought to reach out to grass the heminent i'm not feeling well
2990.52,2994.03, this point because you afraid that her going to be
2995.14,2996.49, the
2996.73,3011.85, weak yet not strong enough to let well logicians nothing to lock about exactly exactly then i need to jump on her i totally agree you know that was a big thing asking for help
3012.12,3053.01, not such a dirty word was brought up a different way asking where to get the right help and also pursuing your dreams i have to say is a woman and we are three different types of one to stick together and appurtenances in the taj world nope don't want to every know if they can't do a party or they can't do something they don't let another do the way we are successful in the way we grow and i believe a woman and i have a lot of amazing man in my life you know brother and father is but we have to work twice as hard as tom
3053.22,3072.9, and put yourself out there and in trying to get the right answer or in power in somebody else and reaching and to some as just makes a stronger you know i want to add to that hadendowa we're talking about today and the fact of mentioning my director glory methodee with years
3073.29,3079.74, who actually gave me strength in many ways
3079.77,3101.52, an environment where it can be very competitive now gives me that strength i mean we always don't told very nicely but we taught strongly and now that we're in each other corners when it is important and so that's why i give her every day
3101.64,3116.64, whether she's busy or not to let her know because in my life that's what i did with my mother who was an inspiration to me during a period of time when you know being the openly transcend was not so much so
3116.64,3119.01, why i do believe that
3119.25,3121.41, reaching out
3122.7,3125.31, one another for the
3125.49,3128.49, to find his transition theirselves
3128.64,3133.26, and we find ourselves and we come
3133.41,3137.25, not to one end of the journey but we
3137.46,3138.84, i think we
3140.22,3142.35, really scout
3142.77,3152.04, what we want to do in our lives with our lives where we want to be what what does our purpose fashion dreaming
3152.28,3153.3, may it
3153.45,3166.23, i think it exciting it takes that tradition have this tionontates attact you know they're good resulted her in these to have this trottin every everything good
3166.5,3167.55, has
3168.03,3199.71, proposals i think i think image of our lives we all starting point yet the day before yesterday i went it was a conversation with some one and i had already said i was going to go to demonologists true to do terogloona
3199.8,3234.9, without any of those within without any of those afflictions but i have a lot of old so i was all concerned so i said well anselme know about this is oh no and he looked in he said and he told me but i need to gain that cortese was it was a sunset denial about going to a dermatitis for whatever reason and if i was going to go to joe tells who had the good to pick up something he won't cause evelyn that didn't have that to show bayonet
3235.05,3240.3, i do have to say that that was one of the things that i was dealing with
3240.3,3252.09, and how do i overcome an how do we overcome things in our lives that can be afflictions because we always seem you know as we were talking early or camera
3252.09,3255.48, a friend of ours who you know is going to something deeper
3255.66,3260.01, and being strong and so when we 
3260.28,3274.71, when we are going to things sometimes it's good to the outside of the box and say of this other person my goodness we're not dealing with that you know how can we maybe snap back or give back
3274.71,3301.08, exactly i really believe that's realestate we are blessed in all lives there is no shame that you know the great spirit is given more than what you can handle some people suffer more some people suffer less some people and struggle of the life financially while other people it's drownin their hands and they don't know what to do with her you know and insignia
3301.11,3306.63, make the most powerful people that we are here the most poplars are the ones that continue
3306.72,3309.48, so it is necessary stronger
3309.75,3312.51, he is in waverton her
3312.51,3314.25, as she had no body
3314.79,3317.37, and she said she was going to give up
3317.52,3318.87, so
3318.87,3349.32, that empowers it's amazing the power of women and what we all encapsulate i'm sure you will be spinning music way into the station one at a detested anything so
3349.62,3376.8, i do have to say at this point in between i show you'll be hearing some of dese mixes so that way you will get a chance to also feel vibration musicale to feel it before we went to wentilation
3376.98,3391.08, something that really is tame specially made for me the edge here and song called the shape of view and the reason why i did that is because we all come in different shapes and sizes
3391.38,3395.01, and there is a love for every one
3395.22,3405.96, there in our lives and with that we will be back right here on no boundaries across the press are empowerment show
3406.59,3482.61, swallowed the falaise edisonian make you come some place in willamilla shadow that surrounded the preaching you asked oenotheras growled
