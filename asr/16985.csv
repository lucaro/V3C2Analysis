0.03,46.5, such a long dance clip three minutes he keeps going welcome to resonate my name is josh marian i'm glad you here because we are in the second part of a four week series called react audaciously normal and here here with that means a daytime daring bold reckless means dancing for your friend patron senior high school class president when you didn't even have a dance cardiograph took a normal use every day ordinary of course i did that because i had the case in my walk and right there on me so when they say later napoleon dynamite did you actually have that figured out beforehand said no i just followed my heart
46.98,62.61, alan put it in i can dance i'm ready for this so audaciously normal is the point of that movie clipping here's why this is important for us because we finished easter and i say finished on purpose because a lot of times we act like we finished easter two weeks ago
62.64,98.61, at easter as an end instead of a great beginning for us but there was a time in human history when easter was a beginning for a group of people and because of what happened in the death burial resurrection of jesus you saw an audacious nor malice he take off in a group of people called the church and so that's what we're doing we're looking at the book of acts and how they reacted to the resurrection in some ways that we might call crazy and they would look back at us and say no as not crazy that's that's actually really normal the real quick are you you're mere from allen will you wave in me
98.7,122.79, very cool i welcome as there's a reason a point that out some of you here like i'm not a man for moment i am a mother can i participate yes i have something for you so students measures and am as the witness how many of you students at some point in your life heard this question raise your hand is answer yes and her your mom ask you this
123.0,127.98, jimmy jumped off the bridge then would you jump off the bridge
128.13,129.36, it
130.32,152.34, that many of you have a friend named jimmy and impressed by that if jimmy goes to the parties that mean you get to go to the party so that's pretty normal you may have heard that for a while growing up some ask you another question but how many of you ever heard from your parents be careful who you hang out with because those people influence you and you don't want to be around the wrong crowd if you heard that
152.4,190.86, okay any students had just came to school i remember when your parents are dropping you off they had that last conversation with you this said he be careful who you pick as your friends be careful who you hang out with because those people will influence you so be careful and who you hang out with and if you hear that on your way as your parents are on the way out a good okay so parents i want to say to you this evening of instincts annoyance by biblical and there's some great theology and that the book of proverbs as bad company create corrupt good character so if your mom and there you can look to your kid and say i told you so
191.49,197.49, and you can look to after that and say you should listen to me more often the guy on the stage said so
198.09,209.46, so we should listen to our parents more often because there is some truth in that and i would say this be careful who you're two or three or four best friends are because you will become them
210.15,231.96, be careful who you hang out with primarily because you will become very much like your two or three or four best friends so here's the sermon today when when we look at the book of acts if you ever bleatin turned to a chapter two i'm going to tell you a little bit of why this is important and why i bring up your mom what she told you on the way out of the house when you were younger
233.01,276.15, here's why i think we live in a culture we live in a culture that says you and i should be more concerned with whom we are then who we hang out with in other words you define you you decide who you are you do you i do me we would said this before it and as no one can define you you define yourself you are the identifier you are a trinity of me myself and i and you live in that all of the time that is incredibly western that is incredibly normal and we walk in this all of the time and we're going to look at a reaction to the resurrection accepter two and there's a picture in the book of acts this is you don't belong to you
276.75,291.42, you don't identify yourself based on yourself but there's a group of people that should identify is i think seventh grade science class when you would take a bull frog and drop him in a boiling water and you had drained jump out immediately
291.51,299.25, and then this other story take the same frog and put him into the warm water and you gradually turn up the heat on him
300.42,313.14, and if you're more but thinker you've already gone there right so is after a certain time he gets used to that water and you gradually turn the heat on him that frog will never jump out of the water but rather will die right there in the water
313.71,319.68, so culture is looking at us as individuals and there gradually turning the heat upon us
320.01,327.87, i want to indict us a little bit very lovingly we are addicted to connection and we are dying for community
328.08,343.23, we are addicted to approval and we are dying for identity we are addicted to the shallow and we are longing for the deep we go to starbuck to be around every one be put on three hundred dollar headphones i says every one leave me alone
343.41,348.36, really here but i'm here because i am lonely but don't talk to me
348.45,349.56, none of you
349.83,355.23, okay i have a great idea let's all get together in a party and last look at our phones the whole time
356.46,365.94, have you ever done that it's just me so we are this group of people he says i want to be together alone
366.18,382.95, i want to be with you and not with you by proxy i'll do community but don't talk to me and don't ask me i'm really doing because all of us have fine it's how are you fine how are you fine glad we talk see next week you'll be fine then too i'm sure
383.04,386.52, i'll be fine too luckily so we won't have to talk about anything
386.91,392.67, the culture is turning up the heat on us saying you define you
393.84,396.3, or look at an acceptor 
396.96,400.8, the starting of the group of people called the church
401.07,410.04, and the first time the word church is used in the scriptures as in peter and jesus or having a conversation and peter says food are jesus's who do you say that i am
410.7,438.21, peter looked back at jesus and he says i believe you're the son of god i believe you're the cry i believe that you're the one that's come into the world to save a soul and jesus looks back and peter and says blessed are you simon peter as god revealed that to you and on the profession of your what you just said in that profession on the foundation of that truth i will build my church my ecossais word in the greek and the notes of the first time i show of i will build my church
438.57,441.57, and the forces of darkness will never overcome
442.11,475.89, some translations have the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so the first time jesus talks about the church he says to peter what you just said i'm the christ on the lord that will be the very foundation of the church and no darkness will ever overcome this group of people that you guys are going to start a lasette one verse jesus let the apostles asses you will be my witnesses in jerusalem to daumartin of the earth i have saved you to send you and that has always been the strategy and then it actually starts to happen
475.95,485.82, preaches a sermon based on that same thing he told jesus jesus is the christ he is the son of god believe in him repent and listened it works
486.69,494.16, holy spirit shows up and people become believers in christ in an acceptor to you get another story
495.18,504.99, tell our culture though its turning to heroine's this other story that were invited into the way way way back when men and women started living in community
505.23,507.06, no comrade
507.3,509.7, those people change the history of the world
509.91,514.89, so accept or two of you they are retook at were forty two and it's going to be on the screen
515.55,518.88, but accepted two verse forty two says this
519.57,563.64, they are two words in i've got to stop and they devoted themselves but who in the world is that if you have actual copies scripture look to your left a chapter two verse eight is as all of these people were here from all different countries in all different languages and they were the parthians in the institution rosaleen to twenty different nation groups represented here they are there when peter preached that sermon and they become the believers so an acceptor two verse forty two and they
563.76,580.95, devoted themselves were talking about a group of people who primarily had no connection point before verse to the forty two there were these varying groups of people from all different nations and all different backgrounds and all different understandings of the world in verse forty two and says and they
581.58,609.57, devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching and to fellowship into the breaking of bread and the prayers and all came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles and all who believed words together and had all things in common and they were selling their possessions and belongings in distributing them in distributing the proceeds to all as any had need and day by day a tenant temple together in breaking bread in their homes
609.84,622.26, receive their food with glad in generous hearts praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved
622.44,656.1, so something happens and accept or to post resurrection that officially affects everyone and before we get into the breakdown of what that means we've got to start way up high and say what in the world happened to these people that affected them so much that they started to live life together and a very very powerful way and here's what i got to say first the first thing that you see an acceptor too is that this picture of vague they were a group of people that primarily understood their identity was not i define me but rather christine me
656.22,695.07, so the first thing an accepted to that you see from bertillon is there's a group of people that began to identify themselves primarily as men and women in christ not menemen from this country or from this background of from this socioeconomic status or from this job from this family group they began to identify themselves as men and women in christ that they were connected by a connection with jesus and everything else did not matter because their primary connection was in christ and so here's why i'm going to press this on you because there's an understanding in our world
695.52,698.16, but what it means to be a part of the church
698.22,719.28, and there's an understanding in our world a says i became a christian and then maybe i go to church as a support group similar to a person whose struggles with alcoholism goes to a as a support group sort really need the church i just go to the church as a support group to kind of add on to my many good things i'm doing in my moral life
719.4,724.2, last week we said you didn't just get saved to just go to heaven to just be moral
724.68,731.79, and so you look at this picture and it's even becoming trendy in our culture to say yeah i like jesus but i don't like the church
731.82,737.67, i love cry i love being in christ but i don't want to be in the church
738.06,744.81, and the troubling picture of that is that christ is married is the bride is his church
745.32,774.9, so i have a bride name amy and i love her and scripture tells me that should give my life for her an that's what christ did for his bride esthetic what it means to be married jesus in the church me and amy that's a beautiful thing to be similar to you say manolo you you are awesome your incredible on bound you all the time nothing compares to hanging out with you but he could you never bring me round she is a hypocritical awful person and i hate her
777.39,784.05, weird if that point because i would have to say to you i don't think you know me and you certainly don't love me
784.62,788.25, you can't say you love me and i am just doesn't work that way
788.7,812.64, all too often we go yeah i'm in christ but i can't be in the church because i don't like the church and listen i get it there's some times with the church has been harsh and we need to fix some of that and we need to be more loving and some places where we've been judged mental but in general you can't say i've been in christ but i don't want to hear the rest of your sermon just like the incisor we get the in crisp in all the rest of this is deeply connected us being in christ
813.24,817.26, here's the view of culture we have a slide that i'm going to show you
817.5,853.35, you and i are men and women do like he's kind of like hester young professional with the boat ties and suspenders very cool it so so i am a person who juggles many things in my life such as my schedule my money my social life a thing on the right we're going to pretend that a church it's a tenderloin without stetson the far left you see coffee dates and hang out times and so i'm a person that juggles these things and if we're not careful from time to time the pressures of life will overwhelm us and something that were juggling has to go by the way side
853.89,871.47, something that were juggling in our busy lives because we have classes and we have schedules and we have families stuff going on we are someone gets pregnant or someone loses the job or someone get sick and need something we say i'm juggling all these things in me but my primary identity is me and all this stuff i juggle can all go away
872.01,876.66, the scary thing about that is a lot of times we as church to the things that we juggle
877.14,882.96, there's this other picture that i want you to see and this is where we've got to start we're going to move forward in this
883.44,928.86, and look you see the gun the left super hister right there he kind of looks homeless but that's part of the thing that hipsters are going forwards like i look homeless and a pull out of macbean then i'm like oh you're not homeless you hister okay so this this understanding is it i do not live at the center of my universe i have a community that i live live with and they are primary to me so i cannot juggle all of these other things so now is pretended that's not a church any more that's a job and everybody in the center is the church and so all these things that i juggernauting that are primary to me what is primary to me is my community so we understand this this is point number one if you're taking notes that by becoming a christian
929.34,931.17, i belong to god
931.41,933.96, i belong to my brothers and sisters in christ
934.14,938.46, and accepted to the primary understandings that i belong to god
938.7,941.61, i belong to my brothers and sisters in christ
941.91,944.88, verse and accept or two says
945.54,950.1, and all that who were believed they were together and they had many things in common
950.19,979.65, so we if we see church as us things that we juggle were never going to get the picture of the mandate sheesha for us as we move forward so in light of that if we are in christ and we can't say we're not in community so step on his i am in christ and i am in community so i belong to god and i belong to my brothers and sisters in christ if we believe that there's three things that that affects for us a number one that affects based on bereft for is that affects our decisions
980.31,983.22, taking notes christians
983.55,989.43, decisions with regard to god and to the community
991.44,997.83, verse says we are in christ we who are many we form one body
997.86,1000.8, and each member belonged to all the others
1001.55,1038.45, the first century church understood this they were in christ and they were in community and they had to make decisions with regard to the community similar to how a husband makes decisions with regard to the family that he loves and cares about is in communion in connection with so we make decisions based on one another andernach the lives there an invitation into each other's homes there's an invitation to say he come and be near to me and let's figure out this thing together
1038.48,1044.63, so what does that mean for us how do we practically walk through this here's what this means
1045.26,1047.75, there need to be people in your life
1047.87,1050.09, who know who you want to be
1050.39,1069.95, there need to be people in your life men there need to be men around you in your life for you have told them the vision that you have for your life you do not have a vision for your life you need men to get together round you and say he can you help me figure out a vision for my life women you need to be around women who you know that they know who you want to be
1070.64,1084.29, they can tell you back hey here's what you told me you want to be and then that's not enough that's just step on secondly you have given them expressed permission and consent to hold you to who you want to be
1085.13,1091.58, your decisions in life are not made and isolation were you yourself and i get together and figure this thing out
1091.82,1109.94, rather you have men and women in your life who make decisions together so there is an aspect of this that is incredibly encouraging that there are people in your life this speak for you and encourage you and sounds were your completely down and out and you're not being where you want to be and there's this other side of that where there's an intrusiveness to it
1110.72,1118.55, and men and women into your life minutemen had come against you lovingly when they know that you're not being who you want to be
1119.72,1123.95, so when i talk about decisions in other words you should never buy a house and isolation
1124.28,1155.57, should have been a come around to go ahead as this a good deal hey how's this house going to help me further the gospel he how's the community in our church going to be able to get around this house and have parties women when you have situations in your life come up you should never make decisions on how to do this or how to do that and isolation you notice i don't have any illustrations for women i'm like what i got i don't know women get together with other acescent this and invite people into the decisions that i have in front of me
1156.41,1159.05, no no there's some harshness to the 
1159.41,1165.11, there's some aspects of this that say when you're down and out i want to pull you back into community
1165.59,1183.26, when people miss my village to times in a row or calling them were pulling them back into community were encouraging them were saying hey come back come back and there's this other aspect of the people are intentionally running from community that we are able to lovingly go after them and grab him and said he that's not you want to be
1184.22,1194.0, but we talked about this so so in some ways i am able to speak into your life with boldness and truth just like christ word because i've prayed for you
1194.3,1215.18, and i wept with you over that and i rejoice with you when you won that and i submitted to you that i would walk with you through this whole process so i might of all of that relationship all of the connection we have i'm going to lovingly judge you and tell you that's not what you want to be so come back into the community and i invited you to do that to me
1215.66,1219.23, book of proverbs as faithful as the wounds of a brother
1220.13,1226.94, hateful as the wounds of a brig the faithful as it when that man says i love you too much to let you go down that road
1227.93,1246.17, college i had minimized who i told them well wanted to be and he told me who they wanted to be and we were dreaming about the men got on as to be onto be men of character and be men of purity and to be men who loves or future wives well on to all this stuff and in two thousand three two thousand for this is the dawn of the laptop era
1246.65,1256.64, before the year your computer lived in your room and you couldn't like move it without employing stuff and bring in a backpack or two to move this thing
1256.82,1267.65, and the box was huge in the screen was tiny and so in we have laptop and i'm living with these four other men who are my brothers in the faith is the equivalent of an ethos group and resonate church
1268.37,1277.01, we want to grow in our faith and we want to become godly man and we don't really know how to do this so we're just trying to figure this out so we say we're going to memorize a verse
1277.28,1306.95, monday we get together and we would say okay what verse were going to memorize and we put it on the index card and i would carry that card around with me everywhere so if you ran into me waiting in a line that junior senior year of college i would have had an index card reading he said what are you reading and maybe he intermittent
1307.1,1319.25, not healthy things not going to help your godly character kind of things things that are not going to help you love your future wife will so in light of all this stuff you could not in our apartment sleep with your laptop in your bedroom
1319.94,1331.7, had to be on the kitchen table when you went to bed and if you went to bed with your lodowick on the door and said he give us your laptop and you said i have home work and we said you do your home work at the kitten table
1332.42,1341.99, cause i don't want that for once you to be tempted by that and you soon you may say that sounds like rules just to ichabod i don't care i needed it
1342.41,1353.81, one i was walking around with a note card and my my loftus on the kitchen table because i had some dreams from my future and i had brothers in my life he said he i want to fight for you not with you
1354.92,1356.6, for
1356.84,1359.27, so there should be people in your life
1359.57,1362.09, able to fight for you not with you
1362.66,1368.15, some of this may feel like okay well josh you're coming out but i submit to you that you desire this
1368.42,1380.9, smith all of you really do want this in your life there is a term that's come up and i think this is hilarious and i hope you do too but there's a term has come up for face book there's a term called vague booking
1380.9,1386.06, which means i post vague things on face book have you heard of this
1386.09,1388.13, i will give you some illustrations
1389.24,1393.11, i don't know why i even try
1393.95,1396.59, i'm wondering if it's all worth it
1396.98,1409.88, hugh exclamation point i really should have known better why i always feel these feelings
1410.18,1417.92, well now i know who my true friends are so your vague looking right
1418.13,1429.8, you've got to call your friend jim and go jimmy while you vague looking but he doesn't pick up the phone so you text jimmy and you say jimmy why are you big booking and he sends you back a frown face emotion
1429.98,1438.8, really jimmy who jumped off a bridge together you're going to do this to me
1440.33,1459.05, vague looking because you want some one to care because your longing for some one to call your text you or post on their hewet's going on even though you're not going to tell them you just want to know that somebody loves you you are intrinsically wire by a god who loves you to want to be loved
1459.05,1468.41, there's no doubt about this you were created for community your created to be in christ created to be in community and you long for that
1468.74,1485.99, and so every time you don't do that it's difficult because you want it and so then you vague book if you're not laughing your vague booker stop we know who you are we're friends we try to hide your time like cause your depressing
1487.73,1491.48, but we've called then we tried we take you allison
1491.63,1494.63, everybody hates voice mais fine
1495.17,1515.57, so decisions are significant part of people who live in crying community you need those people in your life you need those senior life this is significant for us secondly when you start living this south what's going to happen is the way you view possessions changes in verse they sold their possessions and belongings and they distributed them to those who had need
1516.11,1523.88, a crazy big bible verse that we can breeze right over but the scripture just said people sold stuff
1523.88,1526.49, because other people had need
1526.88,1544.34, so and so has a need i'll sell something get the money and bring it to them because no one has need in this community whose in christ and community so there is an understanding of this the christians value community over possessions
1546.38,1549.8, generosity says i have an i give
1550.07,1553.82, community says we have so you can have
1555.23,1566.15, in the new testament these words go back and forth it would say they would take up offerings not as an act of generosity but they would take up offerings as an act of community
1566.21,1581.87, as an act of coin and near is the new testament word for this they did this all of the time in the first century they realized that everything they had was from god therefore giving it away was not hard because it was from god that was never there in the first place
1582.32,1586.13, james as every good and perfect gift comes from the father above
1587.27,1590.9, this man's friends that we are entitled to nothing
1591.47,1600.56, we deserve nothing the we have earned nothing the truth is in this may sound harsh but we deserve to die yesterday
1601.04,1611.03, he by the grace of god who are alive to day and breathing and god has invited us to live out his story to day you say well i have a job and i work hard to which i say you have breath because god gave you breath
1611.72,1618.2, nobody that works and a mind the words because god gave you the stuff we're entitled to nothing but we were born in titled
1619.34,1633.8, parents who are here how many of you ever when you had a young kid a five or under how many of you mums ever ran up to dead pulled something away from him that he had bit him on the arm and yelled mine that's mine
1636.23,1642.62, many of you have seen the three year old come up to grab something from you by you on the arm and you mine
1642.98,1644.6, to learn that
1644.84,1653.51, to teach them that no one modeled that to them they came out yelling mine because all of us are entitled
1654.92,1658.22, becoming a christian means that we kill entitlements
1659.39,1667.04, and the beautiful picture this an we start to live this stuff out and scripture this is not a mandate for a isolde joyful for us
1667.13,1677.12, later talks about this and securities he says each man and woman should give out of the overflow of their heart and it should be a joyful cheerful thing to be generous
1677.27,1686.78, to be joyful cheerful thing to have a group of people that you serve in love with your possessions that's why we call them joy boxes in the back case you were under
1686.99,1712.55, should be your joy to say this isn't mine anyway it's on loan i'm just starting it so god take back lasalle years and i would love to worship you more but being more generous it's always intended to be that way and i submit to you that the book of acts chapter two and this one specific thing the way they viewed each other in possessions was the reason by which they stood out in culture like stars in the night
1713.27,1727.19, this group of people because of the way they took care of each other because of the immense amount of love that they had they gave away their possessions that gave away so much and sold stuff to give away more stuff this made them stand out like nothing else
1727.91,1733.34, and it's challenging to me because i wonder sometimes do we stand out like they stood out
1734.48,1737.33, the church was always intended to stand up
1737.72,1746.0, primary way to stand out in a generation of me my entitlement i can have the shiny things is to live as a group of people that don't function like that
1746.39,1749.21, i read you a quote by gum john piper
1749.6,1751.58, and he says the silent screen
1752.24,1764.03, as churches are dying to day because they are not doing anything which the world should look at and say this is evidence the god is real and that he is glorious
1764.99,1781.76, many churches have forgotten why they exist namely to do good deeds in the name of jesus so that people will be moved to give god glory all of the selling of the possessed all these actions always turned into giving god boy which reminds me of something jesus said
1782.69,1787.37, live out these good deeds and men and women will look at that and i will praise your father and have
1787.88,1800.9, so when at church starts to forget that it exists for others and for god had become ingrown and self satisfying making go on you after year like a social club with a religious veneer but it's life is ebbing away
1801.32,1812.42, people are no longer saying look at all their good deeds and their humble spirit in which they have done all these things their god must be a glorious god of encouragement
1813.41,1833.24, i was supposed to look in on us and see evidence of something other worldly their supposed to say that type of community does not exist here and incredibly intrigued by that type of community those type of possessions should lead us to to make people wonder what we are doing and why we are like who we are like
1833.63,1835.52, so we are in christ
1835.67,1839.3, in community and we are in culture
1839.54,1850.19, toast point which is the point of angels severity seven of his texas people were added to their number every single day
1850.88,1872.51, so they read together they share their possessions they made decisions together they took care of each other and in light of all that that same grouping people were saved daily people were believing daily so christians if you're still taking notes christians share the gospel in a community
1872.69,1893.78, where the gospel is being shown christian share the gospel in a community where the gospel is being shown another slide for us ready for this this side shows a rope that has three different strands of rope and primarily speaking we have used this middle strand of rope were to share the gospel and a lot of times this has been done and isolation
1893.87,1913.31, and i'm not saying this is broken but i am saying it's incomplete so that we go out into the world and we say i'm going to share the gospel with some one cold turkey and isolation which we should do that but that's the only thing i'm ever going to do is just go and do that when when a lot of time some of you who are nervous about sharing the gospel i want to relieve some pressure here today
1913.43,1917.72, you live in christ and you live in community and you live in culture
1918.62,1925.13, in the gospel no longer turns into hay if you were to die right now would you go to heaven or hell person i don't even know your last name
1925.73,1930.47, rather turns into he would you ever want to hang out with me and my friends
1931.31,1938.57, books briscoe in here every day i don't know what you do on thursday nights but the only thing to do in pullmans this place called ze
1939.17,1956.33, and if i had any easterby would but that's the only place i can go so not casino area of zeppa's but bowling in arcades you're into so hey starbuck's brissotins on mine and i we're going to go to zion we're going to go bowling which everyone to do that
1958.16,1966.65, them into this building relationship world that you've already done and you invite them into a community
1966.95,1970.67, to you people have rejected the gospel word
1971.09,1974.03, gospel presentation has been rejected
1974.15,1978.62, because they have never been exposed to a credible gospel community
1978.77,1985.01, he rejected the gospel word because they look at you and say i've never seen that played out so no thanks
1985.91,2007.48, there are people in your life or you shared your sort of building relationships with them and they have expressed non interest they have expressed a little bit of adversity to that i submit to you if you invite them into a community of people that love each other and say care of each other and they see that that there is no greater weapon in all the world than inviting some one in sir community
2008.56,2013.69, bet you people will fall in love with the christian community before they fall in love with the christian god
2014.35,2016.99, i believe that god said it up that way
2017.17,2025.21, for far too long we have lived under this code of if you want to be a christian hero the rules rule number one behave first
2026.23,2049.03, can it up ruler one of you on and his behaviour to believe everything i about to tell you don't question anything so act right the gospel of don't don't do this don't it is don't ohitika that together then believe everything in about to tell you and then next if all that words you can belong which by the way is bordering
2049.99,2057.37, if you don't behave the way we say i believe the way we say then you never get to be in that is coltish
2057.4,2063.58, the primarily we exclude people instead of include people which by the way has nothing to do with jesus
2064.69,2086.77, if this starts to work and we are in christ in community and the culture influencing the culture and that's primarily are identity there were in christinot in culture and that's our identity that buttoned
2087.58,2109.06, why don't you come and hang out with us why do you be introduced to a network of relationships of these people who love each other recklessly give to each other generously as an act of community make decisions together and we look other worldly sanco into that and belong to us and hang out with us and if that works i believe that people will start believing
2109.9,2118.21, they belong they will believe and trust me if they belong and they believe something internally will change and their entire behavior patterns will change
2118.72,2123.43, for this and say i have friends that go to ze
2124.39,2142.63, and you should come hang out with us and after they hang out with you here's the trick you ready for this this is what we've got to be we've got to be straight with each other we can't just go to ze pos we can't just watch the movies we can't just go hang out we have to be a group of people naturally intrinsically
2143.53,2148.48, when you invite them into the community they're going to hear god talk and it's going to be normal talk
2149.47,2165.07, at some point they get interested in that and we can explain to them the gospel and we explained to them the good news about jesus and the context of community that's living out the story of jesus we can't just speak it we have to show it these people understood that
2165.91,2172.45, we have got to invite people to believe by inviting them to belong
2173.65,2184.45, so here i want to close i want to say you're in christ as your primary identity in community and you've been invited to be in culture influencing culture and that's your identity
2184.99,2187.87, we did this and that's going to affect how we live
2189.04,2192.73, i i want to say that all of us have seen the discovery channel
2193.39,2206.92, in shark weak or tiger week or any other big cat week they have on discovery channel all of which i love dearly by the way and every episode starts like this it's that one sea lions by himself
2208.9,2217.12, and the music sir aches and all a sudden you see the fin and i grabbed the remote and go ahead and turn up the volume as this is about to get awesome
2217.72,2256.54, or if it had other week in that one gazelle hanging out on the tree when everyone else is ran off and you're like it won't be long till i see the tail of there he is there's the lion and again you turn it up and you can stand up and get closer the t but but what happens in this its people and isolation the sea line and isolation the gazelle and isolation is the very one that the enemy goes at an attack and kill and that is the picture in chapter two that we are never meant to be an isolation because those in isolation are attacked and accused and overtaken and devoured
2257.35,2262.78, never sent people out one at a time he said them out two by two heads we guys that hang out with
2264.4,2268.6, there's an urgency to this message because there's an immense danger if you don't believe it
2269.74,2276.58, the time we miss of this as we were looking at you now we have three weeks of the school and many of you are going to be gone for the summer
2277.3,2284.05, in the last six years of being a past to resonate church i've seen so many students come back from the summer jaded
2284.56,2287.92, pathetic and filled with regret
2288.31,2298.18, because they went off for the summer like the gazelle under the tree by themselves they went off in the summer like the sea line by themselves and they had no connection to community
2299.62,2305.92, and so we want this for you because there need to be men and women in your life who know who you want to be and they will fight for you
2306.85,2313.45, they will look at the enemy who's coming at you and say you're not going to be able to get close enough cause there's a lot of us
2314.71,2319.18, we want to invite you into a community and to know we want you to be known
2319.93,2329.8, we said from the outset that resonance is okay it's not be okay so come on in with all of us the only other thing about that is we're going to invite you not to stay where you are
2330.25,2333.25, that's okay it's just not okay to stay there
2334.48,2336.01, all broken
2336.16,2338.86, struggling as do that together
2339.34,2342.7, if we do that well there will be a beautiful story of that
2342.85,2345.55, making its way all throughout the northwest
2346.24,2390.13, we do not want to send students to ellensburg to plant worship services where they sing songs would not want to send students to missoula to go find avenue to gather every one and put a cool lights we want to send communities of people living out the gospel in the context of inanition i'm an inculte i'm in culture that's my identity and in light of that let's send those groups of people all over the northwest lessons people to tonsberg and somoza and stevenson hall on campus and greek houses let sin gathered church people all throughout the city because that's the strategy got saved you to send you and that was always the strategy will he sends you as a community
2390.34,2399.82, a week seven was incredibly lacking in that regard the you are not sent to be lone ranger here you were sent to be in community because as the greatest weapon of the church
2400.42,2406.09, we stand together and the world looks at us and says you guys are different i entreat
2407.11,2413.62, so the evening the responses as the band comes out as we want to invite you guys specifically guys that are leaving for the summer
2413.92,2415.78, there's a board in the back

2463.6,2476.74, for the rest of you who are here i want and want you to know that if you're going to be here this summer this is our community service the summer is a time were even some of us who live here we just say i'm going to call a big time out from the god that i'm juggling
2476.74,2642.61, i will accept it uses is not possible our community in your entries and that's her identity she don't get to call the time out so you to ask yourself are you in community are you able to invite people into your lives or or do you do not even know people to invite or some of you sitting here this evening say a man i'm the gazelle by themselves and i think i'm the sea lion all by himself i want you know that thou god wants for you i believe i bestow you want for you and so that means to night you ride on a connection cardhaven those grow pale i love a village that step on but that step you've got to initiate that i'm a pretty awkward guy and i could introduce myself impressure myself into a conversation but in general you got to take that step harrison's always going to be the back of the head church for you come in and look at some one's back of the head newland's fine for a little while but ultimately that's going to lead to you being pursued and devoured and we hate that for you god hates them for you we've always compassionate about community so we invited that cicadae for reaching the world is more gospel centered communities all over the northwest alliterative teutonically throstlethwaite and she
