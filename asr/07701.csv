20.22,32.94, i 
41.13,45.18, was born in brooklyn new york by two parents who were not new yorkers
45.18,77.67, and have a childhood where i was taken to a lot of theatre and dance and music and museums and in that time my kind of earliest memory of photography and my interest in it was a real landscape is and on the back of one of the boxes of tissues was a coupon for a polaroid camera
77.67,97.47, and so since i had been blowing my nose and less way for what seemed days on an i then cut out all of the coupons and put them in an envelope and sent off for my polar i came so that was the first camera but we had cameron the house that was my own personal camera
97.65,104.07, he 
105.24,109.53, in growing up in queens nor 
109.83,114.06, to the high school of art and design so very early on 
114.81,126.51, choices in what seemed at the time very arbitrarily to pursue art getting out of high school at disentery natural to me to go to 
126.51,134.13, a college which was a school of visual as
134.25,140.88, then i had to take as an elected as one of the courses photography and i found myself in the dark room
141.0,154.95, for fifteen hours a day without demand just learning the material going on the street and shooting so i quickly realized you know your heart is where you spend your time
154.95,170.34, going to california was interesting because it was a completely different environment for me intellectually this more conceptual school it was a perfect environment for this kind of
170.4,172.65, taking a break and thinking about what
172.68,190.14, be my relationship to my work because i was not interested in so much in performing myself but i was interested in this kind of story telling and kind of all these different motive me a chance to think about the mechanics of story telling or film making when the mechanics of
190.74,193.05, thinking about audience
193.11,195.66, and subject
196.41,210.66, for many different reasons prefer to be back in new york another friend who is also a curator and minor kelly jones tell me all you know your back that great
211.02,219.51, working at this start up small private museum it just has offices right now and
219.81,222.66, we need a reception is which you 
222.87,226.86, i sure and i need a job and back and
227.13,240.21, i got the job as receptionist because it was in a lost i would use the office as a studio so i actually shot water at that office at night
240.63,251.46, for me barbara is about kind of memory but then the value of memory and in its subjectivity its value a value of being recognized or dismissed
253.86,265.65, the early photographs of from the eighties until about
265.71,267.87, early 
267.96,328.68, eliminate the face it's a portrait but who is the subject becomes a question and then for that matter what is the intention of the photographer what the text kind of either support or take away a different position of what you might expect living in brooklyn at that particular time for two blocks every other shop was a weak shop and it was a way of a kind of making a departure from the work that i had made before still using an element that is an identification in terms of appearance one might choose to wear their hair or to wear a wig or to assume an identity or to invent an identity for oneself becomes kind of the undercurrent of that particular ties
328.68,361.5, the adult in terms of printing an image on it either through lithography or silk screening had this different quality to a kind of transformed the photograph that image into something that was much softer and felt more like a drawing the pottering because their base on images from the nineteen twenties up into the seventeenth in
361.89,366.18, portraits where people are kind of mimicking and
366.48,384.78, in themselves for the cab on foot i came across one image of a woman who was leaning against a car she took on to learn how to pose in front of the camera i thought this is really interesting in mental bought it on a bay and
385.08,398.64, immediately after purchasing it the sellers of the meal i well i had this collection of images i don't know who the systems like we have like about or sometimes of the woman are you interested in purchasing it
399.03,403.35, absolutely and so i purchased them and
403.38,445.98, myself well what would i do with them what would be interesting about this and for me i was too kind of present and expand her project by me taking on her character and mimicking her and there's also a man who also appears in the project as a photographer so i also imitate him so at first in looking at you know all these images on all you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell the different kind of after while see that i am in it mimicking them 
445.98,466.35, so to cap that project off there are two images where the male and female character playing chess they don't appear together in a shop playing with one another so i took that as i wanted to make a video of them playing chess in the way what's interesting about the reflections is that they are not symmetrical
466.53,495.27, at first glance it seems like it could be five different people sort somewhat dress similarly but is confusing because in reflections i think it will we view them we assume some kind of cemetery in terms of the positions of each individual is not like a whole hitchcock hall of mirrors where the images repeated symmetrically infinitely their five different images that are slightly different from one another
495.66,514.32, when the same position as the characters we put a hand baby grand piano in sequences that was within chest is an improvised performance by jason in that moment for the piece
