0.03,38.61, the urban as anger is important for affordable several reasons first it's an opportunity to show case some of the incredible opportunities in talent we have here at fort we have faculty that right and teach in a variety of areas related to urban law we have three great clinics that work on urban legal issues we have the only student run urban lorna in the country and its approaching its fortieth anniversary this spring we have a great relationship with a wonderful urban studies program at fournier and of course were grounded as we always have been at foremost in the life of the city so it's an opportunity to advance
38.61,47.4, and a dialogue about the nature of urban law it's an opportunity for our students to be engaged in question that they'll encounter throughout their career
47.4,54.15, an opportunity to have an impact on some of the most important issues facing cities around the country and around the world
54.54,59.04, leatrim ary goals the first is a scholarly goal
59.22,84.45, feel the urban mob was well recognized decades ago but for variety of interesting reasons we don't as legal scholars tend to talk about urban law as a unified field any more in other areas of the academy in economics and sociology in history in political science they are very well recognized subspecies that focus on or anenomes are bestially urban history or impolitic
84.57,125.1, that kind of focus in sub specialty deserves to be a part of legal academy and i think that the urban legal law enter can help it vance that that specialty second i think we have an important role to play in advancing the engagement of students with the question of how long shapes the life of cities are students are going to be involved in legal questions throughout their career that involved the built environment and land use and sustainable and social justice and fairness and equity questions that are the heart of how cities operate and how people live in cities and helping them see that helping them engage with those questions is an important goal of the centre third
125.37,150.12, i think that the urban low center can help advance a policy dialogue in an area where the role of law is not given as much attention as it could be there's a very very important legal questions at the heart of most urban governance issues again whether it's the built environment the role of sustain ability questions of fairness and equity in all of these areas that are the cutting edge of urban governance
150.33,160.56, law plays an important and under recognized role and i think the urban lower complaint important role in surfacing those questions and helping policy makers think more deeply about them
160.95,193.98, things in most excited about in terms of the potential of the urban low anger is how we can help students engaged with a variety of legal questions at the intersection of law and cities so we are already working with students to try and find placements an extrinsic where encouraging students to get involved in clinics we have three great clinics that involve urban legal questions we are starting a practitioner series where we're going to help students find mentors and understand carpathian law and i think the potential for student engagement could not be better
