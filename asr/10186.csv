105.54,109.05, when the lease ran upon that they 
109.11,118.53, then if the marriage which is why i wanted one i can fast and far in maironi once which was really there great time for chambardeau he was really kind of

130.74,137.67, it was quite difficult to find the place in city that was a formidable and that sobrante to do with the project
137.76,160.98, i found the place where cornelia summer spoke lustreless there the first bodenwerder in ten balearic is to set guarantee in the northeast in a city of a whereby five months for a country where sharpened
161.13,173.16, but the woman the difference is the way things he don't answer that it is the space that people can use for basically any kind of social political cultural activity
173.28,190.71, but it's a space that's managed a democratically by collective where has an equal saying and it's not wrong in order to generate profit like percent of the places in the city in its rallentando respond to our people 
190.83,192.6, a people
194.01,204.84, so we organized so the building is basically wrong by electioneering to kind of talk about one inhabitant to make sure the building esterote
204.87,212.82, spaciousness and business types creation have social space after all were more social creatures than

243.81,247.98, i'm just trying to get involved in whatever solace
247.98,261.24, one of the most important things and i tristesse which i to facility in different poseidonia matter what the background gander or sectarian
261.36,280.56, i pitillo to some extent we tried we into disappearing in a party political stuff in it i want to be grassroots fast and work on an old hiatuses wherein the art and there i like to set off on
280.56,294.3, because i have pretty much almost every day in considerate and i like settin the yard quite often because i like is really hope to find there a space in the city where you have like somewhat sit face
294.6,301.26, we spend like my renine months trying to find the perfect goldenheart
301.47,304.35, so here we have a space we're going to
304.35,327.57, into a garden and they have some space for economies we favour projects the mongolian trying to get a bite the ground is bifurcated routine and artificialities share and probably some rearranges relates he shall morehouse
327.69,338.43, a place which is successful here in space of causerie or for a small donation and i cannot encourage community groups and
338.64,341.55, of the famous of people who want to have
341.88,358.14, at the sitting basinette the love amanuenses bordering the price of basilides very inspiring because when you're working with people
358.17,359.76, because
359.76,360.87, have
361.02,367.89, you know you have a similar ideas and visiteth way things should be done
368.01,375.06, you're working for people to some the basis of a kind of solidarity and a collective winicapora where everybody can find
375.33,380.07, and when that works well is very environment
380.16,391.02, by its very frustrated her sombre as the safest policy as an acknowledgement of the kind of you know so the problem that exist in society and an secondly it like
391.35,409.77, kind of like a statement that the sort of drugs attention to some of his behavior and to say that actually we're trying to create a space where we estimate people to think about these kind of things think about how you pay imparter people you know to be aware of other people's kind of indolence
409.89,434.58, and you know just to kind of acknowledgment of the fact that like people are really different and can experience things were differently so you know kind of the earth people to be sensitive towards each other if we pitterpat
434.61,436.26, others a number 
437.73,442.65, in capability to be something more in different right now is like so
442.68,449.4, together to provide the one a man aspects of shortbread a autonomously
450.24,464.01, i quite decline sir like doubling because every space indolently granted at the market value which is very high and times we have to pay quite a significant side rent
464.04,499.77, for the way were dictated by a raise that money for the rent that i am shambrywa actually just for the cafe and then is ready a dustlike mentioned amazing and it was only into the reason he get more about iridescence torso just such a positive thing and like saying as such supportive oriente for things are outdistance when
499.92,509.34, as columbia and calcutta has been long affair kid space saturating the kid in and like a
509.43,534.6, he said and here we have a table to his table the teleostei very lax into the main gobiernistas of tone have been basely mainly colourists action but complaining repexam les were beseeched
534.6,542.79, there's a new italian getting ready to mascotte our
542.85,582.36, and there has been the work of a danish man around and a revolutionist will be part of raratonga and our felicitas off a new grapefruit which is like an initiative for sort of queer alternative space and for days lesbians with sexual queer is transcended the whole spectrum of identity and who want to see alternative sort of social events activities and discussion faces simitars of activities with a
582.45,624.42, red and has been all the same from years itinerant francoises because for me it's an important part of activism as a kind of a base for activists and campaigning is some sort of social facts
624.84,631.86, in the summer of a thousand lakes the galway social space opened its doors for the first time and the city hasn't been the same since
632.19,634.77, oswald the posters about
635.1,663.06, early year the house coagulated and we felt so as need for social censor in going and there was nothing remotely like a tall just space for we can elongate and just hang and bonitas off each other and create all these classes and workshops and meetings in one of the main watching of community charges definitely niani was always to the church but i think it very important that mescal exist outside of the religious place
663.09,665.88, side of churches and 
665.91,691.95, curtesying in and it's been a great thing in arabia as a community but i am as people now and maybe a stretch going as he used to be a revelation we insouciant be catholic whatever i think it's very important that people fertilized outside of the church community and that does it mean going to the poem it doesn't mean to hang as a cafe
693.09,695.04, and also the people
695.07,716.91, people can have a place that they call the room that someone come in and they know if they want to do they want to put a poster if they want to put up an put a painting if they want to get involved in a place the place they can they can make it the room rather than a rather than having a community hole that's run by the government that you come in and everything
717.09,747.78, come across it fashion i think but the never a part of it that yours is never painting that upon the wall that yours there is in you not about in the running of the place very much this is the government boding you come inhere you can rent room for twenty thirty or an hour which is away some of the work i had to do a the day the space opened and as i had before moving to go ahead i done some research and i knew there was a foot an active here
747.9,759.06, and so and so nabbing a group i know i love from the states like that was a really easy way for me to jump in and 
759.27,773.91, so the day i got here i was like on the noblest and it said something about the galician space and it was like come by and have a cup twenty four little street just longicorns welsh
774.15,778.86, interlingua called there's all kinds of arts there's exhibitions
778.86,780.96, the
781.08,801.45, there's music go on soleure room which is contestin room this load messages rotaries listic sanders the camp campaign group stared her student of bombs as several world shall see me sometimes and then there is sahoe
801.72,827.34, i like people realize that they now have a space that they can start troncoso to sight in campaigns or any kind of anything that comes into the minds paper closed not a suspect to the assimilate is it's a non herriton pro nonprofit religious government influences 
827.37,828.72, pretty much
828.96,836.82, documentary stage and how is much say as any one that's been here for any event to time before and it is very
836.97,858.42, very open door policy community feel about us i think is really important to have space for people to gather where they're not a customer and they don't have to pay to be there at the forehead
858.84,864.09, we asked for a donation of a euro each and amazing that actually brings in a lot of money
864.15,865.77, and during the day
865.77,869.67, the different groups then would leave word at them to let a nation
869.76,876.51, and i recommend a everything they should leave so that i just get in there and foliage and the people respect
876.9,889.65, acoutrements two degrees is separation by saying goalkeeper body knows somebody pretty much like but i too it's very good for the space was words melton it can reach your community groups and
889.65,891.96, quickly
891.96,897.81, support for the furriers the good support for just dropping
897.81,915.51, the space on any even day goshenites testily it is a city but still has the small town community feel about it and that's transforming into the intrinsic as well when in a man for his unweeting of the place 
915.9,943.29, the main idea that basis that is many scars are recared as possible every day or your inhere do you something to learn a new something to teach and i think it's that that most important thing but as long as your cutbill here and your oredan and i be part the community be party yourself just be happy in the face and i saw to his standing is comforting or ethiopic
943.38,945.39, so be comftable in your space
945.42,965.04, it's good to use buildings to bring people together and there a lot of waste building out there in this lotments brought together so yahoos i hope you he creates a feeling that they had transacted altercation
965.31,970.11, in building so that was the goal social space
970.23,987.63, i joined in studio by micronesia spree and cormorants from the galway social space you both very well on to the shores in so first to mark some bring has been on the go in one for another since about two thousand and four as an independent radical social sector
987.66,997.29, and radical independent social centres are just one type amenothes for example being and church or community or sport enters
997.38,1072.05, so where does the independent social center like some poor the galway spaces have its rims and where to the initial the initial idea compromised up correspondence the claim from initially people working together and organize impotent against the summation four am i becancourt recognition that tolerated a canoe that exists in a lot of spaces in the k are different cities read across europe and that word can of organized on hydroaeroplane city and both coralie resources for people with incomparable theodolite or so and experience of a lot of stone squads abenalfange
1072.2,1134.72, activity and also for campaigns and stuff like that i think also specifically in our case it was in response to a very clear need within our city for a kind of a foreshortened that can offered in some ways we felt that the kind of become believin the week to do something new position sense a reaction to the chinese needs of the community as we saw them and also to set extent imported from mosaide in the incinerator of independence of sentiment places and i kind of wanted to meditatin degree that modern
1134.87,1152.81, so are there many such independent social centers ireland and are if there are electioneering together anyway there's a solemn the history of orders being so spectator exist before certainly jars and belfast would one coscoroba live withered or an open the minute
1152.87,1189.08, the faintest of lincoln and was the first and of our social centers and gathering last year which brought together people from me the cawasses and shower spring also people from belfast retreating as well from cork to miserable latin he had venice small social center of there will this no former lingering like that to a misinform level to be sentimental with trichosanthes that we have an unit
1189.08,1356.03, knowledge and information of the animal to the penultimate interest in doing some one projects so that the kind of sad generation knowledge adhereing certainly first i say leave to contain from out the places on the continent satiate but we were also quite aware of a something people can dine and topboots well now the man that we set up was defied in some ways but we had also quite consciously looked at what he attendeth that we felt would actually working away as well and is also intentions what called non hierarchical horizon organizing contest about whynott there and respect of processes at happen quite organically and that it was a group of us that got together and but i also think it's important for the reasons i oninterestin population is quite transient and so if this had opened to a policy and as an any bianco and it means that this i can keep him sort of continuity the dissolute to place from another perspective i think it's extry very important to organize in that way because that's in some way what sets a society from as he said earlier a church groups or in the view between the space therefore i have to responsibility the ossiniboins blunderstone there people involved and with the space itself and i think i mean that organizing in that democratic not harraway aside from the ideological questions it also can be a very effective way of organizing i think i think paradisiacal unitarian like principles alienations of a genuine maintain and i think there is quite strong currents both within social center movements redcross europe in the lilies the larger sort of lilienstein
1356.03,1371.06, certainly with an element of like notions of creativity i like extremely needs to be like nonentitarians and mean both individual participation to the fullest potential i am answered collective realization of different contexts economic of working
1371.06,1383.78, okay so the tears that there's a lot of benefits and you talked about himself and paramount in primitive involved in organizing the social centers what about some of the challenges and then of being involved in these kind of projects
1385.37,1388.94, a few challenges i guess the first being 
1388.94,1401.75, a lot of people you're doing something completely new that you orcadian experiment in some degree or other he cannot take honest what she can be an lessons and experiences or the places and the knowledge has been generated beforehand by others
1401.87,1402.92, and
1403.55,1407.6, one of the things that would find difficult sometimes is kind of the internal work and done and
1407.75,1416.09, of creating like democratic decision that can process is particularly within forms of consensus making our decision making process and
1416.24,1463.55, challenges perhaps also pitfalls but it's work you know we can recognize it as like productive useful work i mean is always certain financial issues is the question of when we do have this to people which is happened like most of the italian would have set up this behavior or at least a good proportion of them i am serious scale of keeping a benefit keeping new people coming in to get people to volunteer and also in abundance
1463.85,1470.51, yet i think for from this perspective showering their like several different kind of projects going on within the space
1470.84,1476.21, i think people would get introduced to the ideas of the spinney different way i am
1476.39,1486.38, some of the ways we try to overcome that is to make stuff is kind of open and explicit detesting the processes of working groups you know which groups tarpons for all aspects of runners berenstoff like that
1486.47,1487.49, and
1487.49,1489.8, i think after approach this for the very
1490.16,1501.5, very you know genuine understanding the people are coming from different perspectives even though they might come from very similar can invest philosophies of like avaient vision for houses at esora is for example and
1501.5,1506.09, come from different places and at different experiences that are only caledonian of
1506.09,1522.83, and cutting means mechanisms to capture that there mark went shoestring a quite small and you start off to sort of one of avenante project has evolved quite a lot from from where you came from initially uses youkahainen and
1522.86,1530.03, still we started it we didn't have a space wenamon we just had a desire to create and askance
1530.06,1542.36, we started off in one of events people can of it was a small loft bunch of people like organized those but we got a lot of support from imitators of people supporting the idea and financial donations
1542.39,1562.73, and give us the impatient of the suggestion that actually there is a desire to need for this you know i am i think we tried to be as stable as possible even though we've had her ups and downs i am a kind of kept kept running with it and more and more people of canada and in some people have can fallen back and that like that the abuse of activity i guess as well but i am
1562.76,1576.47, i become quite stable is quite quite central part of the fabric of what's going on in it so have you any advice for or words of wisdom for somebody who is interested in setting up the room social space a word you think they should start
1576.62,1679.37, well i suppose my experience notably to do it it's very kind of admitting process i think i mean it's important to start small and not to try and go for something big for the past it's quite to get gootther that it's not just one or two people who are one in the show when then of this personal conflicts of somebody move on that the whole poetaster make it something sustainable with his group of people a collective work in together and that way at the responsibilities in the work is shared also the egotistic i can draw on as well and that also helps to canoeing along their friends and it was in the local community and differentiation and away in the west side who were talking about setting up a similar type of protected in the earnestness and hindering find it talked to people but you be ambitious like if you want to realize the city its origin a complaint bounties
1679.7,1696.89, so i'd like to think but if you very much for coming mungerson to sharing your experience and in other wonderful things that are happening within these independent social centers so more information on either shore spree or the galician centre check at the legation the screen at the end of the show
