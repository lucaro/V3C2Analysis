4.35,6.54, i award
7.35,10.2, and to day i want to speak with you
10.44,11.4, but
11.64,14.61, uniting political messages across mediums
15.75,18.66, the reason i like to speak about this
18.96,26.73, because i think it's incredibly important to consider effectiveness of different communication with strategy
26.91,35.46, when trying to effect a change when trying to reach people and when trying to make people care
36.36,40.05, so i guess
40.77,45.48, he give you a little bit of the background about myself about why this is interesting to me
45.48,49.05, and also the worth that i've done before
49.53,50.88, in this field
51.12,52.62, in order to have
52.86,62.04, holly credibility in explaining explaining my perspective on the boat they are and the spaces between them to day
63.66,67.29, myself i
68.43,81.33, first when it might be a bad i conceive it in montreal so i live in montreal and i started out in sculpture and minimum of art i moved towards
81.57,83.13, performance
83.19,84.9, i practice
84.9,93.36, the expanded it just kind of kept expanding and i was working in consensus base theater collective theater in performance projects
93.72,107.01, i also ran a citywide arts festival which was multiplier and then more recently i worked for about a year
107.28,121.44, a secret which he is gillivers ities radio station and other university in montreal now this radio station has a social justice and advocacy centred mandate
121.44,133.47, it's an independent sagen and what that means is for all of the people who support it institutions et cetera but mainly people
134.07,137.46, people powered kind of independent news
137.67,148.38, none of them have influence over what the news is produced by the media group and so this this maintains a certain amount of freedom
148.65,152.19, which is which is very necessary in the media
152.76,156.06, to cover any story that is important to cover
156.09,158.34, so
159.09,167.28, that's how that that's how i i sort of moved into media very interested in interviewing individuals
167.46,169.2, the important thing
169.65,175.71, now about independent media and about what advocacy centered means or with whip
175.71,184.05, advocacy journalism would be is rather than reporting on stories from the typical perspective
184.08,186.06, that is shared
186.06,187.32, the news
187.38,191.79, probably some expert may be some government
192.03,196.14, who runs particular department
196.68,209.61, there are so many experts which we hear talking about issues all the time and interestingly there are many people whose own experiences are not centered in those experiences so we do not hear
209.76,211.8, they have to say about the issues
212.37,219.45, its indigenous issues of land abuse whether it's
219.72,221.13, veterans
221.19,226.08, about their own experiences of returning after war there are just so many
226.08,230.73, groups of people who are really marginal as in media
232.68,235.5, for this agency 
235.5,243.03, the opportunity to meet a lot of very interesting people who are very close to the issues that they were that they were talking about
243.6,248.01, another thing that i would add is that a boy who learns by doing
248.34,256.5, i'm really a maker thinker and i really value this process of going out into the world and try and stop to see what happened and see how fails
256.53,260.85, understand limitations in the benefits of each thing that you do
260.85,269.07, and it took me a long time actually as a sort of an artist maragatos ottomano understand the
269.46,272.91, that was important to me and i think
273.33,284.4, what sort of was a constant threat was actually starting with a message or an issue that i wanted to talk about and realizing that there might be better for
284.58,286.44, could i speak to
286.44,289.65, in body a particular kind of message
289.71,292.8, i am so kind of just kept expanding
293.67,294.69, and
294.75,298.11, always there was a insurgency to what the message was
298.35,304.26, amplify were trying to make if you were trying to speak about the material world
304.26,312.03, you might do a short segment in the problems of plastic in the ocean
312.72,315.81, could also melt whole bunch of plastic together
316.11,318.48, and create a culture that
318.72,320.94, people would experience in the gallery
321.03,326.55, in a phonograph and the actual material would be speaking for itself
327.03,329.37, this is the material his agency
329.67,335.73, it's interesting is thinking about what is the viewers experience of that work
335.73,342.6, what are they going to feel impelled to think about or do when they see this
342.69,349.56, a esthetic thing in his face that was intended for their experience so
350.07,353.34, i say that effective communication strategies
353.76,355.35, consider
355.74,358.92, i do mediator media for which to work
359.22,362.91, they consider their target audience that they
363.18,371.4, we're only talking about political messages here and there are so many ways that you can make or formed and but you have a political message who is the art bodice
371.43,378.72, trying to reach this is important to know because a message could be both resonant or educational
378.96,383.79, and also you need to think about the sense of agency
383.88,389.52, the ouistiti pants of viewers whatever their called in this practice
389.82,392.4, of agents are they going to have
393.0,396.51, so i have all his board
396.51,398.37, different categories
398.61,400.05, mediums
400.11,402.78, which it's possible to convey
402.93,406.98, political messages to grip of people and this is
407.04,413.43, i know means everything this is just a listener in convenience but also think that i have some experience in
414.12,416.85, i actually
416.97,418.35, spectrum
418.53,420.27, the car
420.69,430.86, and the cat what a spectrum is here so we're going from the most active response from
433.08,434.76, the most
435.48,439.59, passing response
440.67,442.02, and
442.47,445.71, the teapot in these rows
445.92,447.99, this advantage
448.14,449.01, his
449.1,453.33, diseases of a particular bed is here
453.54,456.6, advantages
456.69,459.06, fillery
460.02,464.04, in the category of mass media
464.04,465.54, including
465.57,467.19, her tired
467.55,470.85, campaigns television calling with movies
472.2,474.51, of media that reach
474.66,477.78, if people 
478.26,479.19, and
479.4,484.92, they do this by having very large distribution at support behind them
485.4,487.62, terror at finding
489.63,494.55, the disadvantages producing mass media in order to convey a message
494.58,499.89, disparaging and a campaign or a t show or a film
500.16,502.26, which is the tender for large audiences
503.52,505.74, a spoonful of sugar
505.89,508.14, it palatable
510.48,515.67, you are producing a very large forms of
515.76,519.09, if your producing large media forms
521.01,525.9, going to have a lot of investors and stakeholders and
525.99,532.11, whether their institutional or or individual
532.11,540.18, but there's going to be a lot of money behind it because the distribution cost a lot because the production costs a lot so that means that
540.6,550.23, to please a lot of people in the production of your message and because of that what happens is it very likely that your message will be diluted
550.32,552.99, if you're message is
553.08,554.76, any way radical
554.82,556.68, anyway marginal
556.68,571.41, you're going to have to reduce some of the impact of what you're trying to say i also making it palatable for the public so that more people will be open to minute or gradual change but not everything at last
571.71,575.85, and for many people is an absolute transgression is not possible for them to work
575.94,577.59, that much of the center
577.95,579.81, what a benefit
580.35,584.55, no and the watson is one hot feminist
585.12,590.16, you can find like wipe or
590.25,594.27, well now or familiar characters its
594.33,599.46, to convey your message and share it and personally rapid
600.72,609.42, who like them now that the public at large is going to be a little more open minded about receiving with that messages
609.45,610.98, so
611.34,613.17, somewhat
613.2,617.55, another example would be of this working
617.97,620.01, how repulsive
620.4,625.02, this is a television show which has effectively visible ized
625.11,626.4, the
626.79,631.44, large picture of gender identity and sexual identities
631.59,640.05, possible and also a culture and an artistic creative underground cabaret drag alter that has been around since the eighties
640.08,643.05, but has been
643.2,651.3, and remains the martians something that involved as a kind of resistance but now putting it into the public eye
651.6,654.69, all has in some ways
654.9,657.69, is not only visible yet
657.84,670.41, this whole other world that may be will maybe never knew about but is actually normalized because its familiar because you see the episodes each week and even to know the characters and they don't seem so strange a more
671.94,672.75, that
673.53,675.24, journalists
675.3,678.15, the instantea and independent
678.36,679.8, this would be
679.8,698.19, organization and national news agencies foxes and there you have the encounter we have cantalacan on the independent side instead
698.97,706.02, what are some of the biggest struggles and set back for new producers will
706.08,707.7, yesterday had left
708.09,714.93, news is constantly disappearing there is always new news and
715.53,720.45, you know there's an doing struggle to keep information relevant
721.2,725.43, he facts remembered well at the same time
725.58,727.56, contributing to this
727.62,731.94, information but the information often feels like an overflow
731.97,734.82, and and
735.3,737.76, so the will to immediacy
738.09,743.22, simply reporting on and documenting events does not necessarily explain
744.21,746.76, provide a basis for understanding
746.82,750.3, how those events halesia issues
750.3,751.68, connected
751.77,754.32, and so it's possible
754.83,756.51, either to
756.63,759.6, do a lot of work to
759.75,760.71, at
761.01,767.25, to past events and maintain a narrative within your news agency
767.46,775.32, so that things do not seem so overwhelming and confusing and unusual but actually a part of
775.74,777.33, history
777.66,786.96, after possible to really create narrative which confuses people or which creates a narrative that actually isn't true i mean
788.01,790.08, the level of reporting stories
790.08,790.92, there is
790.98,802.02, it publication to not live to would happen but it should not happen of but you're not lying but you can connect ideas and thoughts
802.17,808.77, and a decided business which can be quite negatively propagandistic into
808.8,811.65, convey a sense of 
811.68,814.86, on one side of his travel or convey particular bias
816.03,818.4, what are benefits
819.0,823.62, people up to date what the hell is going on people know what
823.68,825.39, are happening
825.42,834.51, what people are working on both a far and near by and not only does give them a sense of
835.05,839.37, what's happening in the world but also how things
839.7,844.44, how movements how events how behaviors of governments
845.61,847.26, similar
847.26,851.16, all over and the potential to learn from those
851.16,857.19, so now i overcolor art and astonishing fulsome needle of the spectrum
857.22,859.38, most passive to the most active
861.66,868.05, in this category are just talking about honoratus it so just having about visual art
868.14,874.98, gallery are odd things that you would experience alone probably in a solitary way
876.06,878.88, and so some of the
878.91,883.59, of the producers in to reach many people with their massage
884.16,885.87, will to novelty
886.38,889.2, you are casting me
889.41,891.66, now it's
891.96,906.0, incredibly important for our artists to be innovating and this is how they get to the front of their field and then in people don't even reach that stage and so is quite difficult even to get
906.03,907.83, space in the gallery
908.4,911.49, so said the water novelty
911.73,916.59, no sort of new knowledge through creative research
916.77,918.72, it's something that
918.84,924.51, memorable and something that the cause of how memorable and is and how in the way to be experience it
924.6,927.99, actually can be invented in history than
928.02,934.92, have reason to write about memorable experiences in this art history happens that way
935.46,937.08, and
939.36,940.71, the
941.13,942.21, the
942.21,944.61, benefits let focus on that
946.32,949.02, the personal is political
949.32,955.62, experience art it's possible to see things through somebody else's land entirely
955.68,957.36, and so
957.57,959.04, is possible to
959.07,961.62, a kind of indirect
961.62,964.83, the transferring to what i mean by that is
965.94,968.25, again see things seeing things
968.28,971.13, the eyes were in the ears
971.13,975.12, another person the way that they have chosen to recreate reality
975.27,976.98, it conveys
977.28,982.47, a best but like a sentiment in an experience which is foreign
982.95,983.91, this
984.06,985.35, increases
985.35,988.83, experience of what empathy is
989.46,991.41, now
994.23,996.42, looks different ways of thinking
996.84,1000.02, that's why i've called this feeling pebbles
1000.14,1002.36, my new work from what art is
1002.42,1004.64, but in fact it
1005.48,1009.23, we think about the problems whether it
1009.38,1015.44, our sexes or donald tremor the fast food industry
1015.59,1025.67, these are a problem that we experience now to day they are urgent but they are also a part of the law history of startled and resistance and these had problems
1025.67,1027.68, written about what
1028.01,1032.96, are working on in all kinds of ways academic people in all kinds of fields
1033.2,1041.87, they're not things that we can solve it now it's not possible to have like an immediate solution to this thing and it's going to be an ongoing that
1042.92,1045.38, what a feeling puzzled us
1045.59,1050.42, it creates a novel kind of way to rethink
1050.72,1052.04, about a thing
1052.1,1061.79, instead of feeling completely open well and then unable to to fix the problem
1061.79,1064.13, there's nothing about
1064.55,1067.49, are that says you have to understand what this means
1067.88,1074.51, but there is the expectation that it's going to be mysterious kind of obscure in its way to take of
1075.14,1080.36, into and so the sensorial qualities of art work
1080.45,1089.63, i remember physically we experienced that and then we walk away from it and we keep thinking about that and we puzzled through
1089.78,1096.98, that this might be trying to change and fluviatile on the one particular issue which is important
1098.39,1105.5, activism so after his these are grass roots and bottom of movements and with that means as
1105.62,1114.32, on hierarchical organization people who are getting together outside of like large institutions in forming their own institutions
1114.5,1118.16, small organizations sometimes large ones
1118.34,1127.34, activism does not necessarily mean protesting in the street or rationalis that it could be it could be writing to prisoners
1127.82,1145.55, just let him be no that they haven't been completely erased from the world of humanity it might be working on disability resources and trying to increase accessibility of legacy like the curs onsituwated it might be
1145.7,1148.4, there anyway to do activator
1148.55,1152.48, some of the disadvantages are of this
1152.48,1154.25, the rising people
1154.7,1156.89, then every one will know what i think
1157.25,1161.51, there is a very real fear of that many people have and not for
1161.54,1171.53, reasons of confrontation i can be quite scary to fright both authority members and also members of your own community
1171.56,1174.23, a subjection
1175.91,1178.43, and
1178.91,1180.77, the reality is
1181.58,1182.75, that
1186.14,1187.7, at that
1188.06,1190.64, not benefits
1191.18,1192.41, activism
1192.44,1195.74, no politics of respectability allowed
1196.07,1199.94, the messages were his means of respectability politics
1200.15,1203.63, are not restricted by their internal members
1203.81,1206.9, in the radical perspectives into the general discourse
1209.75,1213.29, ability politics is the thing that can happen within
1213.29,1218.3, after the circles or or circles around her singular subject where people
1219.59,1222.26, that their messages
1222.38,1233.48, their language needs to be diluted and more palatable in order to receive a larger group of members and participants and and that is really something that i think
1233.57,1238.49, and radical organizing cease to reduce this
1238.76,1240.44, reality at all
1240.53,1248.66, that people within the fort not sensed people are actually working together on the issue transparently honestly boldly
1249.29,1252.47, this also reflects on the need for extremes
1252.74,1253.82, because
1253.88,1256.67, is this term that
1256.85,1260.39, and you really look at issues that are called radical
1260.69,1272.48, then i would say that there actually very basic human rights issues people who want to have safe work environments whatever their kinds of work are
1272.51,1278.33, you know people who who want basic forms of respect recognition health services
1278.69,1280.64, who are otherwise like
1280.67,1282.05, restricted
1282.11,1285.32, lots of basic human rights i would say that
1286.22,1287.33, i have been
1287.33,1292.64, into being other stating in largely what the reality is that
1292.67,1295.1, marginal groups of people
1295.1,1296.69, basic needs
1296.75,1298.67, are recognized
1298.91,1302.21, so instead
1302.42,1305.42, the possibility for minority groups to speak up
1305.51,1312.53, or even you know large people who had previously been engaged in issue with the coming gate
1314.3,1323.18, to look at especially engaged our activism thiselton performance are relational art federalistic things that are done in groups
1323.42,1325.19, around political messages
1325.49,1327.89, in this category the disadvantages
1329.36,1332.15, rotating me what to think
1332.84,1335.87, now it's very possible 
1336.23,1343.55, it can happen that a work with political messages can feel overly didactic
1343.7,1349.31, and this kind of goes against the larger of making work and making feelings as
1350.54,1357.17, and it's not necessarily the case but it's possible so this is something to be conscious of
1357.41,1360.68, imitation is the fact that
1361.37,1363.77, making the pufformance
1363.86,1369.53, with a group of people well there are people who are going to want to have in that and they're people who aren't
1369.62,1381.41, so now every one is actually comfortable at being the center of attention and that the reality has imitation that you have to work with their certain people who will participate will come to events who will engage in their
1381.89,1383.54, people who will not
1385.58,1388.7, now in terms of what is beneficial
1389.21,1390.65, talk about
1391.28,1392.48, the benefit 
1392.81,1394.64, engaged at activism
1394.94,1396.35, you feel 
1398.24,1405.77, is possible in all arts practices to reach a kind of empathic transference
1406.82,1412.97, the arts field it happens without a body even there without the artist but that is
1413.06,1420.92, when social engaged work the relationship is actually a part of the work
1421.28,1425.72, building relationships is actually a part of the work
1426.32,1428.0, so
1428.15,1430.55, this sense of
1430.64,1435.68, elated to the other is incredibly immediate and this has a certain
1435.86,1436.94, to it
1438.05,1439.22, again as
1439.94,1446.63, we're on this fully all this and now of the spectrum of the most active was to get people involved
1448.19,1450.14, people are
1450.23,1460.94, building works themselves over their participating in was that directly i located where they are embodying perhaps another person's identity of their acting foreman
1460.94,1467.18, perhaps they're just speaking thoughts of another person that there are many ways to make the sense of
1467.3,1471.2, related to the other quite urgent and the work
1471.29,1473.57, other things that are great
1474.08,1479.72, but this form and about art in general abstraction absurdity humor
1479.78,1483.71, he forms made it possible to explore difficult and heavy content
1483.77,1488.9, with your personal background for the narrative that they just collectedly shared

1502.82,1504.56, i presented this
1504.74,1508.49, assentation just last week

1544.67,1545.81, i
1545.9,1550.49, this which means having all of the feelings of one

1553.82,1555.8, audience comes open
1556.52,1560.99, reach a level of such feeling collectively that
1561.77,1564.35, a transformation becomes possible
1565.94,1572.87, the rest of the steps all representation for you thanks for your time to thinking about this with me to day
1572.9,1575.99, the question that i will just leave you with
