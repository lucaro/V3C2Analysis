1.95,5.67, the project began when i was sitting in a therapy session
5.76,14.07, and i was looking at this very generic very ugly painting on the wall and as i looked closer at the print i noticed that there was a crack
14.1,45.96, as malice at the crack i noticed that in it was launched the single hair when i left i couldn't stop thinking about it as i walked on the street as i came home i just kept thinking of that hair and thinking about whose hero could be you know what they might look like what they might do i just kept seeing her everywhere and i kept thinking about all these forensic shows and we want it and the fascination that we have with that science was defiance of trying to figure out from evidence who was there
48.24,51.27, he
52.17,72.0, the car project than a working on is called stranger vision and it is essentially an exploration of what we can learn about a person from a hair and it also explores this kind of possibility for genetic surveillance
72.06,82.59, so things like hair skin saliva were constantly shutting these traces all over the place in public and not even thinking about it
83.64,92.49, though i'm going to cut just at a tiny bit of the root and if the hair in particular were looking for
96.18,98.58, one centimeter piece
98.82,107.04, the process begins when i discover hair my anatomie been thisaway trying italian and all dinginess
107.28,114.9, janice is it fully functional molecular biology lab where people can come from very diverse backgrounds
115.11,121.5, experience dana based technology in a very visceral hands on way
121.77,141.54, you kind of know what you need to do you start going in now do your internet research you start looking through the articles in the papers and then you come across the protocol and so the protocol will list episodes exactly what you need to do like a recipe they were going to add some protected and break down a sell
141.72,163.77, originally i was just thinking you know i'll see if i can extract in from the hair and then i'll see what that can turn in it maybe it'll be some kind of portrait the first all i had was to do with two dimensional portrait and then that idea eventually grew into the idea of doing a whole physical sculpture to print an actual freeborn
164.55,182.13, in a way this project kind of came out of a popular concepts of science and when you want to vishnoo you want to show a bonfire where are you know her some tiny fragment of something is found in suddenly against turned into the entire person's face
182.13,185.94, attack
185.94,189.87, then there's always an element of truth there
190.77,195.9, i started looking at the forensic i started wondering what i could now
196.29,200.1, assuming that from her i got a perfect folgen
200.28,206.16, if i can have my pick of that go how much can i possibly know about what this person looks like
206.22,210.69, in my initial research i discovered that there are a set of snipes
210.9,218.85, is a single nuclear time polymorpha sniper just part of the gnome that vary by one base pair
218.91,231.81, to person and that particular base pair is linked to traits or disease risks she let single sniff is a clue you know that you probably have rallies
231.9,234.6, probably have little
234.78,235.38, he
235.77,246.75, this is the steps fred sheet so that you can see here is that i've organized this list of locations on the gentle to traits that interested in
247.17,252.99, there have been large studies done with people where all of the ships and their entire gnome
253.02,254.52, ben looked at
254.79,262.89, then that data has been correlated with things like their susceptibility to certain diseases and appearance may be here or i collar
263.19,279.72, a lot of the traits that are common traits that we think of associated with appearance like her color and i collar are the result of multiple teens i heard an estimate that her height was something like co operatively between tender forces
280.11,283.23, so i am could be composed of different snips
283.29,287.31, and be you know just one it could be could be 
288.66,293.1, so you know the correlation is not always a simple one
293.46,308.76, in order to do this project which required is essentially squinting forty different locations on the genial so this is the den at the bottom of the tube and what remains in the filter are the cells from the hair
308.91,310.71, from that day the
310.74,313.02, i can check for certain traits
313.2,325.5, when they run to picton one espanol and one as the mystery so there is the civilised extracting dna there's also differently of analyzing
325.56,330.12, then the kind of lowest tech oldest method
330.12,335.46, which is one that i've been using so far as to run per which is puritan reaction
335.82,341.7, paris is it's a process by which you can amplify sections of the no
341.85,350.4, so by taking dana and adding what's called a prime or to it i can say basically here is an indian point on the china
350.4,360.57, take everything between this and this and amplify it make a bunch of bunch of copies of it when a this primer to these little containers here these tiny little guys
360.69,369.39, others doing she's using primers that have been designed to target a region that tells us something about a person's ancestry
369.78,375.48, the thing into areas that code for propensity to be over weight or not
375.99,379.86, cler and i collar is actually one of the first
380.7,383.1, has been rolled out to the police
383.28,384.21, and
384.3,387.63, law enforcement around the world to use in a kit
387.81,392.01, there is now a cat that is available is called iris plans
392.31,394.44, it allows
394.86,400.35, time and a crime scene to take a beginning sample and were quickly ascertained the i collar
400.62,409.35, suspect and then i want to allowancing it in the portrait sat on lassooing at her so looking at her color
409.71,414.51, areas that curve for later versus darker skin freckles
414.87,438.21, the gender so this involves making new primers to look for those particular sits within the gnome what i've been doing so far as actually using kit said the next step for me actually is releiving out how to get into that primores or to find some one who can help me with that trotted speret all that's
438.54,440.4, what can there
440.73,448.08, once you have that amplified section of the genoa you can take it and send it to a company for squinting and so when i get back from them
448.5,452.85, these files which you can open up in a texas
452.91,456.12, you can see very simply the result of that squinting
456.12,459.33, i can see the cod here to a written now
459.87,467.88, enviable into a custom program that i wrote to the program does two things for little pietist of traits
467.88,474.6, now i can run this na get traits i can add this in and the result of the analysis
474.63,476.34, and now he says
476.94,482.43, european female heavier heavier skinner skinner skinny or heavier
482.55,487.08, sounds like there's a percent chance here being overweight or not
487.32,492.75, light skin european fifty six percent chance of brown eyes
493.05,497.46, percent chance of green eyes straight hair and freckles
497.7,500.34, and then it will call another program that i wrote
500.43,502.02, generates a face
502.41,511.44, so the face generating program was based off of some facial recognition research that attains working on a bass switzerland
511.47,520.59, and so what i did was i took that framework that they were working with and i kind of expanded it and turned it around so that i can become a facial generating program
521.79,532.32, we're not at the point yet were we and taken no exactly what somebody looks like or where they came from but in a lot of cases we can get a pretty good general idea
533.13,537.63, one of the mysteries is why these snips
537.72,542.91, associated with particular traits sometimes it's in a very obvious gen
543.27,552.99, human groan and a red blood cell disease however most of these correlations that have been found aren't as easily explainable
553.26,560.34, that kind of probable signature and something that i wanted to prove with this peace
560.55,562.95, i'm really interested in that uncertainty
563.7,565.98, i'm interested in exploring
566.31,580.29, uncertain about now but maybe certain of in the future and i actually working puppet or pay who came mechant what i'd really like to do
580.29,590.82, also to explore it and the research for ages still new and one of mingled for the sisters at least to ascertain whether is possible for me to
590.94,593.31, the age from sample
593.58,611.64, then this new study that came out recently about facial structure so they found some gens in europeans which code for specific arrangements of features on the face locations being like the cheek bones the centers of the eyeballs tipped the nose tapottes bottom centre of the nose
611.7,616.86, as of the nostril hitherward is really interesting because
617.22,619.77, a very accessible way
619.77,624.48, the public to engage with the new technology
624.54,632.88, really brings to light how powerful it is the idea that a hair from your head can fall on the street
632.88,635.34, a perfect stranger can take it up
635.37,705.96, no something about you and with danceing becoming faster and cheaper this is the world were all going to be living in so the kind of big as influence this project has had on me and that now i am very aware of everything that i leave behind so when i sat on the subway and you know on my hands though my hair i notice if there's a hair on my hand and it falls to the ground and the otway you know i pay attention to all this stuff now if i go to a bar and having her and you know leave a little salivate in the bottom of the cup i think about it now
