6.03,36.42, i saith the group elphinstone logging focus we are a local force watchdog group we try anticipate where logging could be happening in our local community we had about forty people of to day the sister second walk in the forest and appertaining to become a bit more conscious of what is in here what could be lost filandieres has got plans to come in here and do clear cut logging the old style
36.6,43.38, big clear cut were used to seeing around here they're part of our huge multinational corporation
43.38,55.65, of atonement would headquarters in new york city and if you're ever falling occupy movement they own the park in new york city that the protesters were living in
55.77,63.81, we understand they want to just come in and pretty much take out everything all the growths
63.84,67.86, the smaller trees right up to the edge of roberts creek
68.07,83.85, and that would be a real loss to the community first of all be to the cougar stretching tree and then we'll go on to the waterfall it's a really heavily used area for recreation there all sorts of different trail types in here
83.88,109.98, horseback riding mountain viking ting and just casual walking at a well used are in fact a lot of people think it's a part cause it's been in this natural state for quite some time mclellan previous to islanders that it with wire hawser mc mellow dorian to do a clear cut
110.07,113.91, style operation and here the community was upset
114.09,122.61, have the opportunity of meeting with the local contractor and that blow and they came up with a really nice compromise
122.88,144.09, so today we have some selectively laforce where they took out maybe percent of the trees they left most of the old growth around the trails and then they took out five to six acre patches so were asking in the timberland respect that prior agreement with the community
144.3,145.5, just
146.88,155.28, the areas that they actually planted so they did some kind of selective logging where they took out percent of the trees and then they could these open
157.17,165.99, he 
170.01,176.49, when i was a kid many of our utilities and things like that were shared the
176.52,177.6, by us
177.9,182.79, public companies whereas now everything's been private and taken out of our hands
182.94,186.0, along with you know we had all this
186.24,195.84, legislation that said things like you're not supposed to log right into the creek and things that are kind of basic ecosystem things to like not like an ecosystem know no
195.9,202.29, what's happened is i created legislation at the end of every piece of legislation that says not withstanding logging
202.29,209.1, basically means don't be don't do bad things unless it means you can't log and in that case you can just law anyway
209.28,218.13, it's the ultimate deregulation and there's just no regard for the environment whatsoever and we're not asking people to stop logging were discussing them to use their you know
218.37,220.11, common sense and
220.11,228.3, legislation that protects like things like our water protects really important trees that are you know protecting endangered or threaten species
228.48,238.5, real basics that can help the ecosystem maintain itself i've bin taken mushrooms here for life well maybe eight years and identifying them all the time
238.56,241.2, always finding mushrooms that are just not in books
243.18,244.59, no idea what it is
245.22,248.01, think i was foolish to think that we can 
248.19,252.84, can destroy some of the last habitat of these you know billions of year old creatures
252.96,265.11, as if it doesn't matter when the reality is some of these mushrooms might have some of the alchemist that might save us from whatever cancer or whatever paleness have long been dismal property so it's
265.47,275.97, certainly something worth looking into but you go to the even in the interior in the see and you don't find the amount of concentrated mushrooms within a small area
275.97,283.17, here as everywhere always the temanite it middle whenever season here all is always a bunch mushrooms and yawns
284.37,286.05, a unique persistent
287.73,293.58, what happens is when trees are caught and especially uprooted like clearcut
294.72,300.69, the ex water from rain falls coming down from the mountain disgusted
300.72,305.01, sort of sore by the roots like all those trees that were there
305.19,308.76, and all the water including the mushroom and celia
308.94,313.86, and then you have the season of water but just pours down the mountain and
314.22,318.84, the community like will have you know we could have was out and so forth right
319.17,329.34, i think it makes sense for island to merlin's to talk to the community and let them know what they're planning on doing because people live right there roberts freakish there and there's old growth trees all along the creek
329.37,332.7, good for the community to participate and let
332.79,341.91, we wanted let them know we were thinking and they should let us know what they are thinking before they go ahead even if they do at the legal rate come in your in lawer they want
342.09,345.45, according to the province i think it just makes sense for there to be some
345.87,346.77, talking
347.1,352.89, we're hoping lanterns will meet with the community well in advance of setting down any
353.04,363.72, to bring in their equipment we think we can come to an agreement if the company is willing to come out listen to
364.08,368.97, the community has to say there have to be some give and take
372.15,381.66, you know if we don't see some better communication with the company were just concerned that there could be a confrontation doesn't have to come to that
382.02,389.73, because there's lots of opportunities for them to get their wood and the community to retain their wonderful force through here
