4.86,14.64, side by side was a documentary made with canaries and probably we first started discussing it in the summer and fall of two thousand ten
14.82,46.08, we're working on a movie called henry's crime no as in the movies as producer on it he helped the felt the script and i was postproduction supervisor one day canoas to me hey we should make a documentary about now where the film business is right now so i said of course i'll make a document
46.89,66.27, we interviewed a hundred and forty people for side by side seventy people ended up making an into the final film
66.66,95.22, piano did a lot of the interviews i did a lot of the interviews as well and we would have questions that we would prepare and canon i would kind of go over those before we went into the interview with people when i was doing the interviews i kind o stuck to the questions and piano also did but he was more conversational so that the conversation could drift enough one question could lead to something else that was
95.25,103.59, eventually we would cover all the questions but it was kind of a round about way which i think was excellent and i put a lot of the
103.71,133.47, interviews in a very relaxed attitude you see people who are you know scores james cameron david fincher and there seem really relaxed like you sitting in there living room with them in their having a conversation with cane because pretty much that's what was happening a lot of the people were interviewing are very busy there working directors tepees and to find even you know a small amount of time for them to sit down and give an interview
133.62,139.56, difficult most people we reached out to were interested in doing the project but it was just a matter of
139.59,147.54, up schedules for instance christopher nolan was very difficult to get and we knew he was an important person to have in a documentary
147.57,180.99, strong feelings about film at first when we reached out he was not available said we can meet with you any time anywhere on planet earth we need half an hour he said he doesn't have half an hour conolly sent him a type written letter telling them about the private doing asking can increase far some time which he did which was very generous of him we went to the set he was working on when in his trailer said our cameras up really quickly and got a great interview the house keys
181.2,198.51, hadn't given an interview i think in years or something like that and they were in berlin there working on cloud alice and measure you know they love canoe loves them and a true you know friendship and respect so we flew out there set up the cameras in there apartment and
198.57,206.43, shot an interview so as a lot of you know moving fast setting up quickly and never knowing when someone was going to be available he had to
206.49,208.8, leave the edit room and pay 
208.86,211.86, this week and we're going to los angeles were going to
211.95,213.57, london
213.99,240.96, our set up was very light very low cost and pretty easy to operate in use we used to little panachee we'd have two of those for the interview one would be locked off on the subject the deprecated would have handhold and he would you know shootest indifferent
240.99,276.48, and also turned to piano for the questions and things like that so were able to cut back and forth in editorial between those two cameras alighting depended on the situation we interviewed people in all different types of rooms interiors exteriors back rooms in a theatre in poland basement in england literally all all differentations that as i said this people are very busy so when they showed up or if they were available we need to be able to travel their quickly we also need to be able to set up an break down and locations very quickly
276.66,318.48, for editing you know we had shot a number of of interviews but we hadn't cut anything together yet the guy we chose was a great editor named mike long he came in and started cutting things so we didn't have a scriptural but we did have a kind of a rough outline really for me i wanted the documentary to be tight i don't want to just be educational i wanted it to be also engaging and entertaining there was a lot of humour in the interviews david wintering a little funny story or someone else swearing or you know some while festooning really passionate about something any time there was that kind of
318.78,337.62, sort of juicy human bit to i would try to include that so it wasn't again this very dry encyclopedic type of documentary it had some you know human feeling and emotion and which i thought would be pretty hard to find in the dock like this but i think we tried to squeeze out
337.62,351.51, thin we could robert downie account me and he said i can't work like this i never get to go to my trail i never get my ship together a on my feet for ten hours a day i'm shooting all the time he actually left
351.81,354.24, magarth urine
354.42,458.28, the set just like over in the corner and stuff just you go off near dinnering back and it was so like form of protest we do have some animation and graphic in the movie a fell fred general audience who i wanted this to appeal to the need to have even just a most basic understanding of what was being discussed i think sometimes i think of my parents you know do they know tiennette is they know how peace of film work did they know how digital chip works you know things like that they are certain moments were something needed to be explained just i wanted to be brief and i don't want it to be too technical and i wanted to be simple people could owe that's what this is that's what that means and then they could move on and enjoy the rest of the movie music naturally has emotion to it and when music has emotion to it it makes you feel a certain way when you watching image did you color correction began replacing traditional photo chemical methods of colored time a lot of times the tricky part of this was a kind of taking the emotion out of the music for the majority of the clephane something that was just sort of driving it or giving a rhythm or a bead or but no nothing that was you know sad or triumphant or all those things that score normally does it move we wanted kind of facts to speak for themselves so we hired the ryan brothers billy ryan and brendon ryan they would send me music stuff they had in their library or we would sometimes edit in a piece of music and then we want something like this or something that illustrates the same thing
458.46,481.74, there are so many different types of documentaries too you know there's documentaries that follow a character story there's documentaries that are about just a subject or a scientific thing i think you want to make fieubet or scientific someone that was interviewing me once said the judge it or critic whether it's three ease entertaining
482.01,485.34, engaging and educational
485.73,510.03, if you can hit those things with a documentary that's you know trying to inform someone of something i think you'll probably be successful i think when young documentary filmier if i had advice for them don't be afraid if you have a good idea that you feel like it's a story that you want to tell and you feel like you'd do a good job at telling it
510.57,516.36, you should go out there and do it i mean there's the technology is around today where you can do it very inexpensively
516.36,533.88, you can do it all on your own you can shoot it you can eat it if you can post it you can market it you can if you have the time and i think young people do have the time and they have the energy and don't be afraid to you know reach out as far as you can you know if you think
533.88,536.37, the best person to
536.88,541.8, this question of you know say that to yourself and then go out and
542.04,547.65, try to get that person you know if you don't tie would be the best person to do
547.68,549.84, music for this reach out
549.93,574.2, that person you know and there's other like minded young people i'm sure who are just dying for the opportunity to add it something to shoot something to help you out the harder you work the luckier you get you know once you get something in motion as well once you had the skies got a camera he shooting starting to envy things start to snowball you have a few interviews in the can or you have some footage
574.2,584.1, he starts to become real and other people then notice that it's real and are attracted to it a man to be involved so it's getting out there
584.37,615.54, and doing it and not being afraid to enter
