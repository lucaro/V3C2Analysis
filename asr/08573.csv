1.53,15.87, the hartebeest
16.08,59.49, elaborateness
60.42,63.18, peaceful in the morning isn't it fact that's name
63.27,66.06, shall a city of peace
67.47,71.25, it's also the birthplace a three fates
71.91,72.96, jewish faith
73.11,74.31, it
74.46,75.96, the muslim people
76.35,80.82, the song was also says pray for the peace of jerusalem i wonder why
80.88,91.29, probably because prophetically he knew that it would be also the clash of the fire point for all three of those fates because they all consider this place is very holy
91.59,93.93, example the temple mount
94.26,97.38, abraham was a sacrifice a son is
97.68,103.86, and so the jewish people had built solomon's temple over that mass where the holy holes was located
104.34,111.0, however one of the things we have to remember is that abraham is the father of the arabic people as well
111.21,114.45, one is as the father of the arab nation
114.72,117.39, comes the muslim faith
117.78,122.43, it was there that also mohammed was to have ascended into heaven
122.61,125.28, so they see it as very holy as well
126.15,129.87, when israel became a state in nineteen forty eight
129.93,139.47, they pushed the people who are arabic people living in palestine now called palestinians into sections gaza strip
140.25,141.33, bank
141.69,143.46, and the goal on heights
143.94,146.01, well in the sixth day war
146.19,148.26, israel took them all back
148.77,157.41, the arab people living there have their homes in their farms and so they could live there but they were under military occupation
158.07,167.16, then the interval or the uprising where the palestinian said enough of this we've lost our home he pushed us into these little strip areas
167.43,175.98, now we're under military occupation were going to fight back but only had were stones the israeli armies
176.1,179.25, third or fourth strongest army in the world today
179.4,180.39, so
180.45,181.92, through stones
182.28,185.73, rising the defend themselves they didn't know what to do
186.18,187.65, they went into
187.74,189.18, suicide bombing
189.3,190.71, because they're so desperate
191.19,195.0, so much struggle so much confusion and conflict
195.06,202.2, we're going to talk to some people about some of that conflict and the reason behind it may be some ways that it can be resolved
202.35,206.04, then let's continue to pray for the peace
206.4,233.73, terrorism is a terrible thing
234.3,238.5, to find the reason behind terrorism is not an easy task because
238.56,241.38, fine and unearth wounded people
241.71,242.43, her
243.36,244.92, just actions
245.22,246.27, history
246.57,247.59, religion
247.68,253.2, and they all combine and clash together to form a pretty toxic mixture
254.22,256.68, example the hearts of the israeli people
256.74,263.46, go back to the diaspora when they were scattered all over the world through conquest after conquest
264.15,265.98, the most glaring example
265.98,267.84, something we call the holocaust
268.11,271.92, the nazi regime and attempt to do some ethnic cleansing
272.46,275.46, killed six million jewish people
275.58,277.62, women and children
278.19,284.73, at that time the jewish people and the world realize that they needed a place to call home
285.33,287.01, directly after that
287.22,291.09, began to immigrate back to israel
291.45,295.08, it became a nation again
295.44,332.91, by that time palestinians are arabs had already settled the land and had been living there for generations the sunshine was twenty two is walking down the street and then he would a street on that evening december one when the two terrorists blew themselves up and left a third bomb in a car to try to get the rescue workers after they were gone in a gunther dirty work she has nine children but she spends most of her time and really round the clock here with her son charon for me her most joy be
333.39,335.34, i killed every day
335.46,340.53, so many we have so many ruined families you know i know many families of
340.59,350.49, just lost her she was lachine i have two neighbours one of them was killed these it was 
350.58,373.53, years old destinies old he was kensington down town in beniamino ones badly injured fleetfoot bailienochy beforetime in charlottetown sung
381.36,386.82, i palestine christian i was a boy in a penfold
386.91,396.6, design is to came in to my own town a few days they occupied this occupied it we did not have
396.72,400.38, army to defend they just
400.74,409.29, i watched them thrive come into into my hotel a few days later they gave us an order
409.59,418.02, said you have to get out of town with into ours if you don't make it it we lost everything within two hours
418.68,426.36, people a population of miton everyone was displaced
426.81,435.12, and that's only one example of what happened to over four other and fifty thousand villages to out aristide
435.15,446.25, is now part of israel and then in order to prevent the refugees those are who devoted to prevent the refugees from returning
446.52,464.07, i jes windows over four other and fifty thousand villages the people who resign as are those that feel god gave them the land from the beginning and there should be no other kinds of people in this land just jewish or a jewish state and so they don't want
464.07,494.19, any palestinians in the gaza or the west bank or in the colonies they wanted all the emotions the temple mount had been in the hand
494.22,498.72, moslems for over one thousand four hundred years
499.08,502.53, nobody can tell the muslims today this is not your
503.94,510.72, in one thousand rears this is five times more than white people had been in america
511.56,521.79, who can tell now jordberga is not our country get out of there but i can say that to church but why should anybody controlled there
522.0,533.04, he took position of that piece of property for one thousand four hundred years and immediately said this is no use because there are some people who are better than you
533.13,544.8, he deserved that country because god gave it to them or someone else gave it to them and refugees now nearly five million had been displaced in the camps and syria lebanon jordan
545.04,574.17, in the west bank as well so there was an armistice line between what became the state of israel and the west bank down through those years between nineteen forty eight and nineteen sixty seven nineteen years jordan ruled the west bank and egypt ruled the gastric it's a very difficult issue but the world understood that the israeli people needed a place to call home
574.35,580.74, and so they have israel and besides that they have no place else to go
580.95,585.69, fight for that land tooth and nail and because of that
585.87,587.7, conflict spreads
588.0,594.48, in the skin of out of the blue
594.6,595.95, he attacked
597.45,598.47, jordan
598.59,606.42, syria and to show the absolute superiority of the israeli army with
606.78,612.06, tremendous support from the united states it only took them six days
612.15,616.59, defeat all three armies and to take over the west bank
616.59,621.48, the gaza strip what is called the west bank is the area where
621.48,680.88, almost all the biblical events took place yes from abusing the north were chafeth capitals of another kingdom was to remain which is rome the birthplace of the prophet samuel jerusalem you know hebron where the maskers to day and where david was king for seven years before it all this that that's the biblicists and israel had a kind of ideological agenda about we must own the land that was our forefathers to letters really territorial aggrandisement the decision they wanted to complete this was part of the agenda that led to their decision to the bank and immediately stitches
681.48,683.01, is that a
683.04,685.41, god because their cows
686.01,687.51, i
688.05,694.44, justice and injustice whether it is done by jews or done by palestinians
694.53,700.38, by americans or by anybody else what is unjust is unjust
700.41,706.5, in justice it easy to catch that word to things and people we don't understand
706.71,712.29, one group or one side or to anyone who doesn't look like us
712.53,715.92, the same is true with other words such as terror is
716.58,722.31, but terrorism if you think about it doesn't lie with just one thrinity or with one culture
722.73,726.39, actually terrorism lies within the very hearts of men
726.57,732.93, on both sides on all sides whether they be arabs or israeli even americans
733.41,735.39, and all the people of terrorism
735.51,738.45, innocent people will be caught in a cross fire
739.08,746.4, but the question seemed to flash back but we as americans don't go after innocent people suicide bombers
746.4,751.17, target the innocent weigall after military targets only
751.17,757.92, sure they might say there might be some collateral damage but we don't aim for the innocent like terraces to
758.1,760.26, i understand all of that
760.5,762.84, but i asked that of an arab once
763.11,768.78, i said we as americans don't go after innocence and reveal the part of our history that i had forgotten may be
768.87,771.15, simply chosen different
771.15,772.11, now
772.14,777.21, but it reminded me that we were the ones who were first to target innocence
777.48,779.1, damages done
779.31,780.57, places
780.81,782.97, she and not a
783.48,785.52, innocent people were targeted
785.76,788.64, were killed
789.3,795.0, you see it's so easy to blame others when we should be trying to understand them instead
795.51,804.18, that's what we want to do no not take sides what to understand both sides and especially in this video to understand the plight of the palestinians
804.57,811.14, he seen we often get the media slant that shows us only angry palestinians but i met many of them
811.23,814.86, are christians and they are praying for peace
814.86,822.54, they're asking us to do the same to understand their cries a people who have fifty per cent unemployment
822.78,827.13, an average annual income of only a year
827.61,837.24, people whose lands are being cut in the pieces by pass roads connecting jewish settlement to jewish settlement within palestinian lands
837.69,844.29, cut right through a farmer's land and now he has half his land to grow produce the other half
844.44,867.66, can't even reach it is easier to obstruct peace than it is to promote it and that the that the establishment of these settlements certainly does not help the efforts of those of us who are interested in peace 
867.75,884.46, temper any more they come in with the little mob houses hoboland slowly you know becomes more and more permanent a relay
886.08,904.29, oenopion was so oppressive that in nineteen eighty seven
904.68,907.02, the palestinians rebelled
907.02,909.72, the rebellion is called into fate
909.9,919.74, a word you probably read in the newspapers in arabic it means uprising or rebellion and i went on from nineteen eighty seven to and the israeli
919.8,922.08, to it was so harsh
922.35,923.61, so much was
923.67,929.43, violence was going on that under the pressure of the international community and especially the united states
929.64,930.39, the
930.57,947.34, a government began to negotiate with the palestinian leadership they signed the two agreements in nineteen ninety three and nineteen ninety five the first and second slope agreement the principal was that israel would be willing to give back land for peace
947.82,969.18, a gentleman mister arber chairman of the executive council of the palestine liberation organization his excellency it tobe prime minister of israel the president of the united states the palatial gobernacion wet to the streets
969.84,973.14, flowers to those at soldiers and give them and
973.26,976.68, they were so happy dancing in the face because they thought
977.49,981.39, there is an end of about years of violence
982.08,983.7, he realized
984.54,986.04, all
986.04,991.77, i continued to confiscate palestinian land and bilocation them
992.37,995.16, how can you make peace with one hand
995.28,997.53, the other hand
997.95,999.48, that does not base
999.6,1008.12, so that gratification in the mind of palestinians a metellus rate that what the problem was as that
1008.21,1019.01, who are in power in israel the lion the right wing of the israeli nobiliary and political establishment who were totally against
1019.07,1020.69, palestinian state
1021.05,1038.24, we're in power and so instead of on the ground israel withdrawing and all of that what happened was the number of settlements in that five years eighteen ninety five to two thousand a number of settlements increased from the hundred and forty two hundred ninety
1038.36,1044.03, the number of israeli settlers in east salem and the west bank
1045.26,1062.12, to four hundred thousand because nothing was accomplished the second in the father unfortunately it became very violent and i hate the militancy of the interface it brought more problems on the palestinian and brought good for them
1062.45,1075.11, many times we have a lift of pointed here antiochian who has ever been involved and fighting just cool centisol the good bullets
1075.17,1080.18, i the good face had proved so i removed in wanton
1080.27,1092.24, but even in throwing stones you are here to one he had dragged me to the emissary to a soldier what can her disorder
1092.72,1093.86, think
1094.4,1096.23, should the child
1096.56,1100.31, life i mention all the billets
1101.54,1105.59, this is this is i think it's a government or 
1106.22,1108.08, it's organized her
1108.44,1114.83, when we talk about are we as evangelical christians see two kinds of terror
1115.34,1118.79, we see a palestinian
1119.09,1127.91, suicide bah may go and blow up a bus and kill the people there and certainly we say the sister that we cannot imitate
1128.18,1130.28, for us the greater terror
1130.55,1134.57, when is he as go with a pathankote
1134.78,1142.88, they go to a refugee camps and ruffling asta or in hebron or enables and kill innocent people
1143.12,1146.45, because the slaves have more power to control
1146.66,1172.76, they are the bigger and they are the ones on top they can come to what they do palestinians they are desperate they are not in control of what they can do i believe this most of the palestinians or peace seeking his loving people we would like to encourage this segment of the population while condemning like all the rest of the world any teresa
1173.09,1176.81, i must tell you sportively that they don't see
1176.9,1191.57, a picture a man with all the things that we do and thou are miles i believe it is the self defence amaterasuan like antoinette manor
1191.9,1208.49, the technicalities are these always shot fearing the sigh everything i speak problem for bending in his iverything she packed his name is abatement eight years old
1209.15,1223.16, and what happened to submit for the estrangement face his reconcilement consciences from hebron
1223.25,1282.47, instantly periodical writing back annie says that he was walking the street and allowed for satterthwaites agitator and he got shot in a boat legionaries every day therefor example to day you come to bestow it is surrounded
1283.04,1284.21, all
1284.45,1288.41, percent of the population of berlin cannot get out
1288.86,1295.85, the people of bethlehem useless they cannot drive more than six kilometers
1296.24,1333.05, it is simply anywhere in the united states will the people cannot drive six colonial so we are in jail the whole population opisthotonos coroneting to go through the crack poetisches
1336.59,1338.12, get the wise
1338.51,1341.0, the palestinians in gets
1341.36,1349.91, just like jesus to living yet unfortunately they've never enlivened that the lesson of history that gates
1350.12,1351.77, eventually
1351.86,1353.66, one shattered
1354.44,1367.43, so this obviously israel tries to justify the building of the wall and most people don't know what really happen here so they think that israel is justified
1367.58,1377.03, like president bushes saying because you know is reason after its own security while i say that the walls are just 
1377.24,1381.08, he just reflections of the walls that are in the human mind
1381.59,1382.91, and
1382.91,1390.44, real way to bring down the walls is to build is to bring down the walls of the fear
1390.8,1393.5, fear and mistrust and anger
1393.53,1426.2, constantly frightened on looking to alcides fortenberry you know bombers gonionotus with me i don't look i might be extreme but i think that there is no arab who is not ready to collide
1426.95,1431.63, he
1432.68,1437.63, he
1437.9,1451.7, suicide bombers are scary thought people who find life so cheap that a person sacrifices his very own body as a living explosive
1452.3,1458.6, it was in the is that all of this began to heat up after the ylocos when peace was promised
1458.81,1461.81, land was to be traded for peace
1461.99,1466.25, israel would give land to the palestinians in the west bank
1466.49,1475.49, remove the weight of occupation and in exchange the palestinians were to give peace stop the bombing stopped the rocks stop the anger
1476.33,1485.33, it was a great upon but instead of peace more land was confiscated for jewish housing and by passers were built to connect them together
1485.93,1488.0, and then the second in the father
1488.0,1490.97, uprising the desperation
1491.48,1493.43, because of promises that were made
1493.73,1494.99, never kept
1495.62,1508.4, so aside bombings are never condoned but it would do as well to understand the rational behind suicide bombing it might come from extremists with ideological differences
1508.58,1513.38, i also come from desperate people who have nothing left
1514.7,1524.15, my people maninthestreet the hole she saltatio constitute and the maasaun
1524.39,1530.72, this is something the amontillado which suffice at the suicide under
1532.01,1533.69, ligature
1535.52,1543.35, you put anybody in a box and you keep crunching the box down and they're going to eventually turn into violence
1543.56,1558.89, they see no hope and dialogue they see no support from the international world in the way they needed they live in a bad situation so this is their reaction i don't condone it i don't think it's a good thing violence wise i don't think the killing of any human being should be anybody should condone it
1559.07,1561.95, but when you look at it from their perspective
1562.4,1568.55, different this is a festering sore in the eyes of
1568.91,1584.09, muslim world in general and especially arab muslim world because we don't hear a lot of what's happening on the ground the kind of thing i've been telling you because it doesn't get in harnessers but through a gazer and all the rest they see voluminous
1584.48,1613.67, and we're to counts of the horrible problem not just of the suicide attackers but conditions in the west bank and the gaza strip and it makes the recruiting by the extremists of terrorists
1614.21,1681.41, we're in a mare refugee camp in romola papalist in where many many live here in pretty squalid conditions but they have hope in their hearts and that's what we want to give to them as well hope for a fresh future i think a lot of them would say we had had plenty of yesterday's were looking for a new tomorrow golloptious people living here the hesitation when you say refutations maintainer descendants so these people probably kicked out of their houses and then it was bulbocodium runaway and terraced
1681.89,1700.16, all these organizations these places so often but themometer and unartistic sixty years is oninterestin and say i mean and
1700.22,1706.79, under the rod of attention left dissenter house a rioter has
1707.12,1718.82, maintenon way they can go is up so ever they want to go there's no expounding it in one
1719.48,1720.68, he
1722.93,1786.29, this is my patron the mico is also the address the settlement called italicization that really foresters we disposed an army teacher and his job is to guard this from people annapolitans that occasionally shoot tester vehicles of a rotary patrols you can say that village of there that's bitin the palestinian villages is all in the land when the allotted to within three hundred meters three hundred yards but this road asininities on this side or on that side and very often and this is pleasanter parts of the west bank sellers and opened fire or attack painstaking the lips i answer as one of the last form another
1786.65,1788.18, enter agreements
1788.18,1792.8, it stated that israel would have the right to build roads to the settlements
1793.16,1807.92, right from the beginning israel started and throughout that five years they built almost two hundred miles of what they call by pass road those bypass roads went from these raised laments into israel and from settlement to settlement
1808.01,1890.36, and they were security roads so there were not only well paved and could try one and cargadores they had security zones on each side in which no palestinian could own land or come near and since they ran all over the west bank they chopped the west bank up into isolated little segments because nobody could cross those roads or go on them festooning one thessalonians editorials
1890.45,1899.72, he throwed his semiannual my ear not at the meshes began
1899.81,1902.78, with the gun she's beating
1903.26,1962.9, he does something that it bewildered her and majestical to anything because you the home and not a latinist a beauteous how did they get my headstone and do you see what was you americans injustices weltering eaton and otaheitan to feminine intercontinental we should hear imagine how old is your safeties old inalienable whose letters who therein was inside the house was coming to the sootiest you of terrorism or if they just wanted this alacriously lot
1963.38,1975.14, a good disseminating through so must be mistaken though he sold my heart to be imagined
1975.26,1984.26, this is a good for hesitation for the minster the monforte look for or
1984.8,2000.73, so they did they move in settlers settlement people came in the september and now i can go to my my eyes contestant now in the duntorme to be again
2001.66,2010.18, will they ever god and us that can endure us christians and muslims
2010.18,2012.58, all called the people of the book
2012.76,2018.7, all the sentiments of abraham each one claiming that their scriptures are the right ones
2019.24,2026.38, who is really right who was just and who was unjust because there's conflict on all sides
2026.41,2029.74, all claim that their scriptures teach peace
2030.22,2035.26, where is the solution to this conflict that is continued for years and years
2035.71,2038.62, is there any hope there are certain
2038.92,2046.06, scriptures or scripture passages that unless one is very careful in interpreting
2046.39,2049.69, they might conclude that god is is
2049.81,2052.87, ah and yet the
2052.93,2059.68, heart of the message of the bible at least the way we received that message through jesus christ
2059.74,2062.62, that god loves all people equally
2062.65,2086.38, is not wise the people control israel live in within the ideology of extreme zionism which like unfortunately some my christian brothers to the right of me who are very fundamentalist in their interpretation of the bible they take the promises god gave to abraham and the israelites years ago as absolutely literal and therefore
2086.41,2094.15, and therefore fell my christian friends say is well has the right to the land because cotabato them three thousand years ago
2094.48,2109.66, discussion over i don't fight them on that interpretation because you know that will go on forever you know and we have a different interpretations i don't believe that a dog i have a different view of the relationship with the old testament and new testament what i say to them is okay
2110.14,2111.94, let me grant you that promise
2111.94,2114.82, okay you know your bible well
2115.54,2137.65, you know what the old testament law had to say about what righteousness and justice is you know what the prophets had to say about what righteousness and justice is bring about justice in the gate which was of course neale testament world the place where the court held forth you know we could cite amiss we could cite jermicide seawold say jesus
2137.68,2163.0, in the light of those people a teachings how should god's people have treated those who inhabited their land when they came back to it should they be doing what they're doing to day they listened to those words of the old testament story that says god has given you this land but they forget about the fact
2163.39,2165.31, the text also says
2165.31,2169.39, be very careful how you treat a resident alien
2169.39,2198.73, and where that passage and is not just once is repeated three times and the prophet's pick that up as well for you were resident aliens and you know the heart the essential being and here it's the metis you know the essential being of anomalies for you were aliens in the land of egypt but that seems to have just been urged forgotten in this issue of land once again we were up against the basic problems of the human heart
2199.54,2205.12, as a director of coronation i always tell my people
2205.57,2209.74, it's very easy to revenge
2210.52,2212.5, forget
2213.64,2218.2, forgiveness is a valuable and you have to know how to do it
2219.19,2222.67, the second point is that
2223.15,2224.44, first
2224.53,2227.38, in heaven being
2227.92,2229.87, that is beside
2230.83,2232.54, so what you should do
2232.63,2234.31, explore the good sight
2234.73,2236.92, gold split humanity
2237.16,2238.27, to
2238.54,2240.37, good and evil
2240.37,2242.5, like america
2242.53,2246.25, and the west and israel are the good
2246.25,2260.14, and the muslims the africans are you know everyone else is the evil they don't think of the arabs and the muslims as any man they don't have to be animated
2261.16,2283.99, god so loved the world that includes the arabic world that inclosed the islamic world that includes the palestinian and if god could love the world why not cross love the world jesus in quoting chapter sixty one of the bookies stood up one day in the temple and said
2284.02,2289.66, spirit of the lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the good news to the poor
2289.96,2292.48, set at liberty those who were captive
2292.72,2295.6, sight to the blind and then he said this
2295.9,2297.4, freedom
2297.49,2299.11, those that are oppressed
2299.17,2301.15, proclaim god's favor
2301.51,2303.16, that was his assignment
2303.19,2306.28, the father given him to as he came to this world
2306.43,2308.17, one of the aspects is
2308.74,2314.32, help those that are oppressed and to proclaim god's favor to mankind
2315.04,2319.15, we are wonderful allies with israel will always be
2319.36,2322.93, also remember that firstly we are ambassadors
2323.35,2324.22, it
2324.49,2326.74, those that are oppressed
2326.92,2331.24, that's why he wanted to do this video of people that are oppressed
2331.42,2367.87, why we wanted to visit those that are struggling so that we can help them most of the time you see palestinians their carrying coffins that's the hams it's a riot the stone throwing which been a car blown up that's what you know palestinians to be i know them to be human beings i know them to be mothers fathers sons daughters people just like every hawaiian every french ship roger an every one around the world the same family structure the same elements but what do they want that we have americans have that they don't have normal life he must do all that we can
2368.02,2369.49, close the gap
2369.88,2374.98, israel and the arab states and between israelis and palestinians
2375.31,2376.96, time is come
2377.02,2387.58, put an end to arab israeli conflict repartee were friendly were not friendly
2389.14,2391.24, we have no right
2392.89,2398.32, to dictate through a responsible action or menominees
2398.83,2402.55, future of our children and the children children
2403.6,2405.67, been enough to 
2406.21,2410.26, in a waste
2412.81,2414.31, in that
2414.43,2415.75, we
2416.77,2424.78, plays beyond ourselves our people that is where the of them under the sun
2425.47,2428.14, descendants of the children of their land
2428.29,2431.68, we don't need to give hope to the jewish people
2431.74,2436.18, storms and in shrines and in a piece of property
2436.39,2443.5, we get the whole forces on the one who loved them and die on the cross for them
2444.67,2455.41, a caustic always be home without pooping the lot always no hope is very important for every christian if we are christians woe
2455.44,2467.26, hope that what you have now intent on this well after nearly the hope in the lord and hoping that one day peccadillos interested in real estate
2467.56,2473.47, god is interested in his work in a horse when jesus was asked where is the kingdom of god
2474.04,2482.11, response the king the god is not in jerusalem and is not injure the kingdom of god is within your heart
2482.92,2485.41, focus on real estate
2485.44,2487.27, but in his violence
2487.6,2492.61, ingatherings bloodshed brings anger
2493.15,2496.78, focus on the kingdom of god brings reconciliation
2497.2,2499.45, and therefore i would say
2499.72,2506.38, we ask christians not encourage the jewish people to possess a piece of land
2506.83,2520.81, encourage them to make peace let god decide who the land belong to now sometimes and not taking sides at leaves you sort of in a dilemma i think i think joshaway have
2521.41,2524.77, experience that and the book of josh with chapter five
2525.37,2532.24, she near jericho and there was a man in front of him with a sword
2532.45,2533.62, draw
2534.01,2551.44, joshua wanting to know what side took said to him immediately what side are you on aleme read it to you it says now it came about when josh was by jericho that behold the man was standing opposite him with a sword drawn in his hand
2551.62,2553.45, joshua went to him and said
2553.51,2561.76, for us or against us what i do you on and he said no as quite an interesting answer is that
2561.88,2564.22, for against us the answer is
2565.78,2570.94, rather i indeed come now as a captain of the hosts of the lord
2571.18,2578.59, joshua fell on his face and bowed down and said what has my lord to say to a servant
2579.04,2589.99, and the captain of the lord's host said to joshua removed the sandals from your feet for the place where your standing is holy and josh would did so
2590.2,2601.78, sometimes we ask god what side you are and the lord says no less with the angel said in other words i'm not taking sides
2601.81,2610.99, any among the lords side joshua bowed down and the angel continued and said take off your shoes for this is holy ground
2611.23,2632.62, words the lord is saying the posture of taking god's side not man's either or but taking god's side that's the holiest ground there is one not the most popular but that's what jesus did he came to help the oppressed not to take it he just came to help the oppressed and to be on god's side and that
2632.77,2722.98, is the holiest place of all
