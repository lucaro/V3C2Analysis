5.1,17.07, it is a voice what i'm trying to suggest though is that this also some initial carpetings are lineally exclusive
17.82,23.43, he has got for incapacitated to you for example that the word woman
24.06,30.63, be used in eradicates to me rabidity particular and transmutes
31.77,39.09, that's not about whether not fit in terms of the category or not because it precisely about what they had worn
41.34,44.43, one insurrection you may be liminal
44.43,48.9, another interpretation we were right radiant
50.79,53.73, the word is the man
54.45,56.64, the dust is that
57.6,67.83, sometimes i initiative in it sometimes is the assumption of a singular interpretation of the categories
68.46,69.96, irritation
71.43,75.24, on that interpretation when he comes coloration
75.3,78.96, he had biathanatos
81.75,86.64, was i think that this other possibilities of feminality
86.73,92.49, harley that i mean being caught on his face in which a beateree
93.51,97.17, two different ways your kind of in between the two deputations
98.1,99.87, so for example
100.14,102.54, with you know
104.4,109.74, a part of the lake you know and i softly but it is going to go ahead with it
109.8,112.86, part of a culture with a miserable
112.86,117.9, using words in the understanding more or less a seemilar ways
117.93,122.16, stand in a prother people who are ledwith those words
122.16,125.1, he using ethiopics and therefore
125.19,130.74, disputation with his stature than their interpreting us in general was
132.81,139.47, i tattooed it now began you know all hyaenodon
140.16,144.18, one interpretation of that expression oh so you really mean
145.23,147.78, say no newman
147.87,149.82, on a hot about
149.97,151.74, you really mean
153.24,156.18, newman
159.33,162.0, expression means different things
162.81,169.11, so maybe i do alter or some contract to culture in name
169.14,171.6, soissons
171.87,174.87, some call it means something also together
176.07,180.81, times it may mean both at once in the east were caught in between the interpretations
183.45,192.75, at that time between mister interpretation of multi meanings as well but i envy thertainly
192.9,201.18, we argue with this is not a point that i could make no i suspect that this is more what one is ovine
202.02,205.47, i think that he also landed there were as well
206.4,211.14, i beforehand
211.29,214.71, had worthily i emphasize more
215.25,223.08, at least to be assumptions about sort of institutions although sometimes not as not society in the leather
225.0,226.68, he was a
226.77,231.3, you do and you do see the condition allbright out in
234.42,243.99, segerteribus because because i think i think the business willibert that we don't have this dimensional
246.3,255.69, we just assumed the shape do with it it was to manhood the seminoles as the chance people
255.99,259.35, are punished because they follow in the border
262.08,266.07, for their inveterate the categories
266.43,271.17, he is timorous of former sophisticated account than that
271.62,273.12, similar
273.45,276.27, in the sense that it assumes interpretation
278.07,281.28, so that the individual
282.24,284.43, services
286.14,291.39, being candramarte the finer again
293.22,295.86, a part of the issue the issue is how
296.37,299.43, how this person has been called and what those words mean
300.99,304.2, rosas yeast
305.31,309.93, you don't quite into the finer
310.26,312.87, you know many men are really women
313.32,319.38, actually not what i mean i mean that i really did but i have to be transacted
321.57,324.78, assumption is good man actually
324.9,340.38, position a person as it were beyond the binary or problematically with regard to the finery regardless of their own interpretation and important merriless of the resistant practices of armadale
340.41,345.69, existing culture where by individuals how this those sacrifice of
345.75,349.89, naming and giving those words meanings eminent
350.94,357.45, i mention inserting in franangursfors
357.93,365.22, the liegeois of resisted culture i mean you mentioned the idea of amity
365.91,368.49, also
368.85,372.93, scarborough and
372.96,379.71, what would constitute an actual culture that can then be resisted half of action
379.77,383.91, i guess the question as an lasthenes of such stature in place
385.98,389.76, and so also for your question is it you know
391.02,393.78, what makes a culture gentle one man
394.29,396.24, existing culture
396.54,403.86, and this is to this issue hardening said of madame repression of push and push back
403.92,406.89, for to me and i see that it all
406.95,409.71, we have a culture
409.95,412.53, tension was iseult
415.17,417.12, one
417.21,421.62, so how do you i mean how do you solidify that
421.62,433.23, you know this is why the laciadae other and one or talbot chaises and transactions of that tense
433.29,440.88, beauharnais to be aimed at i referred at the further
442.53,444.9, emotionally words to
446.13,448.08, the more technical
449.94,451.95, in this area
454.92,456.39, but
456.51,462.42, when you know that i mean to resemble in terms of time you can die
462.48,466.56, simonetti
466.74,473.55, fanatical treated nisbet to proportion eminence
475.68,481.53, he treated institution it how you libertarians forms 
484.38,486.0, and so
487.98,495.66, then you have evidence that there is a kind of like this something going on right here in whether
497.82,501.27, the abilene occurring in one misery
501.51,505.17, trevithick is more complicated
505.35,507.96, how against noticed by
509.46,513.81, gestures he saw some thirty
514.2,517.95, in our short
519.03,520.47, only show up
521.07,523.65, soon the resistant poltroons
524.13,526.35, besides
527.07,529.2, i think that to be credible
530.19,533.28, a marked difference from 
533.82,536.79, together godparents
537.0,540.9, think
541.17,546.27, i guess that's the descendent some characteristics of wonderful trees like so
546.48,555.48, i guess it is the question is the question what is the first for i know the domtiferous down resistance pushing
555.99,558.36, you know says
558.36,563.01, but i mean it orientally
563.28,565.41, note
565.53,569.31, culture i mean i been made to taste occur by atypical
569.58,579.33, i think there is a good description you know here is the artist should be the case in what what is that insistently to the
579.39,582.69, the tiniest
583.86,588.57, i don't know what to say as utility
589.53,596.01, following that ever the oppression of resistance
596.91,598.11, i 
600.96,603.66, mister stood up at this as
604.32,609.39, i i want
609.45,614.28, the other cars whether
616.92,618.9, this too
619.02,620.55, he
622.11,629.28, a reason for i think a dominican one is that incident a dog is
629.28,630.6, no post
630.72,632.04, the
632.97,639.84, the essence operatives the is not an help at all because
640.65,643.71, she story about a lot of violence 
645.63,647.85, see
648.12,656.01, we must ourselves which oh i don't know he said teinture its
656.58,659.34, that i mean i think that sometimes it
661.74,665.37, back and going towards something in
665.49,671.88, so what you're going to get in the end though it may be not clarionette tion are not far
672.51,676.77, i mean the difference between pushing against industrial
678.06,684.96, for some include his getting against his stable ristorante
685.08,687.09, that is holy
687.15,690.54, it definitely seems against it is important to
693.93,697.56, i roasting profoundly to personal
700.77,702.75, as
704.37,707.16, he
708.93,711.33, about it
711.45,715.59, maledictions
715.89,720.6, discrimination is worthy like prize
720.93,725.04, teresa
725.04,726.84, so
729.63,731.76, something
733.29,734.19, sure
734.4,736.11, i mean i guess i mean
736.17,737.52, also
737.58,744.42, she authoritativeness isitsoornot the good
746.46,749.73, oratorically seeking
749.91,751.83, you tell intaglio
752.22,754.26, and i guess i do
754.89,759.9, is that antonine and focus on
763.71,767.04, in front of his right away i aristagoras
767.97,775.68, i think a different tricoteuse people who are not love to see the gender system overthrown
775.98,784.02, the mission to the culture beyond yonder and in turn transmits
784.5,786.75, he certainly wouldn't even be
787.32,792.03, direction is at the citoyennes speaking to
792.69,797.34, you know but if everybody is you know up against the wall
797.7,806.31, you say well we're everybody put can get here a while people going to be tucked that exacting up against the wall that possible sort of the end
806.31,811.17, place to colonel to decide for everybody rushed to get away from the warm may
811.62,814.02, probably more like where
814.14,825.09, looks like now that was portable and has a inconsistence situation we not have the wherewithal to about
826.08,827.49, it would be
830.34,831.57, and
831.81,836.13, the sinlessness 
836.4,842.31, like washington
842.67,855.24, it is aristotelian carronnieres
856.65,860.7, originally
860.82,862.11, but
862.44,863.91, i don't know 
864.09,868.29, so recognition 
872.94,875.85, socrates
