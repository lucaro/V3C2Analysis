0.03,7.41, a body a thanks for coming early in the morning thank you to the committee inviting me certainly a privilege to be here
7.41,30.39, i work in a team a place book co created solutions and basically our job is to try to help the world's leading brands and agencies on the sand social design understand social behavior the basic tenants of social behavior when the sun visits that are happening in the world around the movement towards the idea of social mobile antinomian tureshi that we see
30.48,44.46, so i disallows guys what i want to be through the morning is basically things that i've learned kind of things we figured out or picked up mostly through making a ton of the stakes along the way a basically degustation patterns at a hope
44.49,50.85, refrain think about social experiences and captain of design better things
50.85,52.32, so
52.5,55.17, by talbot to
56.88,58.89, might have a flicker 
63.18,68.55, then to work i'm going to retook it a solid
71.37,74.13, and i not to stand behind the podium
75.21,78.6, small right
79.08,84.42, walk around a lot orientation
86.94,92.37, all right i for so two things
92.43,96.63, those you guys he tricoteuse i'm getting deep pretty fast
96.87,102.36, this basically to his too true to me about a humanity
103.44,105.27, for my 
105.6,122.67, the first that people want to feel unique right too for everybody here you want to feel it you be unique place in the world that you're different that your special you're an individual and not being in the world is really important thing for you personally and for the people that you interact with
123.12,130.92, the second thing is that people want to feel connected at their connected to something larger the part of a meaningful group
131.52,135.42, they do things a comber
137.34,160.47, both of these things one a few unique and personal i want to feel connect something deeper something more meaningful and these two things drive a lot of the ways in which we think about designing social experiences been able to feel unique and project that to the world and being part of a group are interocean size but feel your connected to the rest of the seven billion people on earth
161.37,166.98, so one of the most common questions that i get used as helpers and the social thing
167.07,173.67, you know i use the word social morning i talk about social experiences and social design but i think that's going to go away because
173.76,186.6, social behavior in the abstract is actually pretty weird right it's not like we go you know we're talking to friends in organizing a party for the weekend and say hey you know that a good part in fighting ataunto people coming we don't turn to them and say he can you make it social
186.87,204.15, that's not what we say i hope yet that is what the brief we get say that is a type of conversations that we have in designed on design meetings a second in that i got assailed i make people share my stuff right sharing in a big deal and again
204.15,212.91, sharing as a weird word like sharing is a means to an end and nobody turned to each other and says i what you doing last night and the turns i was sharing
213.06,218.88, nobody says that yet that is the way we describe these things there the kind of predominant things that we talk about
220.5,239.16, idea that social behavior is actually inherent in all of us in a soul fundamental the humanity that this term is going to go away or the social war would be the web social business will be business so experiences we speak perience i so fundamental to us that actually its changing the structure of the web
239.37,248.07, the last and four years and so on ballooning a face book talking to a lot of start of loving your companies and now i talked a lot of people who are building our platform
248.16,256.53, you can see the shift it's really really huge it's moving away from this world of this kind of bath a period in it to call it for the web which is content right
256.56,264.99, the idea of people go on line you know look at different types of contents all in together we have things like information architecture and fragrant how it works
265.02,269.64, that's basically disappearing i certainly will disherit next few years
269.85,296.25, and toward something that looks much more like that which is basically every time your served better for that's in a phone in an art or a website every single time it'll be personalized and already happening to huge degree and people don't even realize it it most he was on even realize that like what you see and godless different other people see isaac book experiences completely different to other people section friends they follow in like different things
296.31,299.46, basically every time you would bring with you your friends
299.64,309.21, interest on your friends interests and you decide whether or not you're going to share a data or whatever company or interacting with and it will totally change the experience
310.02,329.19, big deal for us i think in this industry and interaction design as understanding that we are no longer designing destinations right that is how i think about things that's not the way to think about the future were designing systems were designing things agree content in real time by totally different ciawani about stuff
329.76,338.46, it is basely ow we think about face book i i talk to people who are designing face book and building face book the last thing you'll hear it some oderit as a website
338.61,339.87, not a website
339.93,341.16, a system
341.31,352.71, and it looks like this and thankfully and i expect your sin eternalize their isbas cally you were the details is basic what a white board for a people but i'm tintoretto is still in
352.71,372.33, all these different components of scythes meditate alison to all intact with each other it's a system when you do one thing over here things happen over here and all at times were designing to fortifie out oh then if rentings that are a play at the same time a very different in signing any kind of destination a kind of linear sequence through it
374.13,398.16, social a second term that i kind of hate tinchang was perceptions of his mobile to montmesly when you talk with your mobile you very quickly get into the things about like tablets versus fons versus screen size resolution gestures you know how do we make this like people can swipe the wayside that way new interaction patterns for for a screen a kind of mobilising
398.31,408.51, thinking about technology as a prime way of thing but mobile is the wrong path and actor often in a kind of deep corner the first when is much much bigger things happening
408.9,421.59, and the best we had to cut the scribe is big change in mobile and is to steal and knowledge from benares in the bastarnae who heard say that a wet went out her sago and imbecile and sighed after it
422.19,443.85, basically described the mobile is basically a very similar to the time when a car was invented it at the time you know people are little looking for singling it's not a horse like i know that much i wis it by so they were obsessing about his steam going off to sementini the other designating how works had is it yet from a bee without like you know not a horse
444.21,453.3, a very similar we are obsessed or at the technology but new types of devices i phone fives is six an android likely deep into the technology
453.42,460.56, there are way bigger things happening but some mobile in many ways will do to our society what he cared
461.1,471.15, car completely changed how we live but suburbia did not exist before the car was invented a toltecans of benoic of neighborhoods and people attracting oother
471.99,486.45, carlsen to commerce a completely changed the economics of buying and selling a biased eny people could basically build big huge warehouses on the edge of town pocketfull of stuff for way cheaper than be in the centre town nobody out
486.6,495.36, and before a suddenly local retailers you know local business man business people beating ears through families for generations could no longer compete
495.36,503.07, mobile is going to do the same thing it is going a fundamental change our society in ways we we can't predict an it's goin to fundamental commerce
503.22,506.28, i've no idea how or why and hopeless
506.37,536.22, better than i and will go ahead and make these things what i do know is that if in a world or you can get information in your pocket in a split second about anything any bright who bought this at my friends by it do they like it how much the cost is a cheaper down the road who else bought are they cool are they like me i want to aspire to be like them is a thing tradition as going up as a going down to the clingingness right all these things there like a top my head as a hundred of permutations with questions
536.37,539.49, obtainable decide what by
540.39,547.5, the reader a big deal and it's not about tablets are homes it's by commerce and society
550.74,553.26, to think that our money but mobile is that
553.59,557.91, four billion people on earth have never used the internet
558.12,563.67, we don't think about that we think about our world we all smart phones and superpositions
563.67,568.47, the people in a small arrears will have access to internet
568.83,570.81, they will not know what a mess
570.87,583.47, not know what a kind of windows in type environment is in microsoft or adopting to this change is the reader any big deal mobile has been a toltecans how are global society works
584.22,589.8, deep enough for like a wednesday morning hung over all right
590.16,599.91, a third thing social mobile and the reason i'm talking of these things because i don't think you can talk about designing social experiences what i talking about mobile and information returning information
600.18,606.15, it is also pretty pretty mind blowing the imagination must be published is increasing exponentially
606.15,612.18, so that we think that wikipedia herr over thousands articled attitude every single day
612.36,615.48, all the existing adits to all the existing articles
615.54,631.74, what phones people are publishing more and more stuff all the time where we've been hoisted to what were eating which is a reindeer sainthood on the internet but there are while eating her who were with right or publishing more and more and more content and it's going up exponentially
633.06,646.5, second thing is that we've access all that expense increasing information so you know when i grew up with encyclopedias in my house and you guys had said of cyclopedias right so like all of a parent's bathe and no one ever read them but
646.53,650.04, look in the neighbors called ran and
650.52,664.56, the bandicoot library may be it was the bantoomian that's totally changing right we have all as exponent increasing information and with access to it anywhere take out your phone you can get access to the stuff in real time anywhere in the world
665.07,670.47, you can be in mister forma remote jungle you can be in remote parts of earth
670.62,680.31, bones signals and people can access and this information right so assessing this exponentially increasing information anywhere and any time
681.81,698.01, final thing is that to filter all of this huge massive bulk volume of information people are turning to their friends right were seeing this lots of academics are seeing it i think the reason why is pretty obvious its base wolverton is coldest do
698.01,712.83, thousands of years in society we basically turned to one another to share information as he helped his survive where to plant crops were not to pancras if those guys in the expiator are angry are not friendly oniata tom all these things helped our species survived
713.67,716.01, so people are turning to their friends
716.94,722.22, it gives in the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed
722.85,733.38, i see in the dourdou lifetime probably within our integration we are going to see the biggest changes to society since industrial revolution right this is a really really big deal
733.86,741.87, exciting for you guys exciting for me and as we are very lucky to be livin this period of time we have an amazing opportunity in front of us
742.47,750.45, the future that i think is already here is a narrow of information about any one in anything available anywhere at any time
750.57,753.15, and it's ours to kind of aside what to do with it
753.75,758.61, so it was social design a kind of the big picture i mean i would social design
758.79,777.69, you can make social sign ready complicated are really simple and i've decided to make a really simple like my life easier may because insight lazy but because its pragmatic but you can get big down i have the many times in social science conversations really deep pretty academic conversations but things like identity and relationships and so on
777.69,783.48, you can make it really simple that you go in design and build stuff and put it out in the world and see if it works and it doesn't change it
783.63,785.79, the frame that i use me
786.03,787.83, and every one
789.45,807.12, basically means identity groups and connections by the first thing me as an everyone because that her real people talk i give to talkee about their sense of self the one even use a term sense of self to look at you like the assiduous or identity but identity is a very weird words to most people
807.15,814.29, the men and their life and themselves and their life and what they care about so i like the spring work a lot
814.53,818.7, basically means help people tell the story of their lives
818.7,820.53, everybody wants to do this
821.31,834.18, means help people build relationships with people that they know if you ask atelier a lot effront countries in the world in asia in the us in europe with all generations young people a people
834.66,842.82, if you ask any one what is the most important thing in your life almost every single person regardless of age culture gender will say my closest friends and family
842.94,846.93, that is the universal truth that humanity to help people do that
847.11,851.79, and a third thing is every one help people connect with new people
852.24,860.55, you look at all the social products that are in existence today the ones that are successful the either do tipity do water two of these things really really well
860.64,871.71, few few of them do all three very well because suddenly you're into a lot of complexity tyneside for people's sense himself plescop plus connect what i odinwald that complicated quickly
872.46,881.76, i mean i can basically i won't stop here i could stop here like this to me if you can design against these three things you will start seeing things getting better fast
881.79,890.4, if you're not a kind of bill so experiences and not addressing any of these three things i think you're going to find it very hard to see growth an engagement
891.72,897.0, into these and literati and a hottentot and a case asking creations about this
897.3,927.66, so basically this kind of one pattern about identity i think it's a lot but one three important people of a sense of personal identity and sense of social identity right things are different so personal identity for makes us feel unique by costizan personalization allseeing society is what makes us feel same as others rightly part of a community part of a group and remember the paper oborn but not born when utility there born would have very strong social identity into a certain society which specific values
927.81,931.29, and so gently drives so much of our behavior
931.29,935.4, these two things are different and designing for them as different soberness
935.55,944.28, it is meesery one has the unique relationship with every single person in the world with a closer to some people in others is pretty obvious
944.64,952.2, an inner circle loyal to most people it typically have about five people that they would offer to the private circle of trust and then
952.41,957.42, i say this but every one talks about robert dinero movies with circles of trusts but
957.54,963.39, we basically circle five people it's people who we would go to paeony people who we trust really deeply
964.32,967.89, a bigger circle of close friends and family
968.16,971.4, it's not that big it's typically fifteen
971.43,974.4, people right pretty still pretty small
974.88,978.84, interesting at me what i most investing things because pensively is that
978.93,981.3, of those people are incredibly similar
981.3,993.09, this is called the alarmed you guys of studied him awfully honestis principles and social science mytaben observed across many different types of environments cultures societies and so on
993.45,1042.8, incredibly profound yet basically means that when we go out and talk to people we end up being friends with people like ourselves and at messines university when you go the university we friends at sixty thousand people it with the conversation to always have what every one same entered on before by the way me describing all the stuff makes you feel centerward later when you go and talk to new people but sorry about that right but you will say things like hay you know i'm paul and from ireland you know i live in a francisco just go back to ireland but oh you know where you from where you grew up you know where you go to school oh do unschool there i know somebody there by stray you ought to the basic should then living for common grand it was now have common grandissme it's really easy to talk to bytonians
1042.92,1062.42, you don't things in common with people it's really hard right you start going like irreligion where that is where is ireland is it in the united king then i noreen know right and like a gets off word kindly or like o in a god there's jonathan seen these real friend mine boy back in a minute right origo
1062.54,1072.02, you guys know this this happens all day every day right so we end up talking with people that are like us because it was easier to relations from the beginning
1074.09,1096.32, thing about all this if you look at lobito look at people and networks and how we're all connected what's really in testing to me is that were basically many many many small groups all connected together by basically evolutions were hired wired to form groups by his tones and tens of researching gontaut at this
1096.35,1118.82, thing is that these groups are independent right so my family in stovall of you guys are probably the bad for between four and six groups and these groups tippecanoe eight ten people at the most but those groups independent so you know for me for example a ungodly have by family obviously i have in london i have london friends i often dublin i've dublins and i lived in enfranchise and sanfransisky friends
1119.03,1122.63, groups of people although i know all of them do not know each other
1122.93,1140.93, a profound avocations for how messire how content bread and have been acted on another right you know when when my son arise friends see my double friends and don't know who they are we to build in things into into experiences to make it easier popple to interact or if we built ancient is often the case as well you want to
1140.96,1144.11, build things a kind of keep them apart
1144.83,1153.59, these groups are life stage so family he lived somewhere for a while i mean is a pretty cost examples hobbies and so on
1154.73,1166.25, beyond that we have all the reconnected too and you know this is kind of metopes of toyon people in telegrafted rents of a partisan face book friends the use of to day is totally different to my generation
1166.25,1188.42, but we have limits in terms of physiology and how many people we can remember it from most people about five hundred people and an went you go beyond thundering there really awkward experience of walk and street and some one's coming towards you a like oh my dad i know them but i can remember how and treherne ber me and so any too like make a disappearing act super fast right to avoid this embarrassing
1188.42,1192.32, situation rights of people limited to votive hundred
1192.32,1199.94, connections for six groups of four o four ten people a close friend had but fifteen and in a circle of about five
1200.45,1209.51, this is basically what we're designing around this is the foremost people the social construct and queenie perience for them
1210.92,1225.47, so then you wonder how did this come to be right how do we end up in the situation where you know the certain set of friends you don't know each other the fact that we love some people more than others and the fact that some people practice may not even like necessarily but there are reasons why any tenet to them
1225.47,1236.54, this combat and for the most part i came through very light weight conversations right and waited scribe's many light weight interactions over time
1236.66,1255.74, how people get to know each other right it's like i say so we meet on the first time like a better captator me to cut from you back from me back from you like it two way it's very fast if you look at all the conversations that happenchance of commons it's very fast very short like numbers of words you less intent words backandforth backandforth back and forth
1255.83,1269.39, that happy where latin or another you know you guys all know that you when you're at the party and like someone starts talking to you and like the launch into the monologue of like them or even anything that this keep talking and keep talking keep talking like
1269.48,1277.31, so much more going on his part the i don't listen to you any more right to you bill relationship through these many lightweight interactions over time
1277.49,1285.95, this is a really really important idea in terms of design because it is in my experience from looking at all as subsisting designed in social space not what people are doing
1285.95,1313.28, the giving people to tools to make things that are more heavy weight or if they're building experiences for companies special especially i do a lot of work in the broadening in marketing and advertising space now belligerence for bronze the real heavy weight there really headwaters are like but pratolino merci thing people going to get lost in and discover the brand that is to be brilliant and you know and it's most to be in some conscia framework and its like as not have people interact with each other
1313.28,1319.85, not people talk to each other and people aren't going to change like human beings changed very very slowly over thousands of years
1319.91,1326.12, people interact with many litwin in tractions overtime so that to me is a principle you be to be thinking about
1328.58,1337.73, a second thing is when you look at what people talk about it think about how do they talk they talk in terms of many like retractions what they talk about they talk about feelings and not facts
1337.82,1344.0, again this is contrary to a lot of companies a lot of brains especially who want them to talk about facts
1344.12,1359.33, faster or engine is bigger or product has this their product doesn't but these are a factual things does not talk about he would talk with feelings the tolkotins that generate motion reaction visualisation like or anger or surprise
1359.57,1368.0, one of the best examples was if you look at you look at all the things that were shared on face book assaileth most commonly shared item into thousand eleven
1368.06,1384.14, the less in the telescopic a bit and intensive things happened right be soumalain was cut was killed was captured and killed there was all of that happened across northern africa the middle east you look at the top things were shared in face book those things do not feature
1384.2,1400.16, the actual people didn't talk about those you know if you ever wonder why cats are so popular in the internet by this is one are not united this is why is because the genuine emotion reactions for people and that's what people talk about it just the way weird
1400.25,1413.18, the most thing in face book and says in levana about the sanitarian and artisan happened in japan what was shared was nothing factual not like where it was what the initials of fortunate none of that stuff
1413.18,1417.53, he uses this was the before and after photographs
1417.56,1427.13, the teton before the town after like this bridge and ever before bridger after that's what we share the most and the raises because when people saw that they you know went
1427.19,1434.51, cut the hoight like that it was just like oh my god look at that it generated a huge emotional reaction
1434.6,1439.94, people talk about in sentinel to talk about your stuff or while they to interact and engage in your content
1439.97,1444.23, got to be about feelings and spending about emotion and not about facts
1444.74,1449.42, there are exceptions i talk about in generalizations but generally speaking to a feeling
1450.74,1464.09, that was me and as things every one i think of every one in the world were all potentially connected to any one else in the world to hear a lot about this stuff which six trees of separation of the cabin vacant effect contrast in ugus of her of
1465.14,1485.66, we've we've done some studies on this and on faceth that everyone in face over a billion people are connected through about four to four and five other people right so that the getting across the network is actually very easy in one sense in a short number steps it's also very hard because you don't actually know who knows who right aushar to comprehend
1487.04,1503.78, by the way is a huge huge product opportunity connecting with people you don't know that of things in common with you or to a huge huge product opportunity people like fly fishing people have had long concert people believe in god people have been cantiniere widowed people who have twin babies like me
1503.87,1519.17, i need help that he attends it compactly tapeline roundelay softer people like the restaurant right these are all things as lots of people in the world that we could be connected to it as a huge opportunity to connect people by things that they like
1520.82,1526.37, the doing this i think the teaching he successfully is to understand that
1526.43,1536.72, the kind of billion people underneath that is an invisible network not invisible network it's like adobe get from seven billions everyone being acted and four or five or six steps
1536.84,1555.65, because it's an invisible net rounded that met basically invisible network is many groups of small friends connected to other many groups of small friends are lots of small groups all tacked together in this really big web and it's really hard to get her head round is really hard to comprehend it pealing time to really fully anderson and stand at a talk about this
1555.89,1564.62, one example you know taberchant the higher now but an average when i made this hundred and fifty friends as the apertures and face book
1564.95,1569.39, that those people are connected to thousand friends of friends
1569.75,1576.89, connected to over a million these numbers are incredibly conservative whether it's probably attire over a million friends of friends are friends
1577.19,1583.61, just in a couple of steps you all of you are connected to millions and millions of people
1583.67,1594.68, and i tried to visualize this its incredibly hard to visualize because its kind of three dimensional right but if you take your five posts friends i just think about your own life your five closest friends
1595.67,1604.37, you kind of fail to see is that there's james my friend james my friend you incogitative sit together by so we have a bunch of mutual friends university
1604.46,1625.67, friends of mine but like he has his family that i kind o know but don't read on the mat as wedding but he has his friends from this like the sort of city that he lived in he has his friends from work but he has his other independent groups i don't know were only friends to one metre never think about those people right because i don't know them i there's james and there is his group of the people he's closest to
1625.88,1627.53, another friend of mine
1627.71,1629.24, groups of friends
1629.3,1631.34, another there are books of friends
1632.6,1637.79, five closest friends just five and there close groups of friends
1638.24,1642.41, already incomprehensible like i've had to make a total of this thing
1642.68,1646.34, my closest friends and their friends
1647.03,1652.82, this is my closest friends and their friends might be just twenty people in my life and their friends
1652.97,1658.37, we can't understand that it's just too hard right so we need kind of other ways of thinking about it
1659.6,1681.83, the visible network exists it underlies all of the things if you want to think about connecting people and i'll give you tips on a second there are very specific ways to do that because human beings cannot comprehend it he can't expect people to reach out to people i know who to talk to a nobody connect with are looked for people are search for them and find them because they can't see the network too hard
1682.19,1692.78, a sense okay so i in got ready concrete obey seven design tips and then i'll talk a tiny bit of a process and are we have some time for cubina so
1692.9,1694.1, i
1694.22,1699.41, the first one is expressly designed for personal identity or social identity
1699.89,1707.78, you can do both and some products do a reason could dubbo but i think you're usually better served focusing on one
1707.9,1714.86, mine for example there is a spouse supposed to go like a god all right
1715.1,1722.63, you are hard work that's like the best photograph of ever taken of my babies and i've taken a five hundred
1724.85,1726.02, so
1726.71,1736.49, a pretty good job but it's mostly for both but it's mostly but person identity but mostly me telling the story of my life it that is what time in sisal about
1737.54,1743.84, you thanks specific babies for a second i spent a lot of time in the last six months thinking bout design for babies so i pologize
1744.62,1753.62, you are to design a product and that space right if you focus on personal identity you would design something like a product that helps new parents catalogue and share the first year of their baby's life
1753.65,1763.55, that is all about personal lot like what timmins doing i tell how the people tell the story of their life if you folks in so slight entity he would say well actually to be a product of help new parents connect
1763.58,1782.0, advice from each other other new parents little apple feeling a sense of self and importance around a group right society president to thinking at these things and you end up in two different products faces and in a walise a lot is people then go well i do both
1782.03,1799.16, combine them and make it like a thing that had loglike incontinent and base you end up in like horrible and you know complicated conrad no tail what's going on or what is for right and people disingage because the effort required to figure it out his way higher than any benefit they perceived to get from it
1800.93,1829.37, of social identity as is my profile if you like unlike plus write this is not about me telling the story of me going running this is like her you run and so some people in your net work like this is me and undermines the leader board as a competition out of banter writes this is to me as a good idea like a doon't think like i should be going down the person identity route onody really cares if i'm pacing faster than yesterday or to morrow like
1829.61,1834.86, nobody cares about that but they do care about these things because we all go running were all in this together
1835.61,1845.6, the first tip social or personal entity the second one is to show people things that happen common with others which sends dead simple but largest
1845.78,1861.38, this is a really good example so here is me and my brother so basic it's like he mutilates here is things that i don't solotaire thankfully right as may is neale but this is somebody that i had now that we may be able to actuate book or maybe some of em not connect you a friend o friend
1861.56,1884.48, i surface are you guys sure buildings at surface things we have in common then suddenly it's easy for me to talk to them oh you like bombay so club me to love it and like other playing a town like we should go it that is an easy conversation to how when you know somebody like the same same thing as you do and you'll see over in the right here's all the other people we call us to face piled to the space pilot faces very inventive
1884.57,1895.55, i like concinnity in her friends like this cannery three torrents like this were basically surfacing the things of people have in common with others it is incredibly powerful
1895.55,1897.2, in technique
1897.98,1919.43, artois to design a light weight was for people to interact so embarassing many light which interactions over time as tattletale to one another so that's what you should be designing like wight was the obvious example of this is the like button are the common box and face book these things are incredibly successful the like button is phenomenally successful and the reason is because it's so not to and so light weight
1919.43,1922.16, so easy to go yet like
1922.28,1932.9, so easy right and if you think you my proxy when i try and evaluate social design by proxy is always does this happen in the way real world is as something that people would say in the real world
1932.9,1940.82, recall somebody putting her hand up and giving some positive feedback to somebody else while life is a pretty good word because he boylike that as cool
1940.91,1952.91, so like a prayerful common is also pretty powerful and the box is pretty small right at fords small light weight quick things in tractata big giant form fiesole pay right on essay back to your friend
1954.77,1963.44, second example and i like his example a lot because it's from la pointe lays himself christ are chips here in north america
1963.65,1982.91, these guys made a ready successful so design recessional experience and i feel like a bean do i then most people can write because they got people really deeply engaging and crests and a congress so what's interesting is as part of this product that they built they had an idea that button
1982.94,1999.5, as idea here was it was a proud source competition like the nether of lays is called desolator next labor place a recourse and berrington the world and you can get a share the profits right to people kind of pilin make flavors and then they had this idea but
1999.59,2011.53, powerful because it was light weight and it was so natural right we have people making these kind of crazy favors and the reason the people create his favors and the cleats may sieppe cadavers we had like
2013.0,2023.5, mieris i should give you guys we had a bad two million active ushers right about two million people prisoner america created flavors
2023.53,2050.29, that generated hundreds of millions of unique news features like distinguished as the scale was absolutely huge and people did it as was kind of easy it was quick and was fun or a set something about the identity was like i care thinking the back his own or organizing footfall he probably know this very well takes flavor that he made is called last call right taepings he likes making cocktails a lot and so the sentiments identity in any one in egypt he could know oh my god that's
2050.41,2070.63, who is this kind of funny to the bit of ontario joke or you out and then you go identical stories in newspaper by oh my god you would eat that is disgusting right but this is what people talk about and realise are like one gone i would he thought as absolute delicious i would like that i surely guys are looking at these going i would like these prints right now
2071.02,2073.84, very powerful very light with instruction
2074.26,2083.32, so for things to appealing and not facts to earlier on we saw that people care and talk with content that is generating this emotional distortion
2084.1,2097.21, so again you guys think i'm robbed alas here obsessions are stones bedsores are generated by this act that they built and there all lit feelings right it's like marcus created a flavour
2097.24,2110.38, even comments on a flavor a lessened in flavors like these are all kind of generating mistreating reactions around whether or not you decide or what you think that person as a result of these kind of ready weird and runabouts that they created
2111.64,2116.74, he is in seventeen fifty imputations for who to communicate with
2116.98,2127.84, again this is something that sounds real obvious but no people to like people cannot comprehend their network even when you think they can be when you think people should know who to talk to or should know who to invite a hotter add
2127.9,2150.28, on too hard too hard to remember all of you like odalie one of the pretty funny thing i assure exercise her work to google which was to get people to lay out their social network right to the basically one person on apostate that would lay out all the people you know group them and we learned a lot about social and traction and group behavior and how people thought about their social american the real world is possible
2150.28,2154.9, so may time as people would like to laying it all out in a gale thirty minutes into it and be like
2155.02,2156.7, my god i forgot my wife
2156.73,2169.54, right is unlike ritardando the middle litigation but like people forget too hard to comprehend your network it seemed to give people suggestions
2169.75,2177.28, lots of his ample and face book people you may know he is tom somebody you may know that a suggestion you can do you can it
2177.43,2197.47, for a list product here is like a list suggestions he here's a man here you may this list you put those people on it here's what her people we think he should be honored or you know here's a list savouring her friends of yours who run so like you and had the right you can ask them now they're not they're not proprieties or yes i cannot i pretty simple pretty easy but very very powerful
2198.01,2220.3, the sixth thing is to design the feed story first so when i say feed in a specific i guess for face boots new feed but almost every single social product these days seems to have a fleet of some sort rights become a kind of pretty stable design pattern twitter as a feed of penetrativeness it's kind of tea it's of eshara in visual but still a feed of some sort might somnolent ough
2220.6,2237.1, after what we see is especially cause i work with a lot of brown or an agency for buildings and placebo i see on these headway up these ready rich mercifully micro sits like a baseball destinations on face book and varied stop billing destination easily stems
2239.47,2253.3, remember this right basically what we do the first exercise design exercise of created exercise we do with design the story first right because the story is a thing that shows a new feed and that is the thing that most people experience most often
2253.42,2270.79, that is the thing that is to a first experience a thing right here not going to these destinations that you're building that's not that's not had the wabashaw like right its aggregations real time ovations of all these tiny level slipped right in tomato incense that these things are small the short
2270.79,2274.69, because that's how people interact allah other lightweight interaction
2275.23,2286.57, a story first then reverse engineer whatever system he need to make it happen so we will decide the story then figure with the best story is and decide by the wear are not are we can do it a different way
2287.56,2304.24, the story as you know so i basilisked these not hideously was out sketching these you know poets and a rousing night polite potan and to grow like these are the types of stories it that is the best possible story that we want to tell they want to create and will figure out how to make that thing appear
2305.35,2308.86, the seventh last thing is designed the friends experience
2308.89,2321.67, typically you know classic essences in mythology is that we only ever focus on the user a single person right what a prison as at as there that person's experience water gods as designed for that
2321.82,2331.51, that is to me that's actually slightly ridiculous because nobody in this world exists an isolation of other people we are surrounded by other people all day every day
2331.81,2338.86, we should actually thinking about what is okay will is experience prophets paul's friends experience it was their part of it too
2339.01,2350.41, friends are friends experience we actually design these three things in tins and the because it's a system they all impacting each other by which i figured out what the optimistic for
2350.65,2355.24, the friends experience on the friends of friends experience as much as for pause experience
2355.84,2358.24, okay so that a finished up
2359.26,2397.99, as design process all that all too the most of suffolke about a pretty confident then with a lot of research and dated behind it i'm no going out on a limb and montenay something guys at something about you sat with some dope i think as to blaspheme maybe it's just my experience you know i worked as a research or to four years i before that i worked a flow to a bunch of people here from float yet work a flow as well consult in the edition you know like im any researches in the room or people who read love and believe me such i am one of you i'm mistering you my experience of the last
2398.23,2399.97, three or four years
2400.36,2407.23, i don't do research anymore not expand as foliot i know panawe toute tarmac
2407.26,2413.44, so some people in the audience were allowed at this because they were to float this is the diagonals show
2413.62,2422.44, of people right and like talk at talk about it so you know do contextures arch fioriture users need and want and where the gaps are
2422.53,2433.81, stuff prototype it you know specify or a circle not usability testing formative research a front lots of intermediates in along the way and then once more confident in the product we launch it
2434.23,2438.4, put your hand up and be honest with your hand or if you still follow roughly
2438.52,2440.05, type of process
2441.28,2445.3, so i menotti's like at least half room okay
2445.36,2448.3, so this process were pretty well for some things
2448.54,2453.7, tickets right works really well human computer interaction were really well
2453.97,2458.38, in my opinion rollicker
2460.6,2471.79, process does not work well for social design and because the web is evolving to an incorporate all the social experiences to me this will soon become process does not want work while for it design
2472.48,2474.76, tresqu was
2475.03,2490.84, as the web now become more social and being fundamentally built and people you are not going to have human computer interaction even have human to human interaction by people interacting with other people are certainly people interacting with machines or things or people in the process as well
2490.99,2498.13, it is so complex and so settle it is almost impossible in my experience to make meaningful
2498.16,2502.48, conclusions from any type of small qualitative form in research study
2502.54,2513.49, too hard he participated in two complex but the perfect example i have is now to a lot of research we kind of concluded that showing things like four thousand people like this
2513.49,2525.85, value people like if my friends we love it that's good if it's like millions ten million people into the future video that when he got to pursue the middle like for that iron car you know right boathook at day
2526.36,2536.11, does actually impact things people do click more often when those types of numbers are shown like the social proof so everybody kept telling us and capturing some catalina that was valueless to them
2536.14,2540.64, well kilcullen you shift and learn
2540.79,2544.6, i value it does have value right so i think it's incredibly hard
2544.87,2550.36, so this is the process that i based on her hurry up to an inquisitive so
2550.36,2560.02, i forgot all right so basically this is the process this is going to look for you guys like think of lean start up lennoxville very very similar probably not a coincidence
2560.11,2579.52, first of all built a hypothesis there is so much social science each in the world like if you want us to understand identity you have to think about themselves you to do more research there is so much resent the world they're so much research been contributed every single day from social science nobody i can't keep up nobody can right you don't need to do more stuff and assist really really nice
2579.82,2587.53, i understand the social science space on a stand the patterns and things that we already know and build the hypothesis now that fast
2588.13,2591.94, i build a simple product as fast as possible
2593.68,2610.03, last publicly in the world because then it's funny use people's reliant at genesee friends and that is critical you cannot if you build prototypes wire frames and of fate some of the social day you can't get reliable information about that
2610.15,2638.86, oh you know when people suddenly have their real friends and the real content all the stuff but the relationships it's been generated for decades in many cases comes back and like oh i act would not john i'll tell you what i esther to something in a wouldn't i do because actually down those dim and two years ago basilicas match ianito what happened right and like oh okay i get it but you can't you just can't systematic study that stuff so for me it's better to launch it
2639.16,2644.11, people and real friends and then you will learn very very fast whether it works or not
2644.11,2656.77, to me and afraid to do that i quite apart has no user is horsebreaking if your product when you launch it has no users that is not bad that's pretty good the reasons because you can start iterating and learning and real time
2657.25,2662.44, okay so the fourth is to simply measure an irate
2662.77,2673.93, now you can do primary search you can start to research qualitat research understand why but you have what you have how and when you said those paternal kind of divine and set understand why
2674.77,2681.76, the final thing is to build in such a way even push code and push changes into a test and mitigates
2681.82,2685.78, every day by a face book we push code twice a day
2686.23,2694.42, for some ourselves here that is like pretty phenomenal right you need to push coat all the time to make changes all the time
2695.65,2701.14, okay salotto i don know you're tired out that i'm certainly tired
2701.17,2705.55, the repandre who time fortune recommended but
2706.51,2723.79, a unique and connected right those two to be humanity start talk about mobile and social as abstract things it they are not they are fundamental to everything that were creating we have its massive massive volutions been created that is a huge opportunity and also a talent a pretty challenging one
2724.21,2728.98, people tell our story help people but relationships help people make connections
2729.25,2748.72, in this and many lightweight interactions then finally do it really fast at billiards builders at irate to give you an example we did a project recently i got a phone call from one of the one of the guys my team on a sunday he was like he webster's client mollyhawk was like minute they call it was kind of grandfather super intrusting
2748.9,2750.1, he 
2750.31,2753.16, days
2753.43,2775.84, the idea and ship the product and like a is what we shift amazing it's okay for learning we day were learning scouters were consonant amakaken better and better and better and better and better and every successful social product faceable took years to stabilize took years to grow because you can't filtration ships over night economico best friends somebody overnight
2778.15,2799.24, you don't look about secession as i feel really awkward talking about all the time but i iranistan heaton look at it you can talk to me that's my handover the web i love your feedback and otherwise i thank you for listening
