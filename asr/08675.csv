7.5,13.98, he 
14.91,17.58, yes thanks all thievery one
18.48,21.81, alan
21.87,23.97, it's a big room
24.09,59.79, had i it's crazy it seems so long and so short and so so full ones experiences i collected it i and that i connect his amusing so welcome to the panel or the paneless called failing with style i don't like panels particularly so i thought if i do a pension that cannot possibly go wrong as when i did that is what i'm happen it's all part of the plan to notionally sane spectrometer
61.35,63.0, it's none 
64.44,67.38, yes i like
71.16,85.5, no because all part of the canaanite in performance
85.65,88.23, like like them but
90.48,96.48, anything i can detect again then the lieutenant and
101.94,133.23, the initiates very havelok monometer two then i'm number one it was that teaparties ions at this most
133.56,147.36, so pastor the rent and sorry fellata about it i mean it's a case everybody talks about farsistan to fail you know
147.36,159.09, earlier important fairly falling like often suwarora but often it tasted level that we say we frame palantine story of success like a triestine
159.15,162.39, came up with his really brilliant solution that to
162.39,195.39, and so with owllike to take it but beyond that the discussion and talk about actual failure and different types of failure cases of failure i think fail as a lot to do and also facing failure with honesty of course honestly towards yourself on a tuscarora suppliants can be difficult to be honest towards the commercial clamorous about failure and so there's a lot of interesting tension there and i think the biggest tension is we all ask to do cutting a never seen before were all the time and at the same time
195.6,201.63, i really take proper as quantitatis but we cannot feel
201.72,219.0, when you have a big contract and so interesting how to frame her maybe how to run fairlanders
219.03,250.62, when i make the order were seated here so what's proper partner we have pennergate martin what burg the picnic grove at govan salomon of personal sarastro poets and one so without further do undesert like providing a frame and over to westport the first few factories on the first failure
250.86,255.3, is turning it the now to switch to my stream as it on too
256.98,259.35, pressing one
260.04,270.09, this is an anesthetist absolute failure that i have done here
272.94,279.63, a bareheaded
280.05,281.49, that
281.49,296.43, he came orthographical do this but totally i'm i'm ready to fall
302.1,305.19, it
306.99,309.69, everyone this is our life
309.75,314.04, i sees a propellor you never get a cent
314.37,319.71, i did want a merit that's why i did that to a note
319.77,326.76, the funny thing is we actually
327.15,341.79, before he went working as i do you so my presentation this is my very first my second file first one was
342.06,355.11, a lovely display as you is that my presentation is this and i can make an excuse i can say there's a lot of drama his last few days of the last hour or so
355.32,360.45, true but again that's just an excuse but what i really want to go into
360.6,375.93, i i want to show two projects and you can see i'm not totally together here but i will be because i know what i'm going to talk about i want to talk about failure that we've done with two different types of things one was
376.32,381.42, saying yes to a project that we knew early on that we should have not have said yes to
381.84,386.85, sometimes saying no it's hard especially when it's and there's a recession
387.39,395.31, i don't want to say that i'm going to close this first year looking up there it's we're hitting a recession
395.49,401.82, we started to get afraid when we have our own companies and we have mounts to feed and
402.09,411.27, a clan approaches us and they offer a job that we dispel inherently is not a really great idea this particular clan i can't say the name
411.6,416.25, i can say it was a health care ad agency and
416.28,427.65, one thing that i do want to make very clear at this i'm not up here to ram on a agencies actually a history and agencies in the agency world and many ways were
427.92,438.84, the agency has promoted the creativity that were actually part of to day i mean when you really look back in the sands the adage industry is really
438.84,447.96, contributed a lot to the creative world so we're not here to trash and agencies but we all have our own individual experiences and frustrations
448.05,456.48, plenty that i can say with with with at agencies that said so we were proby client and
456.75,459.87, they gave us a job
460.26,473.91, we said yes to fear can make you really kind o make bad decisions and it's really important to be very clear about what it is that you want to do so we said yes to project and the project was
474.6,529.26, this essentially they had data and it was like in a word document it was everything was bad the red flags left and right the consonantal do it and we acadiens well but it was back in the day in flashes still friendly and we started building these grass for them and first we did our own and which i don't have here but this is where they want this is where they kept pushing us and we kept saying yes and yes look at these isometric paragraphs and scaled people at the bottom this is all dynamic so it was all wellenkuppe if you know our home run but what you're not saying ise have a lot of strike out too and that part of being human i think that's really
529.53,569.19, we did this please don't take pictures in widow a camera and i was like to night will be in your blood if you push that so he did this outsetting like the biographer the phones and its wild and we finished the project and it was like oh my god and they were like we love it we want more we want more and the next generation okay when you were getting into and i'm just going to lick tother
569.49,577.65, we new sort of what we were getting into so we're able to push a little bit but it was still very it's fluffy i call this kind of work we
577.95,583.62, that's really what it does so you know it's all in flash again and so we use our skills
583.89,596.88, in many ways i would say our skills were somewhat prostituted and that's a word for this and his bargaining of the magnifying glasses of our heads awful
597.0,608.52, happened in the end with this particular project as we fired the client we went through another project and i kept him proving a little bit and finally i got to the point of not being afraid any more
608.85,616.8, i said no you have some raw data on some very specific and in the end that you have we need analyze that data
616.98,625.23, analyze it for a couple of weeks you're not going to see any visualization at all you're going to hear my recommendations and i'm going to find relationships within that data
625.47,645.51, and i said take it or leave it and i've learned that lesson from this project that said it ever since and it's really done us good in many ways it's bolted but when they take it or leave it paradise
645.57,654.9, it's enough you know we can't do this any more and it was even interesting because the lead the head the owner of that company fired that creative director and came back to us
655.02,677.55, no way i just fired her i still want you and my response is really like that how you're going to respond like i don't agree with that you know it's not like if your kid behaved to slap them you know and that's going to fix a problem that reaction alone was more information of what was wrong i'm going to just very quickly because i this is a second project
677.64,687.66, about a project that many people would say i was very successful for us but at the same time there were plenty of failures with this as well and i don't know if i
687.78,693.9, everyone in her seeing this for many people hate did visualization every drone strike in pakistan
694.29,696.87, and
697.26,701.55, through this place out and then i can tell what was wrong with it
701.58,711.42, did this project in our own time so but every year a year and a half i pichenette pushed all client work back and we say what do we want to work on with something that is going to help us feel
711.72,718.77, fulfil and where we can make all the decisions from beginning to end we do our own research and everything
718.77,721.5, so we did this we had about four weeks to do it
722.31,737.01, i want the first week was intense i was expecting maybe the first day like this or something like that from a like twitter here and the networks we had about the first day
737.01,750.54, by the end of the week it was almost a million we were on aranian news pakistani news i had were living berkeley california so it's activists place you know and people are knocking on our door and it was intense
750.72,763.62, we had so done strikes in a way that people have not seen it before so you see this intensity but still there so many parts of this and i'm so critical about that i want to go in and fix like these roll over for example
763.95,797.25, like we didn't have time to add these high profile target images okay that's fine i can sort of accept that but just the way the information is displayed here or you have the numbers inside the circles there's got to be a point where you just have to say it's okay you know like not necessarily cutting corners but let's get this to a point that we can accept i might be still very critical about it but you you can't just work on it for ever and ever and ever we all met with our own constraint in late
797.52,809.73, it was greatly successful piece and most people probably don't pay attention to that kind of detail we wanted to really get into the granular aspects of this but we knew that going into that would just cost us so much more time to do that
810.24,818.94, that's something that i would also define this is failure in a way these points where you feel like you can't achieve something or not able to get to something
819.39,828.12, you just have to kind of let it go and it was good i mean i'm glad that i did that and it's always there it's interactive so we can always go back and change it
829.71,836.28, no cross your fingers everybody
836.43,842.94, she has me aylight so when more is
843.03,858.63, invited us to participate in this panel i started thinking about yes i can think about many times when i work with martin and the two of us looked at each other and more like what do we do now this is a dead end
858.81,863.19, and we come from a tradition of research so in research
863.25,867.48, expected to fail you know you're going to feel a lot of times because what you're doing
867.51,873.0, no answer there's no right answer you're just discovering stuff
873.63,906.45, the thing i wanted to talk about today is not this kind of your expected to fail failures part of your work it's more the kind of lessons that we have learned that we think of as real favors that we don't want to do again and we try to take those sort of guidelines for the kind for the work that we do today and we hope we don't repeat that there all sorts of different kinds of timber
906.6,912.54, the amount of effort you put on something does not equal that the portance of that thing and i should
913.56,946.47, um i should observe that in your own work so i'll tell you what happened here might man i were invited to give a talk at the piece personal democracy for him in new york and that is a very cool conference that is sort of the leading edge for politics and technology and people who are engaged and we were very excited that they were thinking about it we really rondelet interested in twitter and
946.68,952.11, how different has tags were being used and sort of co opted by different
952.26,962.58, political groups so you had like liberals would you certain pashas conservatives would use other fashion that sort of the visualization that you see here
962.58,1006.83, and we found one thing that we thought was interesting like the haste and p was being used was sort of a pure was one of the purest hashes because it was only being used by democrats but the conservatives were doing this really clever thing where they were using their own ashes but they were also using liberal hasha so it was a mess but the point here is that we created this visualization that was sort of critic it was very complicated to explain it took us a long time we worked on this for a long long time and it was really hard to come up with a story to tell how do you tell the story of the day here
1007.1,1023.6, and were i a key you know we need to give this presentation that's what we have we're going to talk about this meanwhile in the back of armies we had noticed something else on twitter which is that the top trending hashes usually are very very split
1023.66,1050.03, at least they were when we were looking at this between black authors and white authors and like that interesting so maybe will do like a little broth of it and in this is the grafted up doing which was you know a bunch of tashtego the top training has tags you can see the breakdown between black black and white this is from random sampling a
1050.03,1052.34, point here is that this
1052.64,1054.83, a lot more interesting data
1054.89,1062.66, the thing i was showing you before but we spent like i don't know an hour on this versus
1062.66,1065.69, months or weeks on the other
1065.69,1071.75, the thing here and we felt we ideally really needed to present this and
1072.05,1073.37, the black and white
1073.67,1106.4, it was just an after thought in our presentation and that is really bad because this story is a lot more interesting than the other one we were telling so i think the point is now you know one of the things we took from this is really led the garrulous times you get lost on your own efforts to do the best you can
1108.02,1140.54, a different kind of failure so i mean contexture this i'm about to talk about about one of our major projects which is manie i do not consider that project of fader okay i actually really really like many a sabot there are lots of things about many is just like west was talking about the drones strikes there are lots it's a big project there are lots of things that happened in that project that i do think are faders and so this is what i'm going to highlight today so
1140.96,1146.39, putting many eyes on the right and here on the left is a screen that of swivel
1146.42,1156.02, she does not exist any more it was a start up and we didn't even know it existed we were working very very hard on many 
1156.02,1166.01, i mean back couple little bit many eyes are website it exists to the states free any one can go there it's public where anyone can plod data
1166.1,1209.99, create interactive visualizations of this data and share these visualizations with the world so our idea was we want to democratize visualization we don't want it to be things that you need to know what a program to use we want any one to be able to touch the technology so we were working really really hard and putting together this website and at the end of it the end of thousand and six swivel watched we had never heard of civil swivel was at website that did exactly the same thing as many i basically what they wanted was to give you a way of floating data creating grass in charts and sharing it with the world like
1210.11,1217.49, who are these guys what into water to the one she is coming we had no we didn't
1217.49,1237.23, of things happen one is that we were very scared because he like what is the work that were doing here even relevant that this point because someone just launched sort of the same thing it was not the same set of visualization it was not our way of doing things but it was the same idea 
1237.29,1245.51, one thing it made us very very scared the other is that it made us work very fast
1245.75,1260.63, that is the good part it was we launched maniman a half two months after swiping to market the good part is that had swiveled
1260.66,1264.08, i think we would have spent the next six months working on many 
1264.14,1266.12, and we would not be happy
1266.12,1320.75, so that's something to take into consideration is when do you decide that what you have is good enough and just let it go and the forcing function for us was five alone but hopefully we don't need another swivel to make us launch things in the future so that's sort of one of the lessons we took the other lesson for many eyes is a careful about the technology choose so we chose java yes that speaks for itself so that's what you get to day if you use of modern browser is what you get on the right there also whenever i need i want to denominate to go to a rose that can actually deal with job it's very sad but so that's one thing if you are going to build tools to make sure that you are up to date on the technology and you know it's just part of its profit you have to do 
1321.44,1360.17, other lessons that we took from man is this really interesting one which has to do with word so everything you see at the bottom has to do with word and everything you see at the top is many ice now there's a little story here we worked so we work to this day which jonathan fibres to the creator of word jonathan was really interested in his dislike i just want to create the playful thing that will create a clouds better beautiful untired of having techotl awful so that when he had created word
1360.8,1390.5, but he was very smart he did a couple of things that we never thought of on many ice which is he gave people a way of custom sing their words from the decoy could choose colors you could choose your find you could choose if words would gunwalloe horizontal or upside down or whichever way ah and he just gave them enough custom ization that it was both easy to use
1390.53,1405.11, it was also powerful because people felt that what they were creating was something that they owned that they created as opposed to just going to a website and using whatever was there the tools that you had created as a designer
1405.47,1434.75, he was also very clever in that he wanted from the beginning to allow people to print these things that they were creating a whereas in many eyes were like let you know i make sure everything is shareable which i was as he you could very easily bad things and share but we didn't really think we didn't really patent on to printing were talking interactive visualizations sound word just completely took off
1434.9,1460.91, as i'm sure you all know right regular people use it children use it the media uses it is amazing and you have things like all the corvee creating you know there and choose and also things so my lesson there the thing that martin and i kept looking at it thinking very serious heresy about is this notion
1461.06,1464.99, how can you give people just enough
1464.99,1468.26, they feel creative themselves
1468.47,1482.12, they are using tools that's one thing if you're going for you know massive adoption and very very low barriers to entrance the other thing is this notion of delight
1482.24,1490.49, how can you make sure that whatever your you know building is delightful to your uses i think we took a very
1490.52,1505.82, sort of scientific stands with many eyes were like we're going to flow data we're going to show you the value of your data we're going to let you have insight and so it's sort of shows in the way that we approached manister
1505.82,1509.18, so this notion of delight i think is very important one
1509.87,1513.14, finally 
1513.44,1521.93, sometimes you get very close to your visualization then you think your visualization is very very important and you forget that the data
1522.11,1542.9, sometimes is more important than the visualization itself so what are looking at here is not our work this is something that was not athabasca the engraver and it's something that any one can use its own with any one can go to the website and check it out it shows you the popularity of a word in the english language
1543.14,1571.91, over the centuries it's all based on google books data so glisteny one who has the state a set and its awesome because you can see the avenoo language magically when martin joined goblets was just starting they were working on on this project and they we started talking to the group and they were like you know we're thinking about creating in charts would be interested and were like
1572.0,1604.91, maybe let's let us think about this but we never worked out we didn't win in collaborate in the end and part of part of the reason i think though we didn't collaborate with them is we didn't see the point of having a really really special visualization of it's all alice that the data is incredibly powerful and it was incredibly fingal for all sorts of uses academics use is all the time to understand language and language usage and evolution and so
1604.91,1619.79, we were so set on what can you do with this data said to show it and dipping a new way that we forgot that the data itself was extremely powerful so sometimes you know simple is is okay and it's good and it's the way you should go
1620.12,1622.79, have two more things very quickly
1623.45,1638.45, the sun is about placement or that's very dark but basically the stuff on the on the left here is some work that i was doing when i was at the media lad and i was interested in visualizing email and
1639.26,1655.97, i really wanted users use who are very very interested in this because it was personal data it was there data their conversations years worth of archives of conversations but one of the problems with this is that it was never integrated with any email reader
1656.0,1657.11, so
1657.11,1661.79, a sort of a self contained visualization that you had to go use
1661.97,1674.36, separate from your mail and that's a real problem and i think more and more we're starting to integrate visualizations with products i would like to see an more of that because
1674.99,1678.17, really hard when visualization is an after thought
1678.26,1680.6, for something that we do every day
1680.69,1692.42, the more we can integrate and i do think that that is a failure so far in general it's hard to integrate and so this is something that it is very important to us
1692.63,1704.06, visualization on the right is scopus ripples and that is integrated into a product but i have a different complaint which is it's very hard to get to so you know
1704.42,1710.36, being mindful of these things is important and and finally
1711.29,1730.7, i have two very differ visualizations here i don't think that either one is a failure actually i really like both projects the one on the left is of visualization of wikipedia authors the one on the right is the wind map which shows the live wind
1730.82,1740.75, over the use the point when a man here is that martin and i pretty much almost gave up on both of these projects
1740.93,1756.02, they almost never happened because we were struggling so it was so hard to figure out a good way of visualizing the data that we spent literally we had so many iterations that never took us anywhere
1756.26,1757.4, so
1757.61,1764.45, sometimes i just really hard and that is okay just don't give up basically
1764.51,1768.17, that's what i wanted
1775.16,1782.15, you interfering
1782.63,1783.68, again
1786.98,1813.29, rationalists and count up here i'm actually considering if i should did everything in it was going to show you another direction i'm going to give you mix messages and think i show you this quite i really love you cannot prohibit the catastrophe you must surely
1814.67,1818.96, and something that i think that i take really dear to heart which is the idea of
1819.05,1824.09, we're going to be surrounded by catastrophe we're going to be surrounded by failure
1824.21,1860.6, working in this medium which is you know by its nature on stable were working with things that are recently possible and we're going to be surrounded by you know all of these things that can go wrong and we should suit which had surf it like what i suffer to the sort of like hang out on the surcoat and they feel where things are going and they adjust and there's a kind of like an intuition and it's just the patience and that's something that idea and on the flipfield the flip just want to say like it's really
1862.49,1881.81, it's important to say the failure socks like failure really socks and it sochlike how many of you have been in failed relationships waits what failed relationships sockeyes headedness time riding vesenaire a part of yourself that relationship
1882.02,1898.07, and you lose part of yourself right you parlour mental image or idea of the world changes because you you know you are with this person and growing with this person and now you're no longer and you're losing something and that's why you know failure can be so difficult
1899.57,1904.22, now which way do i go left or right 
1904.31,1905.45, but
1905.63,1913.07, catastrophe got it you know okay i'm going to tell a story that based on last night 
1914.03,1965.6, i have this tack that's full of all the stuff this i'm going to superficial this is a letter to and you are from the museum of modern art saying we don't want your drawing i think this you know is a great it's a great this letter's great comparing you know and you thistledown and reinspected last year i had all kinds of you know promptings going wrong it serves crashing and fighting against technology and 
1965.75,1967.58, i
1967.67,1969.14, i think i can talk
1969.14,1998.81, for infinitely about things going wrong but i want to tell a story about my father so i was a stunning abroad and i was in groningen and my family decided to go to paris to his interlard and i met my family in paris and we had this great idea which is that we would rent an apartment and hang out in an apartment and sort of like live in paris for two weeks and on the first day
1998.9,2004.51, my father was coming out of the bath and he slipped and he fell and he broke two of his ribs
2004.72,2013.24, i was thinking a lot about this this morning because i was really like reliving that moment and that's just such a terrible moment you're in a foreign country
2013.69,2018.07, break your ribs you go to the hospital and it's this sort of
2018.58,2076.84, in that you know you you can't do it anything like you can just you live with it and you can't laugh it's like the worst kind of illness because when you last its painful and we were living toothache this this moment and this is really a kind of important moment in my relationship with my father which is we are like you know we get rothenstein home for us flying home and father just starting
2076.84,2096.46, crying like he's like you know it's it's tough it's tough and he's been had been sick he has chronic disease as lupus in sick for a long time but it was like this sort of like major let down of being in you know in this trip and having this thing go wrong and i remember this moment where i put my arm around him
2096.97,2100.51, and i said you know you're better than you've ever been
2100.57,2112.06, sick for a long time in his lotus was in remission i was like you better than you ever been you better than you ever been you better than you ever been and it was that moment in it for us is this moment were like
2112.09,2119.92, i went from him taking care of me to me takin care of him that was really this kaunian moment in terms of
2121.27,2122.29, you know
2122.59,2130.54, being a son and being a father but it was also the moment that i think is just important to think about failure which is how do we respond to it
2130.99,2148.72, we respond to it and do we have the people around us that will put their arm around us do we do we have the huns do we have the things that we need that take take these moments and and allow us to grow from that because these are the things that we grow from
2151.42,2165.46, you easements been a lot of different sorts of i think with
2165.49,2172.78, so many different classes of you know the types of failures we can go through and what they can be and 
2173.26,2184.81, a plan to summarize a bit on happerton's on all these different types of things that come to one as i think one take a message is fully the
2184.9,2192.49, the variety of things that can go wrong and on which levels and what that means for an
2192.64,2199.72, ah that's the so it's banishing from the except perfection i think that has been a recurring theme that
2200.17,2208.48, striving for perfection is the wrong start to begin with ranmore we learn to accept imperfection mistakes and litheness
2208.69,2213.97, the more interesting also existence becomes
2214.12,2234.07, the other thing is a scale one failure happens how do we deal with that i mean that's the main point like tomatoes and i had to think about yesterday evening as well because it beautifully
2234.22,2246.58, by just facing the fact like and that they realized themselves we have a flower a whole process and you know and and to be able to discuss that with the client and go back and say like
2246.7,2255.76, listen we looked at the thing and i think we were wrong and how often does that really happen and then in the second talk of course we have to catastrophic
2255.82,2269.56, even that just comes out of nowhere it's really nobody's fault but then how do you deal with that and how what do you take from that and so there's the whole range of ways we can be with failure and
2270.79,2274.6, i guess the most important thing is just to look them in the iron and make
2274.69,2281.71, to something in transform them so we have we have roughly five more minutes so
2281.8,2288.97, usually i mean you and has a bit difficult but we could try out we don't have an extra life but if you have a question
2289.15,2295.51, and picotee like speaking up in the big room and we will be happy to take your questions
2297.46,2303.25, i modestly
2309.58,2313.75, the reason the underlying reason for the failure are
2313.93,2316.3, ten
2319.6,2327.13, tartarin
2327.16,2358.33, so the questions the gabusson else and you see them failing like how do you help them out and did transform them into something positive i don't give him a tasmanian this one experience actually last week where we have a summer intern who just started a week ago and we gave her a very specific project and she was working very hard towards this project 
2358.33,2417.16, she decides to go on a route that not exactly what we want but we also want to give her some latitude to try out something and then eventually she gets to a point where it's definitely not what we want and so we basically had this meeting with her and explained to her you know let's think about this a different way and gave her a couple of other options and we could tell that she was a little bit okay i can i can go ahead and do this that you guys want me to do now but i guess this is a mean at least i learned these other things it doesn't really mean that it was a waste of time what i've done so far right were like oh no it wasn't at all like this is how we work you have to try a bunch of stuff and just you know and just having this very simple conversation you could see her she was like oh thank you for saying that it's okay that i that i failed at this and were like
2417.16,2434.2, that's the way it works so i feel like if if there's ever a situation where you are working with some one and there is a turn where you know maybe give him some way but then at one point really have this conversation and talk about other
2434.2,2441.7, their paths and also saying that father happens and it's part of the process and it's okay
2442.18,2466.33, manitous on focusing on modesty i mean not that that gives the ability for two people to listen to one another you as the person turned to train them and then listening to you because confidence and you see that especially people who are starting you know they want to show that their confident and that's why they sommanthe head down in the front now they just want to run through the wall and it's sometimes let them do that
2466.48,2474.1, and then when they are done and kindest it off of them and say o this is what was wrong and now let's do something together
2474.16,2475.69, all together
2475.72,2480.43, you know but to have that attitude and sort of be a model of that modesty
2482.65,2488.29, mix em success in getting a
2489.88,2491.83, it
2492.58,2496.48, rations
2499.69,2539.2, the question was about the relation of striving for failure versus sendin you work strangulation of sorcerers and stepfather
2539.2,2543.22, interesting part is and so that is
2543.25,2554.77, like putting yourself on the edge of sort of instability and putting you know the more people are involved the more systems the more things the more sororities for things to go off the rails and
2554.89,2563.59, i think that at least for me that's been a really kind of important part of my creative practices to be in that sort of unstable
2563.71,2574.54, will territory and there's a couple of things that i have learned that i think are important i sort of miss it talk about my talk which is like you
2574.57,2579.58, one concept i have is that you should be really okay to fire and retire yourself
2579.7,2607.21, i like if you fail like this idea like mentally firing yourself as a really good activity waitedst look like the fire yourself you know like the dia good job but like we had to let you go if i lieutenant then retire yourself is also like that a grave moment right to the second kind of moment of life because a lot of times these things are self there even if we have clients were self directing ourselves in terms of what we expect so and the other thing is something that
2607.72,2608.95, that i think
2609.04,2644.47, other people in that panel have alluded to and something that shone martin talks about which is a kind of intuition developing better intuition and really understanding i think a lot of times failure is about making bad decisions that decisions about time that i decisions about expectation that decisions about approach and a lot of times we don't really know what it feels like to say yes or say no entwhistle you're not you know you're not thinking about how you're to feel but you can think about what
2644.62,2649.81, to feel like everybody in the room right now can think like what am i to feel like
2649.87,2692.26, like you can get feel what that feels like and there's a sort of i think a way to understand what it feels like to say yes and when i feels like to say no and then make better decisions and i think a part of failing is understanding when you said yes when you should have said no or when you said no when you should say yes i mean not at all to that sort of the epithet i feel as like a huge learning experience is that what you say no too to find you just as much as what you say yes to so sometimes it treplin the people what i do i start with explaining to them what i don't do and i think that's really an important thing to understand there's the negative spaceship and
2692.38,2694.03, got to be that balance and
2694.21,2705.13, that's where we have to sort of master like where do we draw the line and where would not go past and why and understanding that its experience it is failure that defines that for sure but
2706.57,2714.49, a thin terms of perfection one of the things that we try to do is
2714.55,2723.58, we try to be very honest with ourselves about what were getting out of the work that were doing so for instance when we have
2723.64,2738.85, some data set that is really hard to grapple with and we have some easy way of visualizing it first on try that way and if it were as great were done but most of the time it does and i think
2738.88,2741.7, we have developed this sort of
2742.27,2750.58, a technique but we have the process where it were like okay if this visualization is in giving me what i need or it's not
2750.94,2755.38, allowing me to ask any interesting questions were not there
2755.38,2770.26, definitely not there so it's not that we're striving for perfection because we don't even know where we're going but it's more of the really be honest with yourself what are you getting out of what it is that you're doing and so we watch
2770.53,2773.62, a new technique or something and
2773.62,2784.6, very clear it's become very clear for martin and i when we feel like we have hit an interesting spot because
2784.84,2789.55, the visualization becomes something we want to play with and we just don't stop playing with it
2789.7,2795.16, so it's not necessarily perfection again but it is something that
2795.67,2809.29, just want to spend time with it and you just want to play and point and call the other person and say look at this isn't nesting and i feel like that is we tried for that we don't always get that but this is what was stridor
2811.54,2814.33, connected that to the point that you cannot
2814.66,2827.62, a something just because i vestimenti think that's the hardest thing to learn that things don't get more valuable just because the pensamiento to learn just anatole
2827.68,2835.27, because touched i guess we can take one last tiny little questioned and we have the open
2835.96,2853.72, to question her for nationally what would he say if he take away from thee a smileless many a situation was so might take away of is that coals one of the best things i ever happened to me as i don't know how long we would have spent there in
2854.17,2884.8, i do think that in the end so this the silvers us many a situation reminded me of something that i heard once a mark from face book talk about which which is i think he was offered a billion dollars or something for face book very early on and he said no and this was when friends was all the rage and everybody was like everybody pays attention to friends there and he was like it's okay
2885.28,2887.23, working on a better product
2887.71,2907.3, that's what we're going to do we're going to continue to work on it so in a sense we had to be very again on his with arises when we were working on many eyes look at what level was doing look look at what we were trying to do and the tools were developing and say okay how can we do the best work we can do but launch
2907.33,2928.75, launch fast so it made us all of a sudden focus like a laser and get the stuff done and and prioritize and the thing that is really interesting to me is that looking back we would have these never ending discussions about things that without were really important no this needs to look this way the conversation needs to flow the
2928.78,2945.7, now we look back and we're like that was so not important it's like we don't even remember the things we were thinking you were so huge and so i feel like just discounting yourself just just really being very clear about what your priorities are
2945.82,2951.85, do wonders for a complicated project and the time also gives you a lot of perspective
2954.88,2961.18, so much i mean things again for this great different perspective i think it's the blended together really well
2961.27,2982.39, my head is full and i have learned about all new kinds of alianora is that the rest are
