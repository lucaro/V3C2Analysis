5.04,9.36, evening resonate as manheim is josh and i one of the pastors
9.66,16.41, i am a little jet lagged so if you will forgive me i used to think get lagas just a myth
16.68,18.84, people who were not very tough
18.93,54.48, said when they would go on a long trip overseas or something and then i experienced it for the last ten days we were in asia and i got back and i was up at two in the morning just hanging out to in the morning and then when it was like tom to be awake i was like miserable because i was supposed to be awake but it was like time to not be away for we had just been so anyways forgive me in advance but i'm grateful to be here and a frankly i'm grateful to be back in a land of pizza and coffee there was no pizza and coffee where we were so thank you for praying for us because it was hard as a hard life out there
54.57,62.94, i've been back eating a lot of pizza and drinking a lot of coffee which has not helped with my get leg so nonetheless
62.97,148.38, we experienced incredible things overseas and we cannot wait to tell you about those things to focus our efforts internationally is going to be a powerful powerful thing so we look forward to telling you about this so seriously thank you for ringleaders like well outrageousness wonnered people
149.19,184.11, talking about easter strato right so it's bad and they like all hung out all we i think the ladies of the church had just like killing now just on high good stuff happening and then last week on video i talked to about how god is uniquely designed for the sake of the church like you have spiritual gifts have you have ability that creates unity in the church and then there's this other piece not want talk about today lootenant's one more thing in genesis chapter one the god has a design for a that is god's
184.95,186.06, time
186.93,197.67, i need to hear the sermon to night just as much as you because i struggle would god's design for time listen time as a gift
197.88,207.42, by time you can't sell time you can't steal time time is what it is and it is a gift the sixty minutes in an hour
207.66,222.24, there are twenty four hours in a day there are a hundred and sixty eight hours in a week and nothing we can do can change that ingram illustrates this you have the same amount of hours in a day as beyond a
222.75,249.87, i was desparate coffee cups says that's an ingram post where he posted i have to remind myself of this every morning and that's his copyright so we all have the same amount of god given time but here's the trouble a years and years ago there was a myth out there he said there's a day coming when technology is going to be better efficiency is going to be more the rapid change in the world is calling
249.87,251.79, more time off
252.36,270.27, now there was a time in history he thought in the future they're going to have these little devices that are going to be super efficient and make you drop your notes they're going to have these little devices and they're actually going to speed up everything for you so that you have more time with your family
271.35,277.86, this was the legend going to be a thing that led us to health
278.19,279.48, the problem is
280.23,285.66, not actually better and efficiency being king has done the opposite
285.99,299.55, torture always hustling in the forty hours a week work week is really no longer a thing because you don't have to go to your office any more you know where your offices in your back pocket
299.91,327.6, wake up in the morning and start checking email as you can wake up in the morning i start responding to text messages you can be cooking dinner and hear the anthill noise whatever noise you have on your phone and all of a sudden you are out of your home into your office even though you shouldn't be in your office you should be in your homogeneousness
328.23,343.41, his hard mastering time is hard it is hard to rebel against the narrative that culture is handing us in most of the time that i think you would say this in your friends would say this to most of the time the people you talk to when you say hey how's it going what do they respond with
343.5,347.58, most of the time they say they're busy do they not
347.91,350.76, you say your busy do you not
350.85,353.19, actually culturally good
353.34,356.01, god forbid we're not busy right
356.13,380.73, you would say an i'm so busy what else do we say in swamp like madmen swamped at work or it's been crazy this recently in the season mannerly overwhelmed and if you're not that guy i like to talk to you after service because i have some stuff to learn from you if you're actually a person that walks in no malacca the rest of us have a tendency to say i am busy but i'm doing good
380.73,388.95, super busy but doing good a lot of us dread monday there's like cat names in the world that are at actually against monday right
389.61,406.77, dread monday and there's like restaurants called think god it's friday i don't think many of those existence because they're not awesome but right grieve been there and once was enough for so these exist in youth thinking yourself often i've got a gift through the week
406.92,408.18, the weekend
408.9,420.72, work through the hardship of life so that i can get to what i'm entitled to some of you and think this and like five thirty in the evening when you're done with work you're just off
421.05,422.85, cause you earned it
423.36,424.68, american
424.77,439.08, we worked and we are and we're done now will check our phone and do some stiff but in the end you and i look at our lives and go in work i work the farm entitled to be off leave me alone i deserve this i was on now i'm all
439.68,441.6, my question is
442.35,444.3, that working for you
445.23,459.87, my question is how that system actually operating in your life is it working well my question is are you energized by this pattern of the only one in the world that every one i talked to is busy entire
461.31,473.22, i talked to busy and tired of an over stating that for the sake of argument i feel like that's the cultural dna we live in everyone's swamp everyone's busy there was doing good everyone kind of tired
474.3,480.78, i and the question is to all of us to day is that 
483.87,488.85, that question we've got to go back to genesis chapter one verse again
488.91,498.87, nadine for time as so you have a bible but you grab it and turned to page one we're going to pigeonhole one again and started bursten seven
501.96,505.95, in the chapter two were in a look at what happens
505.98,508.92, god had his way with time
510.81,514.02, it will be on the screen where there is need 
514.56,517.2, well that always has description on it
517.32,519.3, says
520.95,524.85, he this
524.88,527.37, god created man in his own image
527.49,542.49, god he created the male and female he created them and along with me and god bless them catch that blest he blessed them in important word and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it
542.58,556.11, i married people in single people be quiet right be fruitful and multiply i fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth
556.23,577.77, god said behold i've given you every plant yielding seed that's on the face of the earth and every tree and receives fruit you shall have them for food stay with me and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens into everything that creeps on earth everything that has breath of life i have given every green plant for food and it was so for thirty one
577.77,581.31, everything that he had made and behold it was very good
581.7,584.43, there was morning the sixth day
584.61,586.65, this
587.16,589.47, heavens and the earth
591.03,596.31, all of the host of him as a galaxy like i watched interstellar on the airplane so you say
596.37,606.54, crazy and only it's true the movies awesome okay and all the host of them and on the seventh day god finished his work that he had done and listened to this
610.11,615.06, all the work he done he rested so god blessed the seventh day catch the word blessed
615.45,624.15, blessed and he made it wholly because on it got rested from all of his work that he had done in creation
624.72,655.68, we see in genesis is creation a cathead's image is not the end of the story you created in his image as a beautiful powerful thing with talked about but that is not the end of the story god's image was intended to lead you to have god's character god's temperament god's rhythm god's time and god's pace in order that we might continue to grow into the flourishing of all things god gave us his image i gave as unity in the body priggishness in us but he also gave us
658.29,663.84, in health often is directly connected to whether or not we're walking in god's rhythm
664.11,673.89, walking in his image with walking tastelessly with another walking in the time he created so again the creation account for six days
674.13,676.14, hard at work
676.44,707.43, he starts working from a place of eternal rest is perfectly restful walking and community in the trinity just walking in a fullness of rest and then he creates out of that rest and an intent of the day on the seventh day he rested for six days is hard work heaven earth sun moon stars fish plants creepings that crawl big animals are stand galaxies all of this is done in six days and you think you had a productive weak
708.12,710.67, what god did in six days
710.94,717.9, so for six days he accomplishes everything that's ever been created he creates and then he
722.49,724.8, let that sink in for a second
728.04,729.63, listen
730.29,731.85, never tired
733.05,747.63, weary god never needed to sleep god never needs a nap because that sleeping right god never ever been weary than frustrated had a bad day no worries never ever ever struggled with anything yet
749.88,753.24, this word and in the hebrew is sub
753.33,755.88, the we get sabbath
758.37,768.36, in this picture in the story and how the old testament unpaginated how the jewish people understood it to be sabbath men something imitated and you worship
768.57,777.21, what happened in the picture of rest and worships to other things the sabbath literally contained celebration and satisfaction
777.66,794.1, so had done it was very good and in some way he rested in that and he celebrated that he was satisfied but what he had accomplished and in so doing in the creation account in so doing he weaved into the fabric of existence
796.8,807.09, no two things in this county not take you an you can notice these two things in a ration on the first thing to notice is the god bless
808.86,825.15, blessed three things in the creation of count what are they number one animals number two people would have animals and people blessed to do their best to be fruitful and multiply their their blessed to create life and in the same way he blesses the savissan other words the sabbath
825.27,828.09, a god given ability to bring life
828.72,840.87, it inherently in it has added core debility to bring life because work the pleats energy the rest refills you with creativity and maturity rest
843.39,846.24, giving back to you your life
846.81,849.18, bless the avenue two
849.3,853.02, no made the sabbath holy
853.68,879.69, now if you if you study the bible or know this there's some techniques out there to study the bible one of the biblical interpretation techniques that oftentimes people use is they find a word in scripture and the figure out where the first time that word was used in scripture and from the first usage you can see a kind of glance some understanding of how the rest of the time the bible uses that word the very first time the bible
880.53,883.2, god made the sabbath holy
883.41,900.39, holymead apart holinesse crated for holy means that that your different so in other words god says the saved is a wholly time it's a wholly set apart thing and god looked at this and he says the savages a place of otherness
900.78,918.12, place of transcendence is set apart its consecrated different the hubers would say the very air on the day of the sabbath it literally breathed into you differently now that sounds weird but they would say this phrase that the air on the day of the sabbath is air that his whole
918.99,922.14, the breathing was different on the sad
922.62,927.0, that's how the experience because it was another nest to the day
928.26,958.65, joshua hastily he was a jewish rabbi that wrote this book called the sabbath and he's been very helpful to marry the few years ago but it was really beautiful when he talks about what the sabbath was in there understanding because he talks about how as americans we so often are passionate about space nor may space like a conquering space like today at work to do a gottingen i've got you know suberintendent on time
959.4,975.09, says you master space and for one day you master time and he talks about time and is really beautiful word pictures and one place he says the sabbath as we understood it were great cathedral they were an architecture in time
975.39,989.76, this was a day you walked into and it served above you as as a different kind of experience all together it was a blessed was full of life it was wholly the day of his sabbath is the day that god has my full attention
990.81,993.96, he writes in this way he says
996.18,1009.5, the most precious present mankind has received from the treasure house of god what a senate right the sabbath is the most precious present mankind has received from the treasure house of god all week long we think
1009.5,1011.54, spirit is too far away from me
1011.99,1027.62, and up we scamper absenteeism and in our best days we pray god would you send us a little bit of your spirit but not so on the sabbath on the sabbath the spirit stands before us and pleads with us except all excellence for me
1028.22,1036.65, there was even a difference in the way we prayed on the sabbath there's a story he tells where they would go pray for sick people and sick people complain they would say no no not on the sabbath
1039.29,1051.14, completely different understanding of what this means for us to understand there's an invitation god gives to us where he will meet us in time and speak to us in a powerful way
1052.34,1056.54, a moment here and there 
1056.99,1060.74, but you see in the stories he says benson he said
1063.8,1073.82, you see this further when at the ten commandments we laid out and and remember the sabbath and keep it holy as one of the ten commandments belisante savage is not the same as a day off
1074.15,1086.21, you don't work for your employer don't get paid but it's the day you probably go to the bank you probably go to the store you probably run some marriage you probably do something that is great that is an incredible american tradition staff
1087.56,1110.21, the post offices and always open right so you got to go to the post of okay so that's an incredible thing but the savage isn't necessarily just a day off for you run errants an understanding that this particular time is a time of rest and a time of worship and homesteads apart
1110.57,1115.1, oh that was fun history time but when the world is that mean for us
1115.76,1128.48, we live on the other side of jesus on the other side of the resurrection and if you know your new testament you know there is no command of sabbath in the new testament if you know your new testament you know the sabbath is the day that jesus got in a tone of trouble
1129.53,1134.0, it was the sabbath losses had the fairies always cut in em out for stuff
1134.54,1141.89, and aveline picking berries on the sabbath like you can't do that and he's like really i'm eating berries with my boys
1142.37,1144.71, to
1145.07,1162.23, the parson has let me remind you i am the lord of the sabbath and the sabbath was made for man oredan with a mad for the savages was made for the man in other words sabatini the lord i am the lord i gave you a gift in the sanitary making all these rules
1162.8,1165.71, they did it wrong
1165.86,1174.71, sally thought that at the point of the sabbath was to be honored by man and god comes and jesus comes along as no no the saddest was supposed to give a gift
1178.28,1181.07, no command in the new testament
1183.53,1184.79, have to
1186.38,1187.22, don't
1187.28,1188.33, to
1189.08,1192.56, no command in the new testament that you should get eight hours of sleep
1192.98,1198.56, no command in new testament you shall three meals a day there's also nothing in the new testament about coffee
1200.09,1201.68, these are gifts
1202.13,1205.34, these are good get
1206.39,1208.67, not getting your rest
1208.79,1217.94, healthy winnings juice of the lord called coffee
1217.97,1219.56, are you not
1221.99,1236.63, incredible beautiful gifts can they be taken advantage of of course can they be extorted of course everything that god gives us a gift people take too far and use and abuse the wrong way but these are gifts and listen this gift of sabbath this gift of rest
1237.17,1241.67, warner's going to call it rest this gift of rest
1242.54,1248.09, incredibly difficult in this gift has been lost because resting
1248.3,1250.61, lunarian
1251.51,1252.95, with this
1253.49,1254.72, how to work
1254.81,1257.06, we know how to play
1257.15,1260.75, pretty good at that i video games count right were pretty good at that
1260.9,1262.16, know how to rest
1262.76,1273.59, i know how to worship a lot of us go a day where i don't do anything johansens boring one of my supposed to do like titmouse and this is called the sabbath let me just be quiet and awkward
1273.59,1275.06, this
1275.3,1277.16, to church
1277.88,1283.73, i don't stint what i'm talking about
1284.96,1293.87, talking about our identity being wrapped up in what we do and god coming along going on enough your identity should be wrapped up in what i've done for you
1294.11,1297.71, this is very clearly seen and how well you re
1298.25,1306.38, often we go i've got to do something to have work and got goes no you have worth because i've done something for you in christ
1306.98,1308.51, some
1308.93,1310.04, remember that
1310.37,1317.27, some time to remember that i can do more for you when you're doing nothing that you can do for you when you're doing everything
1318.2,1327.98, accomplish things for you is already accomplished things for you and this gift of rest is offered to share do it daily yeah but be good at it no
1328.43,1334.55, helpful to pick a day and really one in on that absolutely is that is absolutely
1334.67,1340.79, it was say it's important to get here and have no desire to look at the bible and see it from that perspective
1344.81,1359.27, in the book of mark the majority of jesus's healing to place on the sabbath the sabbath was the day that jesus did his best work the sabbath was a day of healing and i submit to you is still a day of feeling
1359.84,1361.31, still a day
1361.49,1366.44, rest still a time when jesus can do some of his best work in 
1366.68,1378.2, i know some in the room were like afraid of the silence you don't want to turn off your cell phone you don't want to turn off netley don't want to turn off your computer you don't even know if your computer turns off right you've never done that
1378.38,1381.32, one time you lost your cord and you were paralyzed
1381.62,1384.56, a temper sent battery you get anxious
1385.88,1389.57, they so i know
1393.14,1395.66, to be accessible
1396.14,1398.09, need to be needed
1398.33,1400.79, incredibly addicting drug
1401.09,1402.74, don't want you to walk
1403.13,1413.45, constantly have to be needed you constantly have to be accessible you constantly have to be available god does not want that for you and frankly jesus never struggled with that
1414.32,1439.04, this picture of rabouillet ration i want you to use maybe as a way of looking at this so this is a semi circle and i want it of the same circle you have the word rest and on the other side you have the word or if you're abomination
1439.13,1446.9, engineers like that i don't know maybe you like metronomes whatever it is a way by which you see the rhythm of god playing out
1447.29,1449.63, i find you 
1449.93,1455.78, on the other way round
1456.26,1465.38, accounting to say to us and if you even think about it this way it is that when man was created the very first thing god made him do as rest
1466.19,1470.06, adam could work from rest
1470.51,1473.42, no work for rest
1473.81,1481.73, incredibly burnt out because we work for board for work in the finally i can rest instead of going to work rested
1482.45,1503.69, walking into our places a word walking in our places of cultivating the world and so doing it like god as is to be walking into those places fully rested fully trusting in your identity and christ fully knowing that you who you are as because of what he's done now because of what you do then what they say about your work doesn't hurt so much and you're not so sensitive all the time because you just came out of a place of rest
1504.83,1513.35, to take on the day and you're able to be creative and you're able to have your head clear because you turn off your computer and you put away your phone and you just met with the lord
1513.44,1523.79, the thebans critical case i don't celebrate
1524.57,1537.38, the out of rest into work and if you think this is a new testament picture and two more words than the word of inheritress
1538.1,1550.37, so the second thing is rest and work and leads to abiding and bearing fruit so in john chapter fifteen entered the first five verses but where you see the same exact picture
1551.06,1552.47, different
1552.71,1555.89, his teaching his disciples what it means to be
1556.22,1560.72, near to god and from that nearness going out and bearing fruit for god
1561.68,1565.91, familiar with this probably would talk about this before resonate
1566.63,1568.97, says i am the true vine
1569.21,1571.19, my father is divine just
1572.09,1579.8, a mind that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch does bear for he prunes that it may bear more fruit
1580.1,1587.9, you are clean you hear that your pen like not you did some stuff and got clean but already you are clean because of the word if spoken to you
1587.93,1600.8, and me rest and me being union with me and i in you at the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abide in the vine neither can you unless you bid and me
1601.07,1603.08, your
1603.47,1612.14, in him he is the bears much fruit for apart from me ye can do nothing
1612.8,1625.73, to say it is without resting in the lord you better not be working for the lord the new testament way to say it i don't dare try to bear fruit unless your daring to abide there
1626.21,1629.33, out of abiding the fruit comes
1629.48,1636.14, it is out of a super natural connection with god that you walk into a natural world and no supernatural things
1636.2,1648.71, in other words if you go i'm going to bear some fruit and do some stuff for the lord and now out of that burning fruit okay now lord i made a little bit of help okay thank you i'm going to go barefoot it's a union with the lord first
1649.28,1652.34, for the lord
1653.57,1678.02, understanding the from rest we work from union an abiding with christ within go and bear fruit goes even further in this picture of being which leads to doing and then lastly the picture of covenant which leads to kingdoms of leverage a second you see that on the left side of the diagram god is inviting us at the beginning
1678.35,1680.51, i designed for time
1680.99,1696.08, in him to be rested in him to recognize that you are who you are because of what he is accomplished for you your human being not a human doing you probably heard that before and then lastly it is his covenant with you
1696.53,1705.83, with us relationship with you that leads to his responsibility to the ask of you to be a person of the kingdom
1706.52,1720.86, it unbalanced were not walking in the rhythm god has designed for a safe look over here we go men all the time a more king try to bear for a most do and stuff and moving forward the kingdom and you look back to life and your burnt out
1720.95,1722.33, frustrated
1722.51,1729.92, alfred a frustrated with you because of the way you're acting you on the other side and go manewhile since i rested
1730.43,1738.56, i abided is a while since i reminded myself the god is the reason i have my identity
1741.95,1748.16, this matters to us is because this is the process by which god prunes us and god grows us
1749.39,1753.29, how is it the god is going to grow as was going to grow 
1753.32,1755.87, bishareens
