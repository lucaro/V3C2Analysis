9.84,27.96, a little bit of a feeling for the journey of discovery of astronomy so where astronomy started where it's evolved to some of the amazing things is found along the way of the journey but then looking at the next step the big steps of discovery that are come with new direction telescopes like the scar
32.52,40.29, this car is gone the world's largest estimate of faculty is going to be a new generation of radio to escape
40.29,45.18, times bigger than anything ever built before for science
45.24,57.18, amazing step into the unknown into the discovery of the universe i'll push us back to that time in the universe when the very very first objects were being formed so it's extremely exciting time to besides
61.17,91.5, many dishes because it there is to build them and one large one because it chaperon easier to build small ones and one big one but also if you've got a lot o little ones you actually spread them out across not just a calamity by a plummet of but actually three thousand comedies in the more you spread out radio dishes the higher the fidelity of the higher the resolution of the imitators will seminole ting are of equivalent of one square columba who also got this enormous extent three thousand calamities that gundred high resolution in your pictures as well
96.66,98.07, i
98.13,106.44, something which is going to capture the imagination of everybody not just astronomers but young people because of astronomy and the things at all discover
106.47,143.67, because of the incredible challenges it's going to produce in terms of building the c computer scientists because it's going to be the world's biggest computer science project or optics deploring people command control people of engineering and technical skills are going to be called upon to buildings project in the world the worcester the world's largest dares these are all going to be part of the escort not just not just since it outreaching and with great technology with demanding technology comes innovation and comes discovery
143.85,158.1, last time when these big projects was going on like the lodge had run colliding that project is a byproduct invented the weight of the webers are amazing that paralysed and so we can imagine the sort of things of a company as carojac
162.27,186.54, i think the way the stars being designed to answer a number of really interesting questions about the universe but the most exciting thing to me is the things that we don't know the things that we all see happen as pirates there the serendipity if you like that the discoveries that are made which the capacity in the potential the ascaris enormous as a sainted times more capacity to discover than any telescope of haifa
190.59,205.8, i think it's important that we build the escaut in the place where it can do the job is designed to do it has to be in the place where it can do the science it can produce the results that it is designed to do
205.92,237.81, my mind that is australia australia we have the world's most ready required side we have a country which is exactly the right size to fit the escalade the kinds of science that it means to do but we have the conditions that conditions are right and australia wants to make a home here in australia for the world this is a world telescope it's not about australia and tafia to about the world there are twenty countries who want to build this creole like to give to the world outside provide a home for the scaean be the home base for radio strongly for the faceplate
