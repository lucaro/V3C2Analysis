2.67,13.17, welcome to balance body pottinger jane from fusilades of athelnoth carolina and to day we're going to be looking at exercises for pregnancy
13.2,66.45, this is my friend claudian she's in her second trimeter and she's going to be demonstrating these exercises so first we're going to do the hovering nice series really focusing on the transverse dominated set belt muscle and in pregnancy and labor this is the abdominal that we really want to concentrate on wetterstein in couture this is really going to help your boy bounce back after delivery
66.54,72.6, all right let's get started claudius going to go on to all fours hands and knees
73.5,82.38, risk right under the shoulders knees under the hips now we want to really work on finding her neutral spin in neutral pelvis in this position
82.44,93.12, and here once she finds the neutral fine a neutral pallas she's focusing on hugging her kittens up into her spine so take a deep in hail
93.39,109.47, and on exhaust pool kittens up into the spine so she's tightening that safety good go ahead and curl your toes under take another deep and hal now on her next exili wanted to tighten the sea belt and then flow the knees up
109.68,142.95, here in a long gate and then on the next excited her to tighten that he felt even more to float the knees down to the floor let's try that one more time curl the toender inhale broadening through the collar bone and upper back exalting the seat belt smoothly picking the knees up in hell mornington the spine through the breath execute baby deeper and deeper into the front of the spine to slowly decelerate beneath down a back into child's post rest
144.3,151.53, and just direct the breath into the back side ribs into the lower back and exhales
152.07,152.88, it
153.0,206.28, with that breath what we're looking for is on the first part of the exhale to really find that that muscle action to hug the skeleton protect it second to last part of clemente movement of the knees come up right really smooth and blue it and then the coming down your ease and trick or letting go action really really important to keep that same breath quality and to deepen that got us muscle even more as the knees come down to the floor i sometimes like to think and i sometimes to my clients at their knees are made of glass so they have to gently set the knees down so really fighting against gravity so now i look at another sequence where she does that same first part then we take a second breath and go into a down dog position curl the toender
207.3,216.57, really broadening here take a deep inhale on extensive muscle and flow the knees a little bit up off the floor
216.9,233.34, hold here in hale on exile tightest muscle and then aloud he had to go up and back pressing down into the heels now soften your knees just a little bit really present to the thumb first finger and broad and through your upper back and collar bone
233.46,247.62, now in her in holland went her to shift forward finding the floating near position excluded into the spine and slowly slowly lower than ease down very good said back into child's house of great
247.74,250.89, and again to stress the breath into your back body
251.49,253.38, deep inhales an exile
254.97,256.68, and here
256.89,266.13, now quitting her second trimeter this next version i rarely do this next version with my third crimesters so with the first and second
266.13,278.34, good and sometimes people will bring their knees down on this point position that were about to come into so you can always that have that is an option for your first second trimeter so come back up on to all fours
278.91,282.27, again she's going to do that same floating me
282.54,310.2, take a deep and hale good exosphere and then on your next exile's going to link in the legs one at a time the legs can be together or a little bit apart now she really wants to hug the kittens up in her spoon little bit of bottom glided and then bend one man flowed it you can walk your foot back in and the other foot back and float the knees and then on your child in the seat belt muscle to slowly lower the need
310.38,312.51, rest back into child has
312.54,315.48, so we all tried that one more time
316.26,322.74, great and we vituperate your hands just a little bit more so you get a little bit more link than your chest come on up again
322.95,366.09, a little bit more separation a lot of times you know regular clients pregnant clients have a tendency to bring their arms to close in these poses that you want to make sure they're not doing that so they get enough opening in the front back of their body curl your toes under take a deep inhaling and shoulders away from the ears on the axle hushaby and slowly float the sago you can walk one leg out and then the other like out take a deep cloven front of the hips and really hug the baby into the spine good on your next exile walk one foot and beneath other foot and benny open up your upper back slowly float down and sit back into child's head round your back
369.48,403.98, so you have three different combinations that you can focus in on really feeling the deep abdominal now you can do this whole thing without even lifting the knees of the map you can just cure your client to keep hugging the kittens into the front of the spine or deepening the seat belt muscle and try to just find a lightness of the new hats up off the floor so you don't actually have to have them lift up but you want them to really have that feeling of that support beneath the belly button that kind of flat and on the front of the pelvis
404.28,410.58, thanks for joining us and hope to see next time good word lady
