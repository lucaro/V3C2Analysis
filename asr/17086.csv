309.75,313.11, the message from
313.29,314.67, the angel
314.85,317.25, was anything but sad
318.21,324.54, instead this amazing news from the angel gabrel to marry was a call to her
324.72,326.1, pride
326.73,329.19, every jewish girl prayed
329.43,335.61, dreamed the privilege to one day carry and provide the long awaited messiah
335.64,337.02, god's people
338.1,339.27, thought
339.39,342.39, being chosen to be part of god's plan

347.25,349.2, the call of christmas
350.16,352.38, just like god

366.99,368.85, we 
369.36,372.42, the stage for us and the six months
373.35,376.98, angel gabriel was sent from god to a city of galilee
377.04,378.57, nazareth
378.93,380.55, nazareth is
380.58,382.95, very different from the city
383.19,386.94, you see it makes sense that the messiah
387.18,390.36, should come from jerusalem
390.51,392.7, as the center
392.94,396.66, the jewish world as well as all of the beaten path
396.9,402.51, he was seen as the significance athenaean as very insignificant
403.71,406.83, what the people of that day thought of nazareth
407.49,409.92, ever
410.1,412.77, can anything good
412.92,414.45, come out of nazareth
415.65,417.57, the region of galilee
418.14,424.26, was was very different from the region of judea gaily was out in the boones
425.01,427.59, judea had a big city
427.92,430.2, was not kosher
431.16,432.81, i was on
433.47,435.63, keep in all the religious rules
436.56,438.84, god chooses
439.44,441.99, most unlikely choice
443.55,446.04, i guess what
446.31,448.8, call to provide
449.25,451.26, happen anywhere
453.39,455.64, matter if you live in the big city
456.15,457.86, live out in the country
458.61,462.42, matter if you're on the right side of the track to the wrong side of the tracks
462.87,465.09, no matter if you live at the beach
465.24,467.13, you're from the west side
468.06,470.04, those where you are
470.67,474.06, he has a message for you
474.33,476.58, he is calling you
477.3,478.41, christmas
479.76,481.56, you are this christmas
482.28,485.25, and use you as a part of his plan
485.61,487.17, this will
487.35,489.15, know where you are
489.18,493.59, he has plans for every one of us no matter where
493.65,494.73, come from
495.39,497.76, he goes on to tell us
497.97,504.93, the one who would be called on to provide the saviour the world would be the most unlikely person
505.14,511.56, and the gods of the world so god sent gabriel first twenty seven to aversion
511.62,519.87, to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary
520.44,523.17, at that mary was betrothed
523.38,529.35, jonas a bigger deal than our engagements today jewish engagement
529.77,533.25, considered as sacred as the marriage itself
533.91,536.52, marriage would be consummated later
537.0,538.35, the commitment
538.65,540.06, the covenant
540.51,542.31, just a strong
542.7,548.91, fact that the mother of jesus would be a virgin was prophesied by a sail
548.94,552.12, many years before as a chapter 
552.21,553.77, before
554.19,558.33, therefore the lord himself will give you a sign
558.78,559.89, whole
560.34,562.65, virgin self conceived
562.86,564.21, embarrassing

584.58,585.9, it 
586.59,588.9, came to her and said greetings
588.96,591.69, favored one the lord is with you
592.35,594.3, more things change
594.9,606.12, more things stay the same while this greeting from the angel sounds unique at first it's the same way the angel of the lord greeted another unsuspecting
606.18,608.13, with a call
608.43,609.69, provide
609.75,617.55, the book of judges god called a man named gideon to set his people free from oppression
617.73,620.46, chapter six a burst
621.3,624.69, and the angel of the lord appeared to him and said to him
624.99,630.3, lord is with you o mighty man of valor
630.6,638.52, message from the angel to gideon and to marry includes the reminder that the lord is with you
639.27,640.44, name
640.56,643.35, a prophecy for the messiah
643.77,645.3, a manual
645.33,648.51, manual means god with us
648.75,651.42, another way of saying that the lord
651.6,654.09, with you to day
654.96,656.7, all of christmas
657.03,660.69, reminder that the lord is with us
661.02,662.73, call to marry
662.97,665.25, a call to provide
665.4,670.08, only some one very special in the eyes of god
670.2,673.68, be called to provide the birth of the christ child
674.85,677.55, the fact that she was a virgin
678.06,682.32, that god would be involved to create the life inside of her
683.34,685.89, one who was called to provide
686.25,687.93, the salvation
688.08,689.61, all the world
689.79,692.46, call to provide a scary
692.88,694.77, and we get understand
694.98,696.93, mary would be fearful
698.94,701.64, she was greatly troubled at the same
702.45,704.16, tried to discern
704.31,706.77, sort of greeting this might be
707.49,712.08, angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you i found favor with god
712.44,713.64, the whole
713.73,716.46, you will conceive in your room
716.61,718.11, baron
718.8,721.17, and you shall call his name jesus
721.68,723.15, the great
723.27,725.61, will be called the son of the most high
725.79,730.74, and the lord god will give to him the throne of his father david
730.77,735.87, he will reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom
737.61,738.99, in
739.53,742.74, the names we give our children describe
742.83,744.09, hope
744.24,745.59, children
745.92,748.56, and this name would certainly bring hope
748.65,752.94, all the people because the name jesus means the lord is
753.27,754.59, on
755.28,758.79, was being called to provide the birth
758.94,760.65, the savior
760.77,762.3, the whole world
762.9,765.21, mary was not the source
765.54,768.78, salvation as some people believe
769.23,772.86, a god who chose to put his favour
772.92,779.34, to her it was god who created the source of salvation in her
779.55,782.97, theological truth is mary by herself
783.45,786.21, not produce a son
787.29,788.64, but god
788.94,790.86, produce a son
791.13,794.43, her and his name is cheeses
795.06,799.77, this is the complete expression of the gospel
800.07,805.86, we are not able to provide a sacrifice ourselves
805.89,808.26, god has chosen
808.44,810.15, i hope
811.62,819.96, the good news that the gospel the call of christmas was to an unknown virgin
819.96,821.7, a little country village
821.91,823.47, mary's call
823.59,829.26, to provide what god had decided she simply made herself available
829.59,831.69, god took care of the rest
833.16,834.57, mary is
835.11,839.25, processing from the angel what was said she asks
839.34,841.35, a logical question
841.65,844.05, since she had not had six
844.17,846.03, could she become pregnant
849.09,853.29, mary said to the angel how will this be since i'm a virgin
853.92,857.04, he didn't say that she didn't believe
857.49,862.38, he was asking trying to understand what god was doing you know god
862.47,864.33, never gets tired
864.51,869.04, asking honest questions of him
869.04,878.37, with god for us to see him and try to understand who he is and what he is trying to do in our lives
879.15,880.98, like we have to do
881.67,883.77, mary was learning
883.86,886.17, trust god with the details
886.44,890.97, mary was being called to be part of the promise
891.18,893.79, her part was to provide the birth
893.85,898.41, the savior of the world so merry excepted her call
898.44,901.74, and she put her trust in god
901.83,903.84, do what he promised to do
904.8,910.65, mary was given the opportunity to join with god in the call of christmas
911.01,912.51, provided
912.6,914.82, details though gabriel
915.33,917.04, first 
918.3,919.98, the age or answered her
920.82,923.55, holy spirit will come upon you
925.02,927.15, power of the most high
927.3,929.43, overshadow you
929.91,933.15, therefore the child to be born will be called
935.04,936.39, son of god
937.23,943.8, luke right about this conversation he mentions the holy spirit seven times
944.16,946.08, just two chapters
946.44,952.32, does not want his readers to forget that the call of christmas is all about
952.38,955.11, work of the holy spirit
955.8,962.01, only with the holy spirit come upon mary to explain to her the details of what's going on
962.25,963.81, also tells us
964.08,970.08, god's power is going to overshadow mary in the process
970.71,973.05, word for overshadow
973.29,975.63, the original language means
975.66,978.06, holy powerful
978.24,979.53, presence
979.71,981.3, god himself
981.75,984.12, same meaning from this word
984.33,988.29, used in the old testament when the cloud that overshadowed
988.32,989.49, temple
989.55,991.92, filled with the glory of god
992.04,996.12, this an accident chapter forty or thirty four
997.29,999.81, the cloud covered the tent of meeting
1000.2,1003.05, and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle
1003.35,1013.07, and moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory of the lord filled
1015.44,1018.02, presence of god described
1018.05,1023.93, in the old testament is the same word overshadow that gabriel used to explain to mary
1024.41,1026.0, presence
1026.48,1028.88, his holy spirit
1029.69,1034.04, going to be at work in such a way that there is no doubt
1034.37,1036.8, what is going on in this story
1037.13,1040.01, happening right in front of us
1040.49,1042.32, something that's wholly
1042.95,1044.0, we
1045.05,1055.25, the singing christmas tree the presence of god in our parking lot not in the church out in the parking lot was so real
1055.85,1057.5, so powerful
1058.04,1059.87, it cannot be denied
1060.5,1064.97, that's because god inhabits the prayers
1065.06,1067.34, and the praise of his people
1068.0,1070.19, god is with us
1070.73,1073.22, he is real
1073.67,1075.5, he is amazing
1076.55,1078.41, as our car sang
1079.07,1084.02, our band played in the park a lot i was overshadowed by the presence
1084.92,1086.42, the holy spirit
1087.5,1089.3, i would watch
1089.54,1095.75, singer saying in the band play and i would see people that i knew their story
1096.47,1099.74, how god had brought life change
1100.1,1101.84, amazing way
1102.68,1106.52, what overshadowed by the holy spirit does
1107.24,1109.58, a word is used again
1109.76,1115.55, in the story of the transfiguration of jesus the matthew chapter seventeen
1116.63,1121.85, he was still speaking when behold a bright cloud overshadowed them
1122.33,1125.75, a voice from the clouds said this is my beloved son
1126.14,1128.12, whom i am well pleased
1132.14,1139.43, scholars believe that this over shadowing of god is not a static thing but an active
1139.82,1141.74, it is creative
1142.34,1144.29, productive
1144.59,1147.05, holy spirit calls
1147.08,1149.06, virgin to conceive
1149.54,1152.0, it's the same spirit of god
1152.27,1155.51, that was at work in the creation of the world
1155.63,1157.64, as recorded in genesis
1158.66,1161.15, earth was without form and void
1161.75,1164.33, darkness was over the face of the deep
1165.44,1168.02, the spirit of god was hovering
1168.14,1169.76, over the face
1169.85,1171.17, the waters
1172.13,1174.2, the spirit of god

1200.06,1204.47, all of christmas for mary was a call to provide
1204.71,1211.85, holy spirit comes upon mary and it enables her as a spirit always does
1212.06,1217.04, more than you could ever thank you could do to be more
1217.04,1220.55, you could ever think you could be by yourself
1221.27,1223.61, power on the outside
1223.82,1232.94, holy spirit on the inside together results in things being done that are absolutely impossible
1233.36,1234.74, o god
1235.61,1236.96, at the same time
1237.41,1240.8, god is supernaturally providing the details
1241.13,1252.56, how the missile will be born to the kindness of god is seen by how he provides some one to walk along beside mary
1254.99,1257.75, and behold your relative elizabeth
