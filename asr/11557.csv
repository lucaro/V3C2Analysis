0.36,1.53, he
9.24,11.97, who's got the guts
13.29,15.33, perhaps
15.51,16.71, the gods
16.98,18.18, he
18.78,21.33, even though it could have been raining it is not
21.36,25.86, do you have the gods because we need your god now
25.86,27.21, experiment
28.68,31.59, without you and your courage
31.71,34.26, stomachs we cannot do that experiment
34.65,36.96, it's in two parts
37.11,43.38, talk both of them about god's first in the sense of the experiment that i want to do
44.97,47.19, very very simple experiment
48.06,50.49, takes a lot of courage on your side
50.91,56.67, experiments involving phenomenon known from every day life in particular when you
56.97,60.54, it is the phenomenon of tickling
60.96,68.19, tried with the help of depending in as many languages as i could come up with
68.19,72.93, what king is you take it mother person with your fingers on the skin
73.23,80.13, i want to do this experiment in two parts the first part is extremely boring but we'll get quickly over it
80.31,86.49, first part is that everyone in this room will be kicking themselves
87.96,90.06, some kind of
90.12,100.98, skin that you can reach you will take to yourself and you will notice as this is really really boring because nothing really happens you can take yourself but it doesn't tickle
101.82,108.36, we have to come up with something else to do this so i'll ask every one in this audience to turn to the person
108.36,111.06, standing to your right side
111.3,121.77, take that person
128.61,135.78, much
138.93,144.9, it seems that involving all the persons in your life does make a difference
147.81,153.27, tis a problem however here that all of the people sitting at one end of the role
153.3,167.94, we're not take old and low at the other end of the road didn't have the opportunity to take so please will you now turn to a person sitting on your left and take back
174.36,176.04, very much
180.27,184.83, cried the man audiences if you would like to see another audience suffer
185.67,188.58, in my home page toward the 
188.7,201.57, we you can see an audience in berlin covered by seven cameras you will you are fortunate enough not to be covered that way here doing the thing and it's a great great fun to watch just like you were
201.93,203.55, and if you noticed
204.99,214.44, staring at me in an i was the one person in this tent that was untouched and didn't didn't do harm to any one else
214.47,217.56, at the power of words
217.68,220.53, so you cannot really take yourself
221.16,232.83, at least not in a way that tickles sciences have been growing with this problem he is a machine built about ten years ago to permit people to take themselves
232.83,257.91, because you have this machine that will displace the whereabouts of this little thing that will take you so it comes as a surprise and even the experiment will introduce a chiming fact of the contests of surprise and the finest thing here is that you can in yucatan tickling when you take yourself in this robotic way this was done a nescience project
258.03,274.92, a blamable the machine at the craneman of this study was chris if leading international series on schizophrenia you know it annalise and they can take a themselves in a way that tickles now
275.25,277.77, like to go to my instances
278.58,297.27, why what does this phenomenon till itself as something that we already have learned from studying monkey monkeys bringing oesteron year of the publication is from it's a year old studying orange juice
297.27,315.54, on the top here among gets the orestes at this point and immediately these strong reaction in the brain of the monkey a lot of dooming is produced and to bamania heard of signals and the monetary happy because he gets oranges
315.87,329.46, people do that when they go into a restaurant and get food they get happy too but then you train them on kenesaw that a signal will tell it or in us is coming and you will be served soon
329.61,336.27, so what happens then is that the monkey when he gets a signal orestes on his way
336.33,347.52, the conclave of dominora ariston its way because now no it's coming to its very happy just like in a restaurant but when it actually arrives
348.03,350.37, the wrong button i was
350.55,362.73, go back one here we should yearn what happens here is that all the doberman comes when the orange went when the hostess announced but when it actually served
362.88,376.14, happen because if you're quite serintha you will get at you and scientific experiments are more reliable than the people in restaurants so the margins that they will get it jeanne
377.04,391.17, no connected to that so if you're quite certain of things they will no longer be a joy to you scientists call it the room reward prediction are it's really when you get something you didn't expect
391.77,397.17, more than you expected that you feel joy when you get exactly what you expect
397.41,401.1, western person taking his morning shower
401.25,426.51, jangaru about that even though millions and billions of people on this planet would be you just get sour and angry when it doesn't work because she got used to it and so i prayed this formalities he menaced in an aversion the serpentine gallery in london i'm very proud of it what i say is that toronto serves entereth the more control you have a staff
426.51,430.02, joyful it seems to you your morning shower
430.41,432.99, notice until it doesn't work
433.38,438.54, if you're surprised there's a chance that you become very joyful
439.08,446.46, so if you want to you should not have too much control but the problem of course is that our civilization is all about
446.52,470.97, to control and predict everything and made them predictable that it doesn't rain when we are discussing mad at least inside the tent that we have streets where we have a predictable surface we can be on or walk on that train on time civilisation
471.21,483.72, that's great because we get rid of all these problems that are not but it doesn't make us happy because we just get used to it so our world in the sense when we create a world that we control that we cultivate the 
483.93,486.39, to be pleasing to us
486.81,497.4, it is that it stops being joyful because it is exactly as we expected civilization will calway our unhappiness but it will not make us happy
497.76,503.37, that's very simple lesson but it seems to be very surprising for civilized people like ourselves
504.27,507.18, civilization is very much like kicking yourself
507.27,516.27, because there's no surprise out there when you're tickling yourself your brain knows exactly what will happen so it will not be taken he that tickling sensation
516.45,519.39, it is just like that and it doesn't take
520.17,522.42, become dull and boring
523.65,532.8, what is it how does that relate to food now let's go to god number two let's go to the actual got
532.95,536.1, stomach or intestines and all that
537.39,542.43, inside of you say tickling is about your skin your outside surface
542.43,544.53, at your inside surface
545.52,570.21, sides pretty big he is drawing from one of my books published more than twenty years ago where you have the human being seen as a joke basically that the cheering from the mouse to the other end which is a little like the outside skin cubistic drawing and you can see the human being as his extended donkin of character
571.02,611.04, hoping is that well he's a comer of the maine since from thousand five in a special issue on the intrusive the god which has a lot of beautiful articles about this system with the general idea this is a huge system the trouser is teniente mouth and our and your hand because it is leatherface you have there you can actually comprehension
611.31,621.0, a little green thing there is the togaed of skin that you have that the outside surface that suffers the tickling sensation
621.06,629.25, you take your lungs they're very cleverly arranged so there's a lot of surface inside your long they are sort of footnote and folded
629.34,638.31, and the long a a pretty big as about a hundred square meters that you have right there in your chest but then the intestines
638.79,652.8, a very conservative estimate of what is the surface area of this enormously long nine ten year long to with all the folding inside and all the wrappings and all the funniest things going on
652.83,655.86, the conservative estimate is square made
656.49,660.72, morning you heard a less conservative estimate which was times higher
660.87,671.04, important thing is that it's much much much much higher than the actual skin surface much much higher so there's more surface within you than without you
672.72,674.76, here is enormous
674.91,676.53, particularly
677.46,682.68, taking it all as something about the outside service but but here you are you really have something to take 
683.13,706.62, you would say i but but this in a service isn't really a surface it's just a hole inside man nothing much goes on there you put comfort in and you get gomshott's it it's not really a border to the other like the like the skins but i lashed inside your
707.25,711.45, live on the order of one million million
711.63,713.91, foreign microorganisms
714.03,715.59, of which
715.71,725.76, free living organisms with their own reproductive system they are an ability to reproduce themselves their own gnadigen from ours they in every respect living beings
726.21,727.77, one
727.92,730.83, millions of those inside your stomach
732.6,735.6, one of times more
736.26,741.93, the number of cells that you have in your body which is what you can compare to these my programs
742.14,746.16, number of units in you that you refuse
746.28,755.31, so much heavier than the individual microorganisms so you still outweigh the microscans and your god but you do not outnumber them
755.43,757.77, each car in this tent
759.48,766.26, a person would times more foreign cells in her than her own selves
766.29,768.42, so you in a sense
768.99,805.5, walking ecosystem you are the carrier of a fantastic ecology inside of yourself with enormous amounts of organisms that do a lot of work for you in there that you provide also with the benches and the tables and the knives for the for the work because the fibre you eat in your food friends will will be where the micronesian will sit to digest all the parts of the food that you provide them with so even though you are sitting egoiste now you are you are you haven't you have other inside yourself and that is important because you can prove grantha other inside yourself
805.53,819.45, one kind of food you have one kind of microbe and this dominating the ecosystem within you if you eat another kind of food and other kinds of microbes are not special of microorganisms will dominate your god
819.84,829.65, a program is like a computer you're god is like a computer that you can program in different ways and of course if you give it the same macdonald bertall the time
830.01,842.7, have also a very dull system inside and now i come to the problem that i want to address in this language that the problem of industrial agriculture or the problem of
842.79,870.96, in cultivating the planets in their own image because they have not yet heard of all engagements revolution that we've started earlier today that we try to make the world pleasing to us and make the world to exactly what we want make it easily edible estoient through the cultivation of plants through the way we process these plants and so on which there try to make things so that there not challenging for us to eat
871.98,877.32, project is historically to cultivate the process to prepare
877.32,887.04, so ladies very easily into our body that praise a lot of problems for us in the sense of a wandering and so on but it also creates
887.13,924.33, no lack of joy because these things are become more more predictable more more the same all the time we never challenged the side so you could say that the problem with this kind of food is that that really not enough surprises really not enough difficulty in eating it really not enough chewing chewing also as a metaphor not only of what goes on in your mouth but also pardon in your system there's not enough there's not enough challenge him in that food it doesn't surprise you or unsettle you in any way so to come spring
925.26,931.32, therefore they also no diversity inside your god there's no rich ecosystem with thin you
931.32,934.92, and therefore not a lot of fantastic things to experience
934.98,952.26, so what is then the problem with the food that we could get from agriculture and i used it the world i would call to her to clean the modern industrialized big scale moral culture agriculture what is the problem of this agriculture it is a very simple problem
952.41,955.23, that the food we get from agriculture
956.16,969.06, icilius in the sense you present yourself with your own project your know what you're getting all the other nest has been taken out and therefore the problem with agriculture is that agricultural
970.44,974.31, you on your inside when you eat this kind of thing
974.34,976.59, that's a casting
976.59,980.58, it's like telling yourself to eat this
980.61,982.2, produce food
982.71,993.75, therefore my wish when i go into one of the restaurants that you are dealing with my wish esteros miasma being wanting something to eat my wishes a very simple wish
993.78,997.32, that is what i would like you to take on me
997.32,998.61, my inside
998.61,1006.83, these i would like you to challenge me i would not like you to please me or to make it easy to digest your meal
1006.89,1008.72, i prefer that you would
1009.2,1012.26, somehow challenged me with 
1012.5,1038.15, that is so surprising and so new to me that it will take i was offered a grasshopper alive grass over collected here by motoring for lunch and i had to bid it head off first and then see it and that really tickled all the way down so that wastefulness
1038.45,1044.18, as i'm proud to tell the story i'm not so sure that i was proud to experience the story at lunch 
1044.87,1049.67, i'm afraid that i am becoming on stage because it 
1049.7,1067.4, so i would like to add as my final word and slide here before you jump on me that it's on the inside i want to be at the thankyou
