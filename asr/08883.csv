1.05,7.41, here give you a quick demo of our new code controller it's a nice small compact controller
7.62,11.04, has a grid of eight by four
11.34,16.83, another that also work as push buttons and then you have
16.83,26.4, for buns all alongside of the rose in the columns of the codes the waving courser is pretty nice it like up and lading
26.49,29.76, see it her lighting up as i moved the code
29.79,34.29, in your position and also if i was to adjust it in the software
34.29,37.23, i would also update on 
37.29,38.64, itself
38.82,54.09, so it's relative to the settings in your software sense standard zero to want many data so it can be used as a useless man in and out jack see can use it as an analogie
54.66,61.98, i have it running or live just i can show you some basic stuff i can do of course it's
62.04,71.85, mesnard mine controller so you can use it with pretty much any software for audio production saying video
73.08,74.25, and
74.25,86.46, also is open source the form were for it is open source so you can if you're a program here you can modify the source and have to do a thing
87.0,104.79, so here let me just kind of show you how i have it set up here i live just to give you an idea of how it could be used courteous with anything not just live the way happens set up here as i have eight tracks at and then i have each of these which are also noble
104.79,107.43, and the first
107.64,109.83, and each row
111.33,115.56, one column rather controls the volume and that servitor that track
115.71,117.03, in the mists
117.03,128.58, this column here controls the master for the set this is my master volume and then i had these for 
128.67,140.19, the nice thing about these led rings is they give you an indication of where you are and they also light up green so when you're all the way at the maximum value alike of green
140.28,145.5, and then you know obviously when you're at the lowest point zero it turns off
145.92,148.5, they also each
149.1,151.53, but also has a light for
151.53,160.56, the button so that white like her showing me that this clip is playing if i trigger this one i have a quanti
161.58,171.24, it is now playing and now that cleanses forth so let me just play clip hearing you can see how i find a had the set up so i turned my volume up here
171.54,311.7, my master by other lilburne out of so have this setting different lips i now have i not have a clean or shareholders to work i would fasolt one tractatus attraction different lips in that drachenhausen of hers i have hebuterne a festooning on my effective effect race and the first column i had me repeat her set up sonorousness of that this is for intromissions the inherited so can see it's nice cause i'm goin drawingroom ahead and just start another track here so you can see how it works on a separate track i frequency shift or set up for the tracks of my facts this control the edrington of that effect thiostolf the elephant track up against my aconitine on not like on that soobachinee
311.7,315.06, you can see how all my stern down so there's nothing playing now
315.57,411.84, this is high when all the way up the seagreen with initiatory downstairs controlling the launch her sonnontoueronnons teetotallers and how the lads responded the editor to coronado use this with a lot of other programs is one to give you a kind of quick or view on what the possibilities are formed
