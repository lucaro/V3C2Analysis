17.55,47.46, one of my favorite things in public speaking is when some one else chooses the title if you if you choose the title yourself it says though you already know what you're going to say when some one else chooses the title he gives you a moment to reflect and sometimes reflect deeply and this case the title ukraine from propaganda to reality has indeed caused me to reflect deeply on what i'd like to do in the next forty or forty five minutes as share some of these reflections
47.64,60.9, you now these will be reflections about ukraine they will be reflections about russia about europe about the state of contemporary politics but in the end and i hope a bit throughout they all speegle tions about us
61.14,90.99, about what it means for us that we would start with propaganda and only then struggle our way towards reality what it is about the present moment when a title like this could attract a crowd like you to listen to this lecture so is as paul was kind enough to say i am a historian and in many ways a very traditional and conservative old fashioned one so before i get to the propaganda which there going to be plenty
91.11,99.03, i want to start with a tiny bit of historical reality a tiny tiny bit of centering of our attention on ukraine
99.09,141.45, of all european nations if the respectable have thousand year histories that's a nice round number if you can't make it to you know like the greeks or six thousand like the jews at settle for one thousand a thousand year history sounds very nice all european nations have a story about this ukraine has a story as well to story of the capital city which is kit i'm going to try to bring across to you some of the central date some dicentra events just not because we can really do with thousand years of history in three minutes but because we might be eyetalians unfamiliar what we know what we don't know the ways that we can get into this history in the ways that it might remain a little bit opaque
141.54,186.48, the city of key of the rulers of the converted the christianity in which is a conventional date for the gain of history because in general christians wrote things down were losing the habit now admittedly but for a long time we wrote things down one of our horses this kennaston the way the rest mellowness a trade route from the baltic to the black sea along the way you can remember epigraphy there is nepenthe city of kit for the vikings were on the way from north to south
186.48,223.2, this was a trading post the vikings have a bad name of course when you think of vikings we think of rape and pillage and other things that are are preoccupations but let's remember the vikings had other preoccupations they were trying to re establish european trade very sensible thing to be doing what they found in keith was a deccan hat known as hazara run by people called the hazards who were doing something very interesting at the time i recommend it as a parlour game if you have time this afternoon they were trying to your laughing belinda's going to be you must be really hard up for games caoline this town 
223.29,225.42, the
226.56,250.53, i spent a lot of my teenagers here again you don't even know what you're laughing at your laughing that's what the house as did it right at around this time was tried to decide which monotheistic religion there going to convert to the invited in scholars of from the day craithers tradition tradition
250.59,355.86, which means display what we learn in school or herschel or ever i might be there actually was a jewish state between the fall of the temple and israel but you can draw conclusions you like from this but as soon as the converted to judaism they disappeared from history and were immediately tolistoboies a country called russia that this word arouses a very old word in the beginning had nothing to do with russia or ukraine because there was no russian ukraine there were no russian or ukrainians the people like that were going to exist for almost another thousand years use was initially this very interesting amalgamation of likings and hazards and surrounding sobbing people to whose culture the liking loathsomeness adoring to establish a trade out for mongolia to europe admittedly along the way you know there were certain regimes which were at which they found to be problematic and they destroyed them all but what they were really trying to do is to establish a trade route and they got as far as of you who have read
355.89,398.76, the big classic histories of our poor member they got as far as the eastern europe they defeated publish armies hungarian armies and they also wiped out roots the reason why the reason why we don't all remember the basutos the commander of the armies or worship him for that matter that's as possible the reason don't all remember him is because of an accident of succession which caused he and his armies to go back to mongolia for a funeral if they hadn't done that no doubt those little horses would have been watering themselves in the sand and european history wouldn'ter exist that chicago humanised have entirely different fondness
398.79,448.29, the next day that i'll try to do ortent on as fifteen sixty nine now fifty sixty nine is an interesting moment it is the time of the creation of what was then the largest state in europe something called the police lithuanian commonwealth of digest which includes what's now the baltic states most of them poland bellerose ukrainian a bit of russia a very a very large state and the reason i mentioned this entity is because it helps us to see a kind of continuity soulie and twentieth entertained
448.35,540.66, on not everything to integrate the culture remains they had a very interesting language of law which was called chancery slavonic it came from something called church slavonic which was invented by calamitous for religious purposes of conversion the rose had law which is no small thing right rushahead law code and these things went to where they went to lithuania they went to the grand utilitarian the grand duke of lithuania who were for clad pagans took on all of this for themselves as they took on the lands of what had been roseanne expanded southwards towards the black sea and itself became the inheritor of rose territorially and intellectually right of most of the territory of rose of the western part the more eastern part remained under monocentral and that more eastern part where the main town was something called moscow becomes the origins of a state called muscovy and later the russian empire so rose gets divided up and the westernmost parts faint lithuanian lithuania and intern dandoins poland and in fifteen sixty nine you have this grand this grand european state to i mentioned that because also within this european state kiaks part in all of the major european traditions all of the things that we think about as being the hamako european intellectual cultural social history the gothic even a little threatening all of these things whether it's architecturally intellectually theologically
540.9,592.29, the territories there now ukraine pass through them okay so another day then just as i sent quite doing this in three minutes but i'm trying another date that i would ask you to keep in mind is now by the middle of the century there of the winning commonwealth has ceased to exist which means that all of its territories have been divided among more modern empires and austrian one german one rungheehe is around the time that a ukrainian movement has begun to assert itself first in the russian empire timeserving west towards keith which is now the capital and finally moving further west towards leviathans ukraine this national movement
592.38,646.53, was very typical of you of the european national movements in th century i will say something very typical historians when i say that all of these national movements are essentially new trade mark of national histories is that you say that your old because you netherlanders mastered
646.62,766.68, you know especially long distance ones right and our relationship with europe is a long distance relationships so it could go on for a while anyway the point of this is that ukraine in th century was rather typical there were intellectuals who were trying to consolidate a language use it as an instrument for gathering the masses around them hoping for an opportunity in politics and this opportunity and politics was also no atypical for ukrainian as for eastern europe the opportunity smote first worthier sergeant where things were possible to suddenly were possible before right the result of the defeat of the hapsburg the austrian monarchy the dearest russian empire meant that no nation states could be formed right and this was american policy or umber wilson would resonant this was everybody's polytheistic and morally that the natural response to the enemies we had a declaration were were in large or becomes this is new scatteration states but not ukraine not ukrainians is worth things become a bit interesting because it's not the case that ukrainians didn't suffer and die and more of independence on the contrary they suffered in ingrate large numbers and extremely complicated was the city of key for example was occupied twelve times twelve times may be thirteen over the course of the civil wars the falernian patriots involving the polish army which actually got as far in may nineteen twenty aethereal by the way when they got to the polls as you know were excellent horsemen and when they got to kitty stayed something which was sort of typical of polish foreign policy than now and forever which is that
766.8,790.47, they marched their horses down the main avenue of kawachi you ever been there is called the besotted marched the horses all the way down right is beautiful fantastic and seemingly endless and the reason why i was seemingly endless was that they made a circle and they came back around it so the appear that there was this massive polish army but in fact it was like a film going to know him over over and over again
792.51,811.65, he quickly driven out my polish friends i love you all and now you're out here okay so but the point the larger point is that ukraine was it ukraine was nominated position after the first war there are many claimants upon it polish as well as ukrainians well as communist as well as imperial russian
811.65,841.92, and at the end of it all and let's pick as a date here when the soviet union was for at the end of it all most of what is now ukraine was became part of the soviet union so here you can history tells of a little bit you know in a certain easterly direction away save from polish at towards a point which i would define in the other point and may be the most important one maybe the most significant intruders and the politics of myth
842.19,893.58, now in two things are happening that a very relevant for the lands that are now ukraine the first is that we are at the height of stallings attempt to make a revolution inside the soviet union to make what stoical a second revolution a social revolution not the political revolution of nineteen seventeen but the social revolution the economic revolution which racially push the soviet union and its people's head on to the right track of history turned the soviet union from a backward country as they saw it into a progressive industrial country which meant taking the peasants who are the majority of the population of the land getting them into the factories getting memoriter children to the factories if not into the cool and turning out would have been productive of very often as a ukraine privately owned farmland into state on cooperative
893.61,937.71, this was a very difficult process because you know a midwestern don't have to be told people who own private land tend to want to keep it into look to and the upon it being taken away so there was a certain amount of resistance to this the resistance was met with vehemence brought about food shortages all over the soviet union but those food shortages that hunger was channeled politically into certain places and ukraine was a place to which it was most obviously and as a result of more than three million people starve to death in ukraine in the course of safety
937.77,955.38, and the policy is something that stolen called internal colonization that you explain what you have inside your own country nor to move the entire country in direction you want at the same time that stanesky been tenantless also thinking of colonizing ukraine in a slightly different way and that is our
955.38,958.74, so nineteen thirty three is also the year that hitler comes to power
958.86,1063.11, and hillary comes to power with a program of i mean precisely lamenting space what is living space mean geographically it means above all ukraine ukraine from hitler's point of view as interestingly from stains is the very rich very fertile bit of ukrainian territory european territory which is important to be controlled because if you can to it you can be self sufficient and you can be self sufficient than income a great power it's about breaking out of just being a german nation state and to becoming some kind of grand new german empire and along the way german planners imagine that when they moved east when they invade the soviet union when they destroy it in the first winter after the war there going to starve tens of millions tens of millions of soviet citizens to death so the nineteenth three i mentioned symbolically as a way to emphasize that ukraine is in the middle of not one but two interior interieure colonization projects i can't tell a whole story here it's in the book woodlands which paul was kogieschquanohel the stationers of war and of course military casualties themselves this was the most dangerous place in the world to be now
1063.17,1180.53, i'm getting towards the present is another moment where ukraine is at the center of history the soviet union was created largely because of ukraine ride the soviet union if we remember we called it russia but it was in russia it was a union of a number of nominally federal units right russia was one of the ukraine was a second most important and there was pleasantest soviet union was assembled it was assembled because there was a ukrainian national question the reason it wasn't just some vague social thing with no internal boundaries was because the people who created leaderettes was going to rain so just as you bendelaine also bellowed in the cumberlands now the next moment when you ran is at the center of european history is today but before we get to wantonly european experience to have some contact with german occupation it's another typical european experience to have some contact with soviet
1180.56,1247.79, ukraine is characteristic in the has both right or take colonization that's a very typical of european history right that's what europeans did for a couple of centuries but to be colonized inside europe is a bit more right that's a bit more intense that's something that's something new different but not less european history in a way it's the second that treasurership ruthless with them but we have matterhorngletscher we were here the whole time
1247.91,1278.9, no that might not seem so you know conceptually interesting worth pointing out i noted though because that's not how all nations think in fact there's a particular contrast between the ukrainian seat the way they see their history were always history organized the shortest
1279.62,1310.76, so it's much abstract it's not about how we were always here it's abstract requires a certain kind of narrative which jumps around areas of miles in space right but it's a very successful narrative i'm sure many of you study that in college not realizing that it you know a myth which is just as of as other myths are so there's a difference in the way that russia and ukraine see a common history and a very imposing
1310.88,1337.1, the wire where the revolution where the crisis and ukraine started into thousand thirteen was not in the streets of kean it was not in the kremlin it started with a different understanding of europe if you are a student or a small businessman or something like this and ukraine in keith you understand your open the following leg
1337.46,1376.1, europe has somehow been part of our history this is not disputable right and europe to day means the european union which means in turn bureaucratic predictability and the rule of law which are the things which ukrainians do not have and that is why the association agreement which i know from our distant perspective might do seem like some boring trade packed but that is why the association agreement with the european union men so much to so many ukrainians last year because they saw it as a pathway out of the problems they have which i have to do chiefly with corruption into a rule of law
1376.16,1453.83, in simplifying a lot but from a contemporary russian point of view europe can look very different europe can look like something where you can ask the question are we european or not and we have pollington this by the way he's not just me bein like historically mythical right now the number of russians who say they are european when asked is down to eighteen whereas in ukraine is edging towards percent which is a big difference it assanti difference so do you anaesthesia ask the question are we european or are we asiatics back to the th century or even before ancient really a question and from a russian point of view where your great power you can look at europe and you can say you can i don't think it's right and solitary can look at europe and say we're a great power there great power there are rival there are adversary and ukraine you simply can't do that you're too small you need your opinion something but if your russia you can decide that your sarria and you can decide that you can cavere this rival and you can criticize this rival which is what starts to happen indeterminate european the european civilization of the european union as decadent
1453.89,1498.59, and this is tied into the russian campaign against homosexuality by the way because europe is characterized as being decked in which means homosexual or homosexual which means decadent and so this plays into domestic politics right in domestic politics in russia as well so you can see that i just now to point out some divergences which actually proceed the crisis and in some sense in it the crisis as one statement president botheration know that threat was but an event there was a radical shift in position
1498.59,1605.93, ukrainian students began to protest students because they're the ones who have the most to gain from predictability in the future they actually came out because i'm this is a very sort of nice modern moment they came out because of a face book post by a young journalist who happens to be of muslim afghanistan which had more or less thistlethwaite expression the prettiest benedetto children but the use of violence actually meant at the protest spread across the incineration but across regions across political affiliations the gathering on independent square which is known in ukrainian interestingly from an arabic or persian word as the manhattanese shorthand finally led to a revolution no
1605.99,1774.32, i explain what i think this revolution really means i will explain what i think is happening and also what this war that we see before isaurians before i do this i want to explain to you what i think the revolution suffered incessant now as i speak to you preparedness to you there's a humanitarian crisis and pulling millions of people which is unfolding in south eastern ukraine right now as i speak to you so how you cranians saw it as the most important thing in outmaneuvering from what i call all articles to real pluralism so you crane is an oligarchical country not just in the sense that were becoming one right i mean this way ukraine is our future it really is hatteras fiction you know and close your eyes a tiny bit and you are almost there it really is a country where you know zoophite question the real question there is and this is a question in america face of course right egotistically but that's what the rule of law means it means that if you are a little guy you know if you're the little sonlessness was a middle class revolution it was kind of reuton at any of you people do some of you actually did take part in it's a kind of unreality through moralisations current regimentation which there are lands but all the lands are beholden at least the time being to the presidency that is to the regime of president putin this means that civil society in ukraine or a revolution in ukraine or protest and ukraine
1774.32,1846.44, as a threat not only to the ukrainian order but a threat in a different way to the russian order because if you're trying to centralize power then you don't like then you don't like civil society in fact you might like it even less and that's the simplest connection the simplest reason why russia invade intervened or had intervene and ukrainian in urination but what i want to try to suggest is that is that the issues are much deeper and much influence intermitted to find ourselves olympic about all of this is certainly true that one one can continue this story of the revolution on the midafternoon that president who refused to sign the association agreement that president under whose auspices several dozen people were shot lets
1846.47,1913.4, there are then three inferior tic presidential elections in ukraine in may then a couple of weeks ago there were free and fair parliamentary elections and ukraine ukraine is moving towards a kind of much more clearly western normality at least on the political level the three leading parties in the parliamentary elections all prostrated in ukraine in a double way it invaded occupied in the next the crimean peninsula which was the southernmost territory of ukraine and it is currently fighting a proxy and real war in the south eastern ukraine in regions or blast known as one and lubricates the war which is going on to day russian troops are on the roads as we speak along with russian tanks armored now we're getting to the real subject and now are into the thoughts which i want to try to share with you in the next ten or twenty minutes sat
1913.43,1993.02, what is interesting about what's happening i want to say a word about tactics i want to get say where about strategy i want to say i say what about philosophy and what i want to try to convince you of and all this that is that what the stakes of what is happening are not just some you know some minor struggle in a far rayonette word because what russia has done in its war in ukraine is tactically innovative and interesting and its provender rather effectively rather effective what i would call it is reverse a symmetrical warfare so asymmetrical warfare means the weapons of the week if you are a partisan army or if you are civilians if you were on the weaker side if you were terrorists your fain your facing some big conventional army asiatics what you do right you do things which are not so coshering which break the laws of war you disguise yourself a civilian you hide amongst civilians you break the rules on the battle field you fight piegans in your run that's a symmetrical warfare right not agree in your gondola by the rules pecan you have an argument why that's okay which is that your small and weak in your opponents begins
1993.2,2098.44, what russia has done is its reverse thus russia is big and strong at least compared to ukraine in the russian army compared to ukrainian there can in army is overwhelmingly strong and yet and yet the russians have chosen to fight as it were an asymmetrical war inside ukraine rather than declaring more and just overwhelming opponent which they which presumably they could do they have chosen to fight and they clearly planned to fight this odd reverse a symmetrical worsening of some examples how did they invade crimea they sent troops in unmarked uniforms right which is both a symmetrical warfare when you send troops and you say that they're not yours in their front civilians from the local population there's no division going on which is of course what they said but also its intended only state can produce thousands of identical unmarked uniforms right and in thousands of identical unmarked came personnel carriers and tanks so it's this reverse a cemetery we're not we're not going to take responsibility but clearly a state is behind it the way the war has been prosecuted in the southeast or is being prosecuted is very similar saintlier own troops when necessary but generally what they do is the train people in tactics of partisan warfare so the local separatists trained and accompanied by russians are fighting wars from cities right but as the classic partisan tactic because then you draw the fire of your opponent into the cities which alienates civilian population brings in tortures thathanabaing to present itself as the weaker side it's choosing to pretend that there's no war on right
2098.5,2132.82, right now literally everyone knows that there are i mean literally everyone knows even the people who deny it now in fact they know it best of all that there are russian troops inside ukraine that there's russian armor in ukraine that there's more now than there was when i started my everybody literally everybody knows that and yet they will not they will not only not say they will go to extraordinarily confluent deny it which is interesting what is it all mean i mean i think what it means is that russia is attaching itself to the story that they are on the earth small gainst the week guy that really what's going on here
2132.85,2154.3, not a word russia against ukraine right which could seem like something unfair and illegal not to mention brutal unnecessary and counter productive but what's really going on is a russian defensive struggle against the overwhelming might of the united states which is a theme to which i'm going to return so i think they're tactics are related to that over all way of presenting things now
2154.42,2249.13, as they do this they have an interesting way of talking about their strategic goal the way they talk about their city to go is to describe it as those are happened which is the end of the ukrainian state one in five or six different ways rusheth rites have talked about the nonexistence of the ukrainian state they've said that russia and ukraine really one nation pontchartrain state that there was a ukrainian state but that it ceased to exist which is how they explain whether or not being treaties rights we signed it with ukraine but yukinari therefore the tree no longer binds us all this business about you may have heard it about nototherboc in some respects might be better in some respects might be worse but you see how the series when i put it that way right we know that culture doesn't actually match up with political boundaries once you say that it does your denying the reality of political boundaries originating stentoriously even though its unconventional and new and therefore easy to dismiss
2249.19,2293.02, i would call this strategy strategic relativism and its principle is this if you are absolutely not that strong which russia is in is not on a world scale if you have real demographic in technological limits if a lot of your financial power is based on fossil fuels necessarily find it you are limited compared to let's say the united states or european union or most terrifyingly china you have rule limits how do you overcome those limits you can't make yourself absolutely stronger but you can make other people relatively and i think it's a sight which is at the root of the new russian strategy of strategic relatives what you do since other people's power is based
2293.05,2364.87, and you were alone your attorney operating alone your flexibly your fast you can do what you want what you do is you try to break down those connections and once you noses this as an overall strategy on approach to the world than a lot of the pieces began to line up and make sense so at the biggest level disrate relativism is about the transit medications it's about the relationship of the united states and the european union something which can be attacked for example by leaking telephone conversations of high american officials where they talk out of context about the european union it's something was an be weakened by the propagation before america is behind everything which happens in ukraine which confuses some europeans in good faith usually in bad because if we are behind it all therefore it's not their responsibility they don't have to dorsetshire mentioned has been characterized for more than a year now as dead and torn
2364.93,2396.28, i know you are i know you are and the sort of pleasant like that but what decadent actually means is to it means destruction from within it means raw it's a story with an end so when you say that something else something is decidement that it's coming to an end and that's exactly what is meant by this russian description of your patagonian policy is designed to bring that in about as quickly as possible the destruction of the ukrainian state is a destruction of europe in itself because the whole european order is based upon territoriality
2396.37,2417.97, and also because the project of european integration is based upon the project of integrating not peoples but states so if you can be state up then you can also break up the project of a larger union but it goes a little bit deeper than that the russian campaign against ukraine has been accompanied in his innocence whatsoever by a very interesting russian recruitment of the european far right
2418.21,2459.37, on the surface you could say well this is because putain has an anti hammou campaign and they don't like gas and so on there are some ideological overlaps but the real substantial overlap is that the european far right by which i mean the populists and of people to the right of the populists the facts and the nazis are all against the european union project as is plutina now have a very substantial relationship very substantial which involves for example members of the european far right going to monitor the elections which were justice
2459.4,2492.52, i'm going to see the acorn is energy russian power depends upon the sale of hydrocarbons the european union is aware of this and as the european union will eventually get it together and have some kind of long term energy policy as germany italy luxemburg switzerland sweden norway and so on they will not will not away will on because they've got tons of betterments but the individual european countries will always be very weak compared to russia there always be dependent on sturgeon
2492.64,2521.98, now from this point of view the destruction of ukraine whichever any mentioned becomes part of a much larger view of things which i'm going to editors calling a philosophy that the attempt to break up the madame to break up the revolution begins to seem not just like an attempt to break up something which might be threatened if if it were exported and copied in russia which of course it is a threat for that reason but also as a deeper kind of threat representing something which i would call civil society
2522.16,2573.76, the the underlying philosophy i'm going to editors talking about this philosophy marks placidly but the underlying philosophy of this of the states relativism is that there aren't any real connections they don't really exist they might seem to exist but they don't really exist there as some hidden hand behind it all in fact it's if you listen to put carefully or not so carefully it's an american hidden hand behind it all there aren't really people who would go out and take risks and suffer and spend a night and uncle pavement in december there are really such people the only painters ever inactive of the world terror
2573.76,2600.73, now where this comes from you know whether it has to do with god and caesar not a training for i know captaining where this come the comes from soviet experience i don't know but i think it is a way of seeing the world and the terrible true 
2600.73,2651.97, not true that there are no free associations it's not true they are all here because you know you are paid by exile or whatever it's not true that i'm here because i'm part of some you know lurching american conspiracy we all here for our own individual reasons and together we make up a group and that civil society and something rather wonderful and beautiful it's not true that there's no such thing but you can make a world in which there's no such thing you can break these things up from the inside or from the outside that can be done that's what soviet history basically shows so even if you're wrong in your diagnosis you can still be as it were correct in your in your prognosis you can easily of understanding because i think what is actually happening is based upon a recantation i want to close by trying to define what i think that difference in philosophy really is
2651.97,2701.2, i would call it and you can just like all my fancy words like the artic relativism and the reverse a symmetry and so you can just forget all of those right i'm just but they're just labors of arguments which i'm trying to make clear i would call this a kind of applied post modernism okay what any post modernism aside from like the dominant trend of my education you know in the what are i mean my pommerais of seeing reality as being fragmented where words and things don't have any necessary connection to each other and that's all finding good so let me give an example you all know let's say you're looking at an advertisement for a display at grocery store and they are beautiful parnassus
2701.2,2731.38, now think about what that really means it doesn't mean for illustration purse it's not actually an illustration what for illustration purposes means is that this stuff is not in the store right not to tease store or like if you case so let's see like to watch as for bemperlein they go up you know they go up mountains and the buildings they go in of a possible stuff right and the first thing i say is professional driver closed coarseness
2731.44,2764.89, demonstration purposes only which means precisely the opposite it's not illustrating anything this can't actually happen it's not demonstrating anything either i can't actually happen right this is the post monroe live in that we take for granted that these words mean the opposite of what they seem to know a couple of weeks ago and there was a man propaganda campaign which most likely came from russia in which thousands of people around the world received emails with atrocity photo having to do with the supposed ukrainian mistreatment of prisoners of war and the flyer came with the photo and the photo was of a second world war a german
2764.92,2775.69, so that's propaganda very bad when we people who sent out that flyer were queried about it there official response was yes that picture has nothing to do with the subject
2775.9,2846.13, for illustration purposes only so this is what i mean by a piper is we should think i'm getting this sort thinking about how far when we are from all this all right a second example of this modernism is marketing politics as marketing right which all familiar with so the two kinds of russian propaganda which i've already mentioned each has a market when the russians say it's the ukrainian and particlerly do kind of tend to think that america's behind everything and therefore if it's geoponica struggle then maybe we should be against america rather than russia and most insidiously if it's a geoponica struggle that just removes all of the ukrainians from the picture entirely right if it's all about some chessboard between america and russia you know where it's just guys in ties in the kremlin you know in the pentagon thinking about things then there are no real ukrainians or are no rubenstein people suffer
2846.13,2878.17, the idea which they started out with that the ukrainians are a fascist that had a market right the market was all of us who are concerned that the greatest danger comes from renewal of fascism of romanticism if you just say your enemy is a nostrand over in which some of them still do i mean the pride the deputy prime minister of russia who himself is no friend of the left actually had his party and because of your adversaries history he refers to the ukrainian still
2878.17,2931.87, the fascist nazi hot faces not to hunt and someone has taught him that every time he refers to them instead of saying ukraine he should say fascinated and if you say it over and over again people might start to think it's possible if you say the enough times a sort osorios right notes titanically he's aiming for a market and in the point about all this is that it it works he may not be convinced in the end but it slows you down it certainly sos you down the very minimum it creates a slippery world let me give you a third example of post modernism which may okayondonghsera
2931.93,2966.64, each of them present five different variety versions of what happened one of which may even be true right but it doesn't matter because when you hear the five different versions at the end of it you have no idea what actually happened be the event itself has been trivialized by the ridiculous discussion and see you may be lost a little bit more of whatever faith you might have had in journalism right and that is intentional so in russia to day or other russians discussed for example the shooting down of the malaysian airlines flight ever ukraine which was a real event
2966.76,3008.79, in which real people lost their lives but the matron out about it like this malaysian airliner was the same on the disputed over the pacific or this malaysian airliner was launched from its runway with dead bodies who are putting their but the cia or this ukrainian airline was actually shot down by ukrainian fighter jet or maybe an american fighter jet oriskany put enough of this stuff out there right then people mirrable it you're going to be honoured
3009.21,3016.17, this is how it works right that you give these multiple views and at the end something which really matters
3016.26,3086.91, that the tragic death of children and women and men to which really matters at the end of it it becomes nothing and in the end anyone in journalism any more and that's what's intended that's the final war this postpones works now the already sort of testing you to see how deep this has gotten into us and of course it did does could come from us in some considerable measure and i'm getting back towards our title which is from propaganda to reality where the question is where are we really in all of this and how much of this comes from and how much of it reaches us now where this ultimate no such thing of truth through the thornthwaites
3087.03,3113.64, you might think now that's ridiculous professor snyder of course we follow the principle of non contradiction we don't allow ourselves to contradict ourselves on daily basis and if somebody else did we catch it immediately on its let's see let me recite some things from russian propaganda about this war which you hope will have all heard probably in one way or another because the american media happily is up most of the stuff in me outside a couple of things in the eye
3113.73,3124.71, you've heard there's no ukrainian state you've also heard the ukrainian state is very repressive you have heard there is no ukrainian nation
3124.77,3159.72, also heard little ukrainians are nationalists you have heard that there is no ukrainian language you also heard that russians are being forced to speak ukrainian language most most disturbingly referred that russia's fighting a war to save the world from fascism and you also heard that may be fascism isn't such a bad thing after all almostly how much of that did you pick up how much of the fact that the entire propaganda campaign from maine and was not just wrong
3160.38,3166.17, but self contradictory honestly how much of that was clear to all of us at the time i think
3166.89,3179.76, surprisingly and depressingly little and this is the place where i want to try to bring this to an end we are at a point where
3179.88,3297.42, i really think we are at a point of to be or not to be for the west what have you might think of as the west this policy is strategic relativism of bringing down the various kinds of connections that exist the transatlantic oneness themselves solstitial about us as well the policies against sissie interestingly are not just being pursued on the maidan or in russia where egos are banned or forced to advertise themselves has been for agents they are also pursued here in russian money is used to fund non governmental organizations here and then the russians revealed that their doing this and then we all become skeptical about non governmental organizations thereanentis probably good time to say so probably good time to try to support those things there are sensible policies i think the best ruspoli is a good ukraine polytheistic whereas
3297.57,3374.34, the asymmetry strategy the relativism and then philosophy the post modernism but really the philosophy is also the tactics the philosophy comes first if you buy into this version of pomoerium then you are going to also buy into the state relativism and then you're going to lose a whole lot of asymmetric battles which is a description of what has happened in the last year in large measure not description of ukraine in russia the ukrainians are actually much more savvy about these things than we are of course mahdinah more experience with them is not ascription of ukraine in russia is a description of a adscripti of us if we buy in to this kind of way of seeing the world which is in part are waiting the world we had a good hand in generating it then there are certain consequences like that there will be wars there will be broken orders he will be chosen
3374.58,3454.47, no there an authoritarian state has invaded a democratic state destroying a european order it will not that complicated it happened that way the reasons why we find a complicated or largely reasons which have to do with us with our vulnerability to certain kinds of propaganda and not and not really with reality so ultimately as you is a challenge i mean if you want to be optimistic and interesting challenge but i think a serious moral intellectual challenge in which the people who come up with these ideas nouchette than we know them these are serious intelligent people have to be taken seriously in at the moment dingwell and what concerns me is the extent to which this event in ukraine which is important in all kinds of ways has given way precisely to this yielding moment in our own in our own culture because after all if we see what's happened in ukraine as nothing more than just some little conflict in some far away country if we see this is just a kind of politics as usual well then propaganda has already won and realised the stories are
