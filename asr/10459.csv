0.03,97.86, my name is keith wiser i'm excited to be with you here to day lead pastor here is nature and we are in the middle of a series called breaking history so this is the middle of three and i want to give you a little bit of a head about where we're going or extension be something you are not going to nominees of starting a church we need the right staff together we need to have the right people so we wanted to have a lead pastoralists and his servant series it is going to be blowing in a whole lot of ways is called read really it's talking about how there are some things that we think that we're going after the things that satisfied so we are asking reinterpretation besetting to be blowing the regal away going shanesville along longenecker forsooth
97.98,132.84, the scripter basically this that we have a way of thinking about making decisions about our life that happens in terms of the things that have happened to our past effect the way that we have an experience our life right now and really the trajectory of our life in the future and when we begin to understand that we are doing now is not rational the things that we have in our life were not crazy we're just dealing with these and lighthouses and will shape our future and really as we do understand what is the watelai
133.02,198.48, is that the way our past has shaped us as i have to be what defines us in the future and we talked about that last week in terms of identifying shame and ultimately as we begin to see a picture of jesus interacting with this woman at the well drawing out that shame in being able to say if you can't reiterating that delighted jesus is the ultimate solution to that we begin to think about ostentatiousness really mean what is this really look like and i want to get into this today and i want to introduce a concept that is the very core of christianity deteriorate and debated what if any was the unique christian thing was unique to the christian faith
198.54,215.88, may begin to eliminate possibilities by incarnation that was something that other religions had different versions of god appearing in human form the resurrection again other religions had accounts of people who had returned from death the debate went on and on until a guy named louis wandered into the room
216.21,245.88, is the guy who at the story about the line chronicles of nana maybe you've heard of him is made into movies mayor not one some movies okay so he wrote him he said he said this he says what's the rumpus about because of course singletrees colleagues were discussing christianities unique aspects among world religions and lewis when knotting
246.36,317.73, and that brought the roman to agreement see god's loving coming to us free of charge no strings attached seems to go against every instinct of humanity the buddhist eightfold path the hindu doctrine of karma the jewish covenant the muslim code of law each of these has one thing that's in commonest earn god's approval of us the way the aethereal only christianity dares to make god's love unconditional so here's what i want to know when we say apply jesus to this one we sideway jesus is at the center of this what were really talking about is this idea of grace and how jesus brings to us grace and how we operate in our lives this idea of grace and to understand facetiously there's a distance between what christian and be says it's about and at and how many people who said they followed jesus how they actually live
318.21,331.8, the second master resonate church a few years ago i was a finished my sermon the sheer vice kind of come to a close and i was backed by the sound both and this is in a different location for us
332.22,344.49, and i was sitting there and this girl comes up to me and her name is ruby and she got to that later on but the first thing she said to me was that she says she says i hate church
345.33,347.94, i don't really know about god
348.27,350.82, i really don't like christian holds
350.85,373.26, and it was like a nest great to me you like me too except for the church in the god think so there's a commonality that you and i share ruby and and that's on months things and really the really interesting thing is she began to come to this and akasha
373.41,376.56, she said i heard you talked about jesus
377.07,379.23, i think jesus is different
379.68,398.85, i'll be back and is this this fundamental thing of this difference between here is a distinctive of christianity that that nothing else shares this is as distinctive but the issue is that this is not distinctive of many people who follow jesus
399.24,420.18, this distinctive christianity but not a distinctive of christians see what i think has happened is a little bit like what happens when i grill food there's two ways right to grill food there's one there's a rub or your brush on the the saucer anything like that but the other way as you get a piece of meat
420.3,454.83, you marinated right and managing takes time you don't just say hey i want to eat and minutes i'm goin to marinate stuff because it doesn't work i've had your marinetti does it taste like the mindlessness right toinette whole point of amaranthine
455.04,504.96, this is his idea getting inside this idea that it has to get to the very core of us and i think that much of christianity has had a veneer of grace without the core understanding of what that really means as had a generous and what it means to live in this idea that jesus is unique among all other people that christianity is unique but living a life that is not unique to anything else that we see in it but i want to antoinette to
505.08,545.97, in this room in terms of our understanding of grace maybe you say it man i've never really been raised up in the church maybe i've not really had this idea planted had this idea of cultural grace and so there's this idea of cultural grace and cultural grace is something that like you know when you don't necessarily pay your rent on time that there's a couple of days you know wherefore have a deadline and i would pay on that dead line but i didn't quite do it and so could you just give me a little
546.09,575.34, grace right and we have this idea and it's always bound by time so i just can't go on and on right or you'll fall on your bills and get sent to a collector it's not you know it's not a huge amount of things it's just it's just a bit nottinghamshire grace
575.58,580.53, maybe here here and you've been to church and you've heard about grace
580.59,592.68, theoretically understand grace but the unique doctrine of christianity is not a distinguishable quality of your life you believe grace in theory
592.89,595.68, she don't live out grace and
595.71,596.91, practice
598.23,600.12, there's a third type
600.21,602.16, to get to that a little bit later
603.36,608.31, i think that there's this deep need for us to understand this for it to be
608.31,620.31, evading our lives and i think many of us have this have been near of grace but the core of who we are is more informed by our culture is more informed by other things will get into this what i want to do
620.46,647.52, is to see jesus jesus tells stories she says this if i tell you what grace is just objectively you're not going to get it because you'll take that definition and here's what she'll do you'll just apply this to the same kind of idea that your culture this is this what helps me to understand the way my culture perceives this what i need to do is to tell you stories or i need to show you a model grace to you and so that you can understand what extravagant
647.52,649.62, looks like
649.95,652.41, i want to look at the story today
652.41,667.05, and john eight about jesus modeling extravagant grace and how it kind of makes us uncomfortable and it can goes against everything that we believe is true and truthful in our world
667.08,669.39, jesus pushes up against this
669.39,675.48, so i want to get into this walk and john if you have your copy of scripture you can turn that you have your 
675.6,680.01, what i like to do i'd like to tell the story of john 
680.07,692.88, in a way that doesn't necessarily follow the scripture ad lorello this because i'm not trying to get outside of the scripture believe me that's a core truth of myself as in court truth of the doctrine of resonate church
692.94,695.97, i do want to tell you this and more of a story for
696.6,700.65, an look at it an john aid as i go along you see
701.79,702.84, he
703.74,705.24, woman
705.9,707.73, the center of the circle
708.75,710.64, men around her
710.67,712.83, all religious leaders
713.61,718.23, are the self appointed custodians of conduct
719.07,721.32, the other man the one in simple clothes
721.56,725.64, sitting on the ground the one looking at the face of the woman
726.42,728.61, jesus
728.91,731.25, he has been teaching in this
731.73,733.92, this courtyard
734.07,736.71, telling people with the kingdom of god looks like
738.06,739.59, the very same moment
740.55,742.32, place in that city
742.41,743.67, he's been cheating
745.26,748.29, here's the thing the far seas are out to stop both of them
749.31,754.26, teacher this woman was caught in the act of adultery
754.89,760.17, accused accusations ring of the courtroom cowall
760.86,763.77, but in the act of adultery
764.76,767.19, an open
767.31,769.74, she yanked back
770.88,777.9, that that place for them to be able to legally bring her into this place to be judged it wasn't just one person that had to see that but
778.23,779.28, people
780.81,782.13, might have been
782.55,785.07, on attend of this
785.73,788.7, invited someone else to see this
788.82,789.93, watched
792.69,796.41, in an instant she yanked from private passion
797.16,798.72, public spectacle
799.26,804.9, this man is not your husband put on something we know what we do with women like you
805.89,811.14, he spoke out of windows is a group pushed through the street dogs bark neighbours turn
812.07,814.08, city sees her as she
814.17,817.32, hide her nakedness with then she
819.45,821.31, nothing can hide her shame
821.91,823.2, she knows
824.13,827.58, he's known all along but there's going to be whispers
827.79,829.62, whispers whispers
830.49,832.65, stars at the ground
833.4,835.62, sweaty hair dangles
835.98,838.11, a riot with hurt
838.53,841.2, lips are jaws clenched
841.8,844.29, she knows she's been framed no need to look up
845.16,847.17, find no kindness
847.74,852.12, she looks at the stones in their hands squeezed so tightly that the finger tips are white
852.99,855.15, she thinks of running but where would she go
856.41,858.93, he could claim his treatment but to whom
859.5,863.31, she could deny the act but she was so keen
864.09,867.24, to get beg for mercy but these men offer none
867.72,869.55, this woman has nowhere to turn
870.33,871.68, there she
872.28,879.93, you expect jesus to stand and begin the sermon to proclaim judgment upon the hypocrites
880.38,881.34, he doesn't
882.93,886.89, hope that he would just snatch that woman up and just say let's get out of here
887.46,888.93, out of town
889.41,891.06, that's not what happens either
892.41,894.15, i move a subtle
894.78,897.33, its message is unmistakable
898.02,899.37, i 
900.6,902.58, jesus writes in the sand
903.3,905.34, say something he says this
905.91,907.83, if anyone here
908.13,909.57, without in
910.68,912.42, said the first stone at
914.4,916.5, the young to the old
917.46,919.65, to look into their hearts
920.19,922.38, they're the first to drop their stones
923.19,927.78, as they turned to leave the young who are cocky with their bow conviction through the same
928.17,931.62, the only sound that is heard is the pet of rocks
932.1,934.05, and the shuffle
934.59,939.33, then jesus in a woman are left alone with the jury gone
939.81,945.0, tom becomes the judge's chambers and the woman awaited the verdict
945.39,947.22, surely a sermon is brewing
948.36,951.06, no doubt that he will demand
951.06,952.35, apology
953.73,954.99, confession
957.72,959.46, some sort of repentance
960.42,962.25, the judge does it speak
962.46,963.69, his head down
963.87,965.79, still writing in the sand
966.54,969.33, they almost seem surprised when he realizes that she's still there
972.09,973.17, are they
974.64,976.65, as no one can be you
977.7,979.77, she answers no one sir
980.85,982.23, jesus says
982.59,984.3, i don't condemn you
984.69,987.54, go and leave your life
991.95,994.11, jesus made this something
994.41,996.3, radically outside
996.33,997.74, what a normative
999.0,1000.98, jesus did
1001.82,1003.62, almost disturbing
1005.18,1008.06, jesus displayed in that
1008.27,1010.13, extravagant
1012.41,1014.42, jesus is communicating
1014.81,1017.72, how he interacts with everyone
1018.8,1020.63, he comes in contact with
1021.23,1027.71, the first thing that i mean to understand about this is that gray isn't fair
1028.55,1034.4, isn't fair set kind of disturbing to me that jesus doesn't demand more out of her
1034.67,1077.18, when i began to process this outside of the viewpoint of grace i just say that's not fair all of these rules all these laws they were god saying this is how society is supposed to be together that that woman was fracturing some sort of relationship that there is someone on the other side of that who's world fellow part when she made the decision to engage in the act of adultery and that's not how we should live that nothing that is how things stand our society and what we do is westlotorn to see is that engravers
1077.54,1196.85, when someone receives something from someone else that was free we love these stories and they make sense when that person has esterly needed or won't really miss it but when it costs that person something it is a profound moment and it's even more interesting not only etherealised up with this idea that is not free and this goes against it blooming with a moosoo what you pay for there's no such thing as a free lunch over and over fair is a part of the way that we've you life and so we have an end but resistance to grace you resist grace because it is not fair in fact there's many people here that say that i'm not so sure that you're saying the right thing i i'm not so sure you're distorting scripture because this just can't be right this woman doesn't even repent and essays i don't condemn you how does that work that's not like anything else that i've ever seen in my world i've never even really understand religion in that way that just doesn't make sense but he's the thing we have to go back to this idea that we will always drift towards polestar clarity in that idea of where do i stand with god where do i stand with other people and we will always drift towards an idea of fairness not an idea of grace because it's in built into our society is in built into a person is always water useth decide of our destiny and the only way that you can decide your destiny and much of our minds is if the playing field is love and everybody does as they should write so then you can order and get ahead or you can loftiness
1199.28,1200.51, you see
1201.26,1202.52, i 
1202.79,1204.32, the world has jacked up
1204.47,1224.6, these things that are messed up and so this causes us a place where we don't know how to work in our life we don't know what this looks like and when we go back to life is fair being the mantra our life what it does is it brings us cynicism it brings us worry it brings us doubt
1226.64,1228.29, is it
1228.71,1230.63, free is fair
1231.35,1233.9, the second thing you need to understand his grace is a cheap
1234.32,1248.06, you see jesus what he does in that moment is something he stoops he stands in front of her judgment he takes that almost on himself and she goes and freedom
1248.96,1299.66, and again it's kind of this crazy thing but this is the mo of jesus this is what jesus does to the to the galoshes you're going to be with me to day in paradise to the guy who's lowered through the roof that one time in march says forgiven over and over these people are doing nothing to be forgivable for their sins and yet jesus is going through life saying i forgive you your free from this bondage all of this stuff why because jesus isn't just here to write jonathan right sister to just tell good stories jesus isn't just here to be the good teacher jesus is here to change the world dissertation to the cosseting up a dynamic that leads to his murderer
1300.86,1303.68, so that he
1303.83,1331.67, be the ultimate sacrifice that covers all of our sin and renders all of our verdict before god as not guilty so he can say to all these people here's a thing i know the score i know it i'm doing this is the whole plan i'm not just here to be the good teacher i'm here to be the saviour of the world and the saviour of the world can say to anyone you are not condemned your sins are forgiven and i want you to know that gray is never cheap
1332.42,1350.42, never cheap it's never like i didn't really need that anyway or it's not really a big deal no adult tree was a huge deal but what happens is she serves an even bigger god that she serves the author salvation jesus himself that she is underneath that
1350.84,1352.1, authority
1353.12,1354.74, so he can say to her
1355.52,1359.69, this will cost me your life so that i can say to you
1359.9,1361.4, not condemned
1362.87,1364.88, we need to know the whole story
1365.06,1368.24, grace just a shoulder shrug out a big deal
1370.31,1378.05, like people that give away stuff to good will thinking like oh you're so generous no it was just to craponne any more right
1380.75,1382.01, no great
1382.25,1389.36, costly this is the air leam that i most want to have but if i can help you in your life i will freely give it away
1389.66,1424.55, this is the grace that is offered to you and so what he says is is it begins to help us to understand what is this idea of grace what is this thing that has been sacrificed so when grace is understood and accepted unsentient of grace see it is god's action and light of his character that gives the gift of salvation to people who have done nothing to serve it through the costly sacrifice of his son jesus christ
1425.42,1431.12, and this always stands in juxtaposition from the idea of religion
1431.99,1444.62, we have not marinated in this idea of grace are hearts of not been changed we we've had this veneer we've had this rub of his idea of religious grace
1445.01,1461.18, nothing like gospel grace religion says that you should do this thing grace has don't you want to see every other religion says you need to be a good person because god loves good people christianity says you are not a good person
1461.24,1479.51, god loves you and by his grace he will change you so that you can be good through his son jesus christ you see oftentimes when we think about atwood or bad we measure up to the people that were next to that we measure up to the people in our lives we look at those who go to death how and say i'm better than them so i must be able to help
1480.59,1494.6, that's not the comparison that comparison is jesus and with the comparison of perfection of jesus christ we are all sinners and if you don't understand that you are a wretch so when they sing the song amazing grace
1495.62,1506.57, the lining is that saved a wretch like me not that saved a reasonable fellow that seemed to do more good than bad and yet somehow had sometimes had a bad day
1507.26,1509.09, not amazing grace
1510.17,1513.77, like mediocre grace to that person
1514.01,1515.27, not amazing
1515.69,1517.25, there's not much to worship
1517.91,1523.97, see what i want you to understand his religion and grace are radically different
1524.24,1533.45, see grace rightly understand that really understood radically changes those who receive it grace rightly understood radically changes those who receive it
1533.66,1553.34, you can never be good enough to paul tells us how how do you live then if grace covers you how does that change your life and i'm going to go through a block of scripture so holy this and romans say therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are pretty good people
1553.55,1560.33, now does it therefore there is no condemnation in those who try really hard
1561.83,1566.96, there's no condemnation for those who have been to church a lot there's no common a nation for people
1567.68,1569.9, mostly do right things
1571.94,1655.25, people who are moral not says this therefore there is no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus there is condemnation for those who are not in crises again we're getting what is the abbe marinated with the gospel because through christ jesus the law of the spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death for what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh god did by sending his own son in the likeness of central flesh to be a sin offering and so he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law may be fully met in us who did not live according to the flesh but according to the spirit there's like ten sermons in this but those who live in the flesh and their minds set on the white fleshed desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have mind set on with the spirit desires the mind governed by the flashes death but the mind governed by the spirit is life and peace and contagious because this is how grace takes over your life that it because something that not just a veneer of your life that you have this religious grace and is just kind of this idea that sometimes there's you know given tabby the time and how deeply the hurt was but there is this idea that jesus understands it when we experience grace were magnetically drawn to it it draws us in and i think that every time jesus revealed grace it
1655.28,1669.86, softened hearts it drew people in so he's saying is here's what i want from this woman i want her to understand grace so that her heart might be brought into this because she has a moment he says now go and do not send any more
1671.45,1711.35, does he say that how is that not just another law grace has been covered over everything and when he begins to understand the as you operate out of grace it draws you in you no longer live with this is what i ought to do but this is what i want to do and that is true freedom in your life that you begin to say this is what i desire that grace has drawn me to jesus not some sort of a promise of heaven or hell and really when we live that out when that becomes the distinguished backsliding idea of christianity in its best most compelling idea in the world
1711.65,1712.88, see
1712.97,1721.31, when you rely upon yourself to be acceptable it's all up to you but when you rely upon jesus it's all about grace
1721.64,1726.5, you see what jesus did was safe i'll take care of your sin
1726.71,1728.57, you take care of your shame
1728.72,1731.72, i'll take a deal with your sin
1731.75,1742.7, it is up to me and so the problem is too many of us we try to deal with our sin which i to make ourself right he will never be right enough and you could never try hard enough to do that you
1743.69,1751.16, submit to the grace given by you and allow jesus to deal with your shame to do with all septeuil never break history
1752.45,1757.94, so you do that how do you as a dear with your son you have to deal with your shame
1758.72,1762.56, you do that by understanding that a given you grace
1763.01,1767.72, so grace breaks your history by breaking religious rules
1768.35,1778.28, two things that rob us have experiencing grace one we don't really think that we're that bad and two we don't think that grace really covers everything everything
1778.4,1779.57, everything
1781.4,1783.32, the third thing i want to 
1783.5,1789.86, to tell you is that not only is grace not fair and costly but grace is about the person
1789.86,1790.97, gives it
1794.39,1797.24, communicate this story and says this
1798.5,1800.3, a young girl grows up
1800.63,1805.61, a cheery orchard just out just above traverse city michigan
1806.21,1813.74, parents are a bit old fashioned and they tend to over react turn nose ring the music she lessons too into the length of our skirts
1813.8,1826.67, ground or a few times and she sees inside i hate you she screams as that her father went he knocks on the door for room after an argument and that night she acts on a plan that she is mine rehearsed scores of times
1826.91,1828.14, she runs away
1828.56,1834.65, she's been in aderit only once before on a bus trip with her church youth group to watch attached the tigers play

2176.02,2177.85, banquets waiting for you 
2180.37,2181.99, see
2182.92,2185.17, the stories that jesus told
2185.89,2190.3, so accustomed to finding a catch in every promise
2190.6,2196.06, jesus stories of extravagant grace include no
2197.35,2200.89, no loophole disqualifying us from god's love
2202.27,2203.47, i see
2203.62,2205.66, this is jesus
2205.66,2211.06, ring extravagant grace that covers everything that is not fair
2211.9,2222.58, about jesus sociologists say that they have a theory of the looking glass self that you become what the most important person in your life thinks you are
2224.56,2226.0, my desire
2226.36,2228.55, is that in a culture
2229.03,2231.7, he has the you measure up
2231.7,2242.38, figure out what's fair just line yourself and compare yourself to other people that you will make jesus the most important person in your life and so that you would become like him
2242.5,2244.51, full of grace for yourself
2244.51,2249.58, grace is extravagantly spread to the people around you
2251.08,2255.43, there's one to become here's the third type of person
2256.54,2261.97, there are those of you who have long since left the notion that life is fair
2261.97,2274.78, you live towards others as christ has lived towards you you can't bear to hold a grudge you can't even think about bitterness forgiveness is a foregone conclusion in your life and grace graciousness ensues from you
2275.53,2283.57, all of this is from a deep understanding of an inexhaustible well of grace that has been given to you by jesus
2284.38,2286.36, so what if you
2286.63,2288.07, that kind of person
2288.13,2332.98, what a few were the person that drew from an inexhaustible well of grace and it was woven into every relationship it was infused into every conversation it was it was painted over it all of your past and incompletely created a trajectory to your future you exuded a divine hope and others and they are around you and when they were around you there flaws seemed to go away the rough edges were unseen their peculiarities were accepted and their humanity was celebrated think about the way that she would relate to yourself as some one who understands that grace is the very heart of the gospel the very currents that jesus dealt in and it would be silly to come here week after week and still operate under a different economy seemed grace must rule over everything
2333.94,2373.45, my heart is for people who have been near of grace but the core of them still operates on some sort of an economy based upon proving themselves to be acceptable before god before the other people where their paths are not forget their past or not forgivable and their futures tainted i want you to be people whose distinguishing marks of your life is the distinguishing mark of christianity that is a grace that is extravagant unfair costly focused on jesus coniferae that the spoors out of every port in your body you see those
2374.11,2376.33, this becomes normal
2376.72,2378.7, was that you deal with people
2379.33,2383.26, was that you understand the world becomes not by a contract
2384.82,2386.65, through the lens of grace
2387.55,2425.05, i see we have these baggage had the baggage in our life we have these things that we feel like we have to carry around and we have these things that we think this is just to imitate me and i just have to figure out how to deal with him and we all have that stuff that's just not for one or two people here have suffered by grace a costly grace that jesus one on your behalf so that you do not have to carry your pass with you said that you do not have to have something that you continue to carry around burdens in your life
2425.29,2430.0, she would understand that that has to be put down
2430.09,2431.92, because your future depends on 
2433.12,2448.57, and here's the thing i wish that my words just just telling you in this moment maybe you say that's who i want to be that though i want to live but the problem is you're going to go out these doors and you're going to get bombarded with a world that looks nothing like the grace of jesus christ in the gospel
2449.86,2454.39, to ask you to do this were you when you came in you had a little baggage tag
2454.45,2457.12, there was on your program did you pull that out
2462.64,2463.81, i can't
2463.84,2478.75, get into your head and say this over and over when you have those moments of doubt when you had that moment where you're tempted to be ungraceful towards something when you had that moment when you are tempted to bring your pass back into your present let it affect your future
2479.5,2490.78, i want to do for you today is to remind you that bagged symbolizes that by that little tag doesn't have to be the way that you operate the distinctive reality
2491.89,2504.76, the gospel is a grace that covers everything and jesus has bought that for you an what here's what i want to either should be a penance that and i'd like for you to write on that just simply the word grace
2508.3,2533.71, right the word drake and here's what i want you to do i want you to be able to put that somewhere because you're going to fall into the trap of thinking fairness you're going to fall into the trap of thinking i have to prove it you're going to fall into the trap and thinking i'm not good enough and what i want you to say is it doesn't have to be that way i want you to look at that little agayentha is not the distinguishing factor of jesus and should not be the distinguishing factor in my life
2537.13,2538.72, it may be to day
2539.35,2541.12, on the other side
2541.54,2544.9, under the things that you want that grace to cover
2546.19,2551.89, everything in your past maybe relationships in your past may be things that you just think 
2552.25,2554.32, that's just my issue
2557.35,2565.3, feel uncomfortable put in that and a public place and having in that flipped over side having stuffed it's that personal you don't have to ride it
2566.56,2567.97, courage you
2569.5,2571.75, allow that thing
2572.83,2576.13, when you see that remember if he's as
2576.79,2578.29, the woman
2578.68,2581.95, not condemned that had been caught in adultery
2582.28,2586.75, standing there with very any clothes on just reeking of that moment
2588.55,2589.69, she
2589.93,2591.7, and with all your junk
2592.54,2593.92, all your baggage
2597.01,2598.45, let us be people
2598.99,2600.64, marinated
2600.64,2602.17, the great the gospel
2602.74,2603.91, force
2607.57,2609.85, to understand grace
2610.96,2617.86, help us to understand this crucial aspect of what it means to live in following you
2619.57,2624.88, let us not be people that just have this veneer of the gospel
2624.94,2626.5, not the truth of it
2626.98,2662.65, going in our hearts god idiots who have not dealt gracefully with himself afraid that she would help them to see themselves to the lines of your grace lord the toad bring places that we have not let grace completely got into the core that the noon craggy's of our heart i pray that she would just play tatras in their lord that you would help us to understand that in a way that just blows our mind or an outlet to walk and the relentless understanding of how gracefully retreated us
