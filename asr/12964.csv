25.95,28.83, in the exhibition with a performance
29.1,36.24, i'm drawing life each line one breath investigating an outwork and the drawing itself
36.24,39.12, most basic components of facts
40.68,43.44, breathing the line so
43.5,48.33, and drawing one line and breathing out and enduring this again and again
49.62,58.32, one line takes me approximately fifty to twenty seconds ten any meters of a drone at approximately one hour to draw
62.76,66.66, more about release facts and principles of creating something
66.75,75.48, just focusing and concentrating on de space in between the lines and the drawing the line and drawing the nothingness of the line this
76.53,79.41, to a point in my thinking
79.5,81.87, feeling perceiving myself
82.32,83.4, not
84.0,86.58, destiny more there is no
86.67,91.68, difference between ride or wrong or being or not being
93.42,98.91, if the lines are very straight and there are not a lot of pedestrians in the drawing
