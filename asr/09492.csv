5.46,7.8, as matters
14.55,18.54, celebrations
18.6,20.13, hesitation
24.57,27.39, things that i think that
28.83,30.54, i am a man
30.75,31.89, as an
31.89,34.17, but is that any
36.99,41.73, certainly the argument and certainly the argument that
43.14,45.87, i don't have the right experience
47.91,51.84, seem to train on these views of the beauties
52.11,53.43, but experience
53.97,60.72, therefore does into play into his palms around race but as i think is so monotonous
61.56,65.28, the veterans should not be allowed
66.12,70.74, matically how to do with this view but experience
71.01,73.47, i think that sometimes it does
73.5,75.72, sometimes he boldly does
75.87,81.9, very often a cover for the few the chance of his idle arm really
82.35,83.49, oh
84.09,87.03, reinhart
88.68,94.29, hasparren the that invasion lying in
95.28,96.27, then
96.36,98.85, fundamentally operating
100.29,102.66, the exclusion in
102.84,105.3, deformed
105.99,108.21, nino the natural attitude
113.43,115.44, no want to make
116.91,119.58, and it's worth that i have
119.85,121.68, i like
123.72,127.71, we soon a chance feminism
127.86,132.03, in particular i like the idea of a chance to nestwood
132.48,137.25, sentinels of multiple oppressions and take off the seriously
139.44,141.51, i do worry about
141.72,143.88, a particular problem
144.3,148.02, and isobel
151.35,158.58, i anathemas important thing that comes out in current judge and momentary
158.64,161.94, he edoocation of women
162.54,167.49, you also passionate people
170.58,174.12, i think that there can be an additional dimension
193.98,194.85, now
197.28,199.17, worrying about his
200.16,201.18, how
201.24,206.07, you take sessional intersectional model
207.78,213.0, that made interaction between gender was cast
213.24,216.42, aristides
216.75,219.72, you love the multiple dimensioned
220.14,222.12, secessionists
222.54,225.51, the monometallist interruptions
228.12,231.12, intersections of what gender in gender
233.43,236.13, how do you think about the interconnected
239.19,240.03, to
240.24,243.42, to napoleon and criticize
245.01,249.18, i think it's kind of an underlying presupposition of the chatterer
250.56,253.11, i think that the change in her paradise
253.74,257.97, trans people problematically with respect to the finer
258.84,264.93, between treason
266.37,271.26, earlier i think in the course that promotes it doesn't respect
271.65,274.65, necessarily a trans personal identification
275.04,284.94, present says i don't see myself as in between aniela i see myself as a real woman i see myself as a real man
286.62,288.87, he is in the window
289.95,296.22, position then as an outsider automatically situated with the carpenter
296.7,297.9, to
297.99,299.97, just regard to self identity
302.22,305.01, the fall prey in my boat to a form of
306.9,309.42, which is
310.11,314.52, as people are balloonette with the garden binary
316.56,320.46, you make sense of the interaction between
320.58,323.82, passion and presentable
324.18,325.71, over
327.72,332.85, recruits of the lingering eternity of the fine harry
332.88,335.64, never have place which is in consonance
337.35,342.63, never have deranged while in which a person is both of pressed
342.87,345.69, the woman and pressed
348.15,349.35, a person
351.87,353.01, but
356.07,358.83, so i worry about added
358.89,362.61, beyond the binary mode
363.33,364.23, so
365.16,367.53, might be the tolerator
367.65,368.94, so
369.12,375.63, how many possible to really do indicates which we have intersections
376.05,377.61, there
382.89,386.19, that's a stop now and
