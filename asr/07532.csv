110.61,112.05, indescribable
112.89,122.4, all made a point of writing down what i exactly fielding this process because its especial feeling a hole all of you will feel it a whole healed had failed
122.82,124.92, this how i feel about this event here
125.52,128.01, when i started many years ago
129.51,132.96, from education where
133.17,137.55, my examination was to name soft boil legs in several languages
137.67,138.78, i did
139.5,144.78, he was in messenian so the censor had no idea of that so i passed
147.21,151.5, i was training classic techniques to the holland as
151.65,154.02, i wish the butter

172.86,184.77, somewhere that is gratis the glass embroiled by gad we are having less embury and muscular festival right now i didn't mean it mean that literally actually amused
185.64,191.61, then came up here way alone now take me take me and one written in the cheffonier taught in
191.76,193.62, he paced
193.62,197.46, these new modern sinues that arose especially from spain
198.36,200.61, then i opened my restaurant noma
202.62,204.45, that process i was
204.81,205.92, thinking
207.0,210.0, what is a authentic cuisine
210.3,212.73, how do you make a cousin
213.21,216.75, like the long at a specific point
218.34,219.99, i realized that
220.44,222.18, the insolent
223.59,226.83, the reciting of soft for legendre languages
227.16,228.84, not enough
229.14,231.15, simply something missing
231.96,237.45, in order for us to somehow grasp or region of food
238.2,241.38, we need to understand our culture the people we are
242.85,244.65, ancient food history
245.13,248.49, how we become the people we are to day
249.39,253.53, a whole new range of questions started occurring to me
254.46,257.07, and i stared reading books that i've never read before
257.94,258.99, about
260.79,264.3, about the hunters
264.33,268.5, about the agrarian period i read about agriculture
268.95,270.87, a doubt people
271.11,278.04, the past decade and astonishing ninety per cent of a crop variety has disappeared
279.51,282.33, this is an attack on industry people
282.54,283.8, how is it
285.09,288.09, we want many ingredients cook with
288.18,293.79, we want that we have different ingredients throughout the world or do we want to we all took the same things
294.12,296.61, because it's going in the wrong direction
297.75,301.08, cooking the same food that 
301.5,303.39, made for the same sea
304.08,305.4, a problem
305.85,310.41, to say actions we the chips and the farmers
311.52,318.12, never before a professional chef had any relationship with farmers never
318.39,319.74, until now
319.77,323.1, there i started searching out for these people
323.73,325.68, difficult in the beginning
326.04,327.3, we managed
327.66,337.08, several he found one of them has been a huge inspiration in spite each other tremendously he's a close friend of a architect other
337.11,339.33, just beyond what
340.98,346.86, we started with him he had a large part of his field as manicure
348.24,352.44, supermarkets he saved only a small part of it for himself
353.43,357.18, himself in touch with the soil and his trade
358.11,366.27, i was at that point starting to read about the riots all ancient verities we were in contact with noreen banks and new seeds
366.42,370.02, the discussion a debate about how
370.08,370.98, this
372.03,376.26, with time he now has a undecent polyctor
377.31,380.19, an astonishing range of ingredients
380.55,382.95, with him a presence better
383.16,388.26, him you the guest had been of food we had more intent to put
388.26,389.4, the plate
389.67,391.41, make more dishes
392.34,397.35, i had two types of captious from now sometimes he has twelve
397.77,399.03, the name of 
399.48,407.16, i'm saying this because i believe that these small interactions even though their quite small and they might may be right
407.19,410.04, private in a way is very very important
411.0,413.34, very important not only for the inspiration
413.37,415.98, a small way
416.82,418.05, all
418.98,421.5, they can actually create real change
422.37,427.23, this legitimist i think that if we are together if a creaturely
427.56,432.57, people that i might fall about what we do together i'm not saying that we should
433.38,441.15, the same thing you'll have the same philosophy around the food all of us you was wilder and put wildflowers on to raw fish
441.6,450.51, say we need to know more about the food that we eat the planet will even and we need to create better relationship with all the people that out there
450.87,452.88, very very very important
453.27,457.44, today three hundred actually wrote a list of all the people at her
457.44,468.69, snowy america england ireland france spain germany rumania turkey stranjan china switzerland south africa peru have i forgotten anybody
469.47,474.33, but as all makes it go scot land
474.51,476.4, near the land
476.82,479.19, we hear from all
479.46,480.87, the world
481.29,484.56, imagining this in our part of the world
485.01,487.5, five years ago would be impossible
488.19,489.66, just impossible
489.75,492.51, i seen a lot of your sweet
492.57,499.29, all of them as people are coming here and now people are saying i can't believe i'm putting myself on a plan to go to denmark
499.38,500.43, food
502.56,508.08, i believe it either you know i can't believe that you all came here to remember
508.5,509.7, remember
509.76,521.04, we grew up believing that food is not good enough everything south of the border is better we grew up believing that the variety we have of ingredients is not big enough to bassing around
521.64,526.65, what we discovered is that we have a huge amazing variety of products
526.92,537.18, we have a culture we have brains we have people if there is a message from this place opening and all the pillingshot as out there right now is that food can happen anywhere
537.48,539.88, food can happen anywhere
540.15,547.44, so nobody believed that years ago we didn't believe it i didn't believe it i never thought it would come to this place here
547.86,551.31, it has been a journey that is unbelievable
553.56,556.38, this opiate as i told you
557.07,559.23, gatesboro years
559.68,566.91, finding money here and there scraping a bit here a bit there so please excuse us if the toil it gets overcrowded
566.97,572.73, then stop breaking its nature you are very welcome to use it
572.91,576.63, excuses for these things we know we're not going to be perfectly one
577.65,579.39, feel that we must try
579.69,582.84, we have to try and this is the spirit of this place
582.96,587.67, new thoughts and believing that everything is possible because it is
587.79,598.17, and at least if it isn't we should try and that's why we here say you thank you very much
