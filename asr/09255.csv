16.38,30.27, really didn't want to come but i didn't sell i had anything to say so i have a problem but when he asked this question is just an stotting about
30.3,41.73, probably to many problems i have to change culture from time of eating you know to survive and to enjoy food

104.7,111.81, writing a book fairport and 
112.68,119.76, he was riding a chapeau to and the other poor
119.79,132.9, you take the water rible to read because they were almost eating nothing it was only fish i met and grain so it was severiano that indifferent way but there was not
132.99,135.81, the which they also
135.81,137.43, all the things
138.6,162.12, as he arrived in the start of this chapter of the countries location are praised for the great wealth several metals minerals precious stones perinean but all this scot and nature has denied differs and then that some way true but there some good things but
162.15,166.29, i will come to her as i will speak
167.46,183.84, and the circumstance helped abe very poor though the time you know everything has been beneficence wailing fishing and catching birds and eggs
184.08,190.5, can derive patentees patala
190.8,198.63, it was probably the only thing we had to export at that time four hundred to two hundred years ago
201.3,204.63, fish is our main export
204.99,211.59, and the nearly all family he has a boat a little boat like that my father has that both
212.25,226.23, and we eat everything on the fish liver hat and teething and we we have fresh fish and then we have also what you call from interfuse in each fish

263.97,271.26, day seeing something he had been catching for fishing and
271.29,290.79, if we should be fine it was properly danish met blooming like that for that was no finery thing is put in one thought if you have met laverette everything in the same path and it was not a matter of enjoying you as a matter of saving
292.62,297.0, you see the appetite then we come back to this question in
299.79,307.23, two words appetite and ambition are a little similar as if you think about appetite is something you smell
307.83,312.36, you are seeing something or
313.2,320.04, now get eager to get this and it's the same with the ambition teredo something
320.46,325.29, so my appetite has been the ambition to change things
325.44,330.18, then things from whatever to something else
330.75,335.4, a very proud of my old car called sir but

364.38,366.57, not allowed to survive
367.02,373.08, people told me you want to let the stupid so it has been a hard work to come to where we are today
373.8,385.98, not so many chiefs who are talking about food and parlando tly they are just working and doing the papeterie doing them so
389.01,397.74, very alone sometimes but it's very good to come to things like this because you got the courage again to do something
403.14,408.57, give me up the tide to see that things are shaping up and people think at that
408.6,415.53, not so stupid but we are doing some are angry because we are changed in the old culture but it's okay

489.48,492.75, can we help potatoes
493.83,520.95, a green house is we are tried to make strawberry last year in it was fantastic probably the best i ever had tasted and the reason is probably because the sun is the limited factor in the growth in friend and a head in the yard so it stronger slowly that it's sucking everything up from the air or from the heart and getting his fantastic taste
521.1,527.67, while plantation i was trying to work with because a good moon seemed and things like that so
527.73,535.47, and the cockatoo was too of the major
536.34,543.63, and far islands to survive because they were in a wide table were only those two which can seem
