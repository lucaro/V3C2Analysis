0.69,27.21, alfilleria antonio i want to think of the cochranites who have accommodated me so i could spend a lastingly kids so thank you for that and i'm delighted to be electorate can wear a jombateeste neurologist watering his study
27.39,42.39, iloilo deronda than offer everybody save your lineata about that what i'm going to talk about instead was a very technical study that i did a number of years ago that wound of getting published in this
42.39,104.76, famous biology journal called new yorker and parapeted by was ergo a secretary that i had this was a guy he distributed stafford near before he was working a couple of years before going off to english literature braschon and the problem with him was realized one day he was just irritating the heat of india it had nothing to do with jowering there would have had to do was his music tastes okay you know what comes next which is my complaining about his listening to his twenty or old music which could be scientifically proved to be inferior to mine that wasn't the problem the problem was one day he would be listening to whatever horrendous music there was a sage grouse and the next days listening to baton and the day after that lessingham said grant arachnaeus his kids just wildly
104.82,108.87, tintypes of music he was getting his first page has
108.9,189.84, i was using them to just explore music and he was having a great time then one monday morning he had long hair in a burdon monday morning comes in and he shaved everything off his bear adansis head and once that about and assist ithout it would be interesting to see if people would interact with me differently if i look so different then darting cairene day something ran realist or monday asked what he did over the week end he's been to some intempestiva and seen fourteen of these in a road just vishner done before this kid was like pathologically open to new experiences flashlike this one biting about where i was i listened to music all the time i realized it in decades since i listened to a new composer and i haven't changed my peradeniya is president and i suddenly religionists people where a latent they sell you and ologies of nineteen seventy musicales is like this one tapottes greatest historians and economists might promoting free of
189.84,199.26, respectful considering your primary priorities are gone but being assigned this for your own to do is sublimated into an experiment
199.32,285.78, so i decided to do a study side had belonged in my lab code and my microscope all fired up i started making fun calls and when i wanted to do initially was tried to explore this notion of why we closed in novelty as we got older and being pumped in by my secretary in the next room was now listening to fallon the olesome thing that decides explore this interims tastes so i called up fifteen music stations across the united states some contemporary rocks and old essington ask him two questions first what the average age of the music you play and second what's the average age of the people who listen to your music into a whole bunch of fancies statistics and back comes a fine that there is not a whole lot of people listening to rage against the machine and nursing homes or on the antsisters in high school or the people who listened to james tangling to wear a chestertonian music distinction ostentatiously penchant
285.87,355.68, some sort of window closes okay so far up that i decided to try another version of this looking at food expend a novel for tents and these becomes a course more counts novel food you know as armoricans apple pie by now what sort of actions there and eventually i settle on such such in the american mid west of the assumption that italiaenische
355.77,372.24, argument between the two cushions that are panthers but amos found out fortissimo of statistics was this finding in this case by age thirty five if you were not voluntarily eating society five per cent chance that you never going to
372.24,378.54, okay so with that part i decided to try to serapion and i decide to look at fashion
378.81,466.47, now i want to have isometric so virtually on an hourly basis i can see how many generations were the fashion in that of touch with it but i got sort of exploring the intrigue out what's going to be the thing to go after tattoo tattoos on dunmore tauben there all this changes the reasons for it ernestine ornate were here and what opinion stridency that becomes what i suddenly discovered as i had entered the world of tugenden rings so that point i think my secretary stationariness
466.5,474.39, so we've got this aged twenty one per fashion thirty one for music thirty five for food taste and what is this about
474.48,514.02, i next discovered was i very arduously reinvented the well and that this also to people makiling study in the enclosure to novelty the closure in the novelty that we generate elusively that we want experience there's these psychological personality profiles you can take and one of the component is open as to atrabiliar filled with people i know and you do the studies and you got the exact curve of being less interested in all to you he can order the exact same courage if you're looking at somebody in prior fishing village an icelander in south korea very very consistent cross culture
514.32,579.06, the psychologist looking at it there's a guy here day this nineteen simon on whose documented amongst immensely creative people how their creative output on the average to weston with age and quantifiable a number of lines of santander of measures of composing going down with age but which even more interesting was his finding completely consonant with orders talking about is that these highly highly creative years become less open to somebody else is novelty as they get older and this is the whole world of einstein spending his last decades to this rearguard action against continental of the most accomplished semitenth century and the old thing the guys everybody be known for as he was the last credible sinton earth he didn't believe in dawnings extremely disinterested in his later years in anything new he came along
579.39,595.2, so the question becomes why does this happen why is it that we get older and what these studies show is interesting altogether adults only adolescence peaks on an endocrine their after why is it that this happens to us
595.2,615.15, okay so i'm a neurologist of course when i first think about usual suspects is the aging brain and what's going on there and you can immediately come up with all sorts of speculations we have a novelty part of the brain and clearly something dreadful happens to manomet part of the brain while get older and that simply doesn't work
615.39,622.08, for a bunch of reasons of a prancing about what everybody used to know from day one was
622.11,654.21, something horrendous happens to our brains as we got older you're eighteen you brain is great you're in absence attesting their electro physiology and all that and on the very morning of her twenty first birthday something happened to something happened and you starting turns and this is norman inevitable brain aging in canopy the time you're forty your neck and neck with a bride shrimpington loss is not a future bringing
654.39,718.08, so there's no mass of your one lost on her novelty sumter and in fact there is no novelty center in the brain let alone subsections based on such interests so that doesn't work and he turns out the adult brain incredibly plastic and resilient and fallible one of the things they would teach you in intumescence like an the first day the last five thousand years is the adult brain doesn't make new nurseling in the field in the last decade turns out the adult brain does in some very interesting part of the brain and a response to new experience novelty stimulation we make no transient old age we make new connections in response to experience the brain is not setstone and in so far as if not so estonishment away on us you get older so the geology woolloomooloo what the psychologists have to say about this 
718.14,788.73, and it turns out they've got all sorts of interesting things back to that utensil and he has a very interesting finding again looking at these highly highly creative people and have your creative out good in their openness the novelty goes to one goes down over time and what he discovered with something critical which is the main predictor of is not our age is europe in your discipline it's your discipline or age in other words people who amicae pick up and change disciplines set the clock back on their openness and novelty and missus a pretty interesting finding of horses confounded by this issue which shoes to pick up and mid career go and change but this is a very consistent finding what's also not clear is if you truly take on new sorts of tancredi transformation creativity bitterer or do you merely go to in the old thing and you setting its amazing you know what use to partisanship
788.94,792.96, found something in addition which was even more important
793.05,846.84, which was again he's looking at these highly creative highly accomplished people and what he finds it is as a predictor of which it enclosed in novelty somebody else is novelty during einheriar is if you wind up suffering from the very very very dread state of being eminent in your field because if your eminent that a huge predecease an obey what's that about your very eminent your august or silver back in the great ursinus and anything new comes along once in coeducation you in your bodies and the textbooks no wonder you start rearguard action against novelty so is this whole finding there that it's not so much your age it's how long you've been in perdition and the more investment you have in nothing changing and that discipline because you are part of the bed rock 
847.17,908.25, turns out another psychologist had a lot to say about this and this psychologist named tuarick hair as suit to ten years ago came up with a rectorial coffee table book called the print was sumptuous in mercer subject which rented apart the developmental psychology literature about how important to me easiest stedingers an put in a mode for that later as were both driftest about it but one of the things she emphasized in there was the power of pierrots the power of pure socialization and the way she would think about this phenomenon closing to novelty during the age is orating in adolescent and what is the cultural imperative you have above everything else to demonstrate to the world that you have nothing whatsoever to do with anybody who ever came before eventime especially your parents and you just wait until whatever cultural outrages invented by some malcontent of your generation and you all grave on to it and it defines your peer group
909.42,930.09, so now he come back to one thirty forty years later and is younger grew and the same generation identification is going on and you sit there and you say why should i listen to this new music stuff i listened to one we were to feeding hitler or liking ingersley with each other woodstock or whatever it is it was fine and i still could now
930.15,936.42, find yourself twiddling the dial on the radio station in the car trying to find something that's none
936.54,958.11, okay so all of this gives us some insight or biology doesn't give us much insight psychology disciplinary age adonis investment of the status quo identification with your generation peer group all of this is great but is a biologist this widely decadent be for a very simple reason
958.11,981.57, look at a rat and you look at what point in life is willing to try a new time and it's the exact same curve you take a baby rat and is no more interesting new food in our three year olds are in trying to vegetables somewhere about adolescence ardent in the willingness to eat no food was way up straight down after that it's the exact same curve
981.6,1004.1, and there is no rat sitting there over identifying with its tenure position of a member taisch thing whatever's going on here is deep pletely imbedded duchesses far more than ourselves is this is a pattern musulman primate rovers all of that would ever it is it is highly highly biological
1004.4,1036.56, so what can that be but on that point i start poking around to see what the anthropologist have to say about it and you see very interesting there are some advantages to meeting this way there are some advantages to holding on to what you had and not falling for the new great example of this is was a study published in nature some urago looking at elephant herds and east africa and what the research was shown was the older the oldest patriarch is in the group
1036.59,1039.05, better the infant survival
1039.32,1068.54, and this was after controlling for whether missus graham was the oldest mantri art unrelated the older the old patriarch is the better the infant arrival once that about that memory that once every fifty years some disaster is draining and you better help their a sixty year old patriarch who remembers how many fields over in valleys in that direction do you need to go to find out one swamp that still going to be there you need that sort of history
1068.66,1142.25, you need somebody holding on to it jarniman has made the same point when thinking about promotions versus the underthoughts neanderthals as far as we can tell a forty year life expectancy romanist or in expectancy critical imitation of that which is some rare disastrous but then comes along and the clanahan a fifty per cent better channels of having somebody still around who remembered how to get out of that mess the last time it happened he had the only way back and incur is if you have your old hanging on to what they know instead of jesting at for whatever the years had lines so captain views here is one a group identification eminence all of that anthropological precedent with her may be some advantages shared tax anomaly with her speeches so what you supposed to say as a sinister this point is more research is needed on the subject sunderiand it was around this point that it struck me may be all of this has been so puzzling to me because i was asking the wrong question throughout maybe the key issue is not why is it that as we get older less interesting novelty
1142.25,1148.25, the question is why is it that as we get older we want the family so much more often
1148.43,1177.5, and this comes from wonderful book i an often anthracite number great books one of his books were in seven undersides ern costitus and it's just to live a study sociological study of the people and there and one person focuses on a lot this was this either old guy and he and his room mate had been together for three four years in there and this guy memory was not the greatest any more his roommate and he told the same stories now the
1177.53,1183.23, so i santered in the sky and he was saying to her one or those stories as great
1183.29,1194.66, here to story ten times in a day makes me completely crazy to hear joe story ten times a day for the last three years is one most comforting things i can rely on 
1195.2,1239.72, another version of this the egertons was on his death bed apparently this was the hospital of virgil and his wife was sitting there for days and was clear he was going to go and she was there around the clock and he had his heavy ring and every now and then he would bang it on the railing of the hospital bed and finally she consented with him she shared her husband's death and she gets irritated with him and said will you stop to mattered you know i'm still here and he says i just want to make sure of still here and lots of ways again not while dislike novelty why do we hold on to the familiar because all it happens over time it is the footing underneath us gismondo quisante want to make sure were still there and a familiar form
1240.11,1277.73, so ultimately i think this gives us a lot of insight but back to that issue it raised to minutes ago or research isn't idolatry need more research on the subject is it such a crime that i listened to bovary all the times one of our society disasters that we don't have a whole lot of eidiol with tongue stood eating raw yield at this essendean i think it is and one of the ways this is noontime is because of what i do for a living which is to spend my time around highly agitated smart creative twenty year old to the university and there something he noticed there
1277.76,1309.23, i see among my best ones and these were not the ones with the best cheap has but the one who are on fire with something on fire about somebody else the usual once who were going literally across the track to reined in the barometer the ones protesting whenever the for the ones who after graduation epick up and treat lepers and congo and such these are the ones where i sat there and i look at them i always have the same to pressing thought which is used to be so much easier to be like that
1309.71,1332.84, and ultimately i think the biggest reason why we have to fight this tendency to close to novelty not just the advantages we will get from it it is not just twenty year olds who should be burning with the excitement something to but all i think the most important reason looking at these kids heading off to the congo is an open mind is a prerequisite to open heart
1332.93,1353.18, and if we can hold on longer and longer in life to seeing the similarities rather than differences and embrace vesicatories or i suspect so on that note will need to lead shortly to get my tongue stone but a word
