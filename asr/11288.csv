0.06,179.94, no matter where you live grilling is fun it's fun to put some meat on the old rill invite some friends over friends of like mind have some good conversation and have some good growth stake in this case this is grilling made simple microvideo that amusing the regular drill chances are you have on your back yard been sitting there waiting to be used and noticed that i placed the charcoal to one side of the road not in the center a lot of the charcoal now come with startled already on them does matter if you add your own for had an added start the flames they sure that you start a fluid is even and all of the choral of course one that's going good then you may go ahead and let her rip and let her do her thing the charcoal baritone in the meantime you want to prepare your stake now take note this is parashino state for brilliant i wanted to prove a point i wanted to simply grow cheaper thing i could find to show how simple is and i mean simple like i said this takes not for willing but i'm using it any way to illustrate my point i put some soosanside i then had salt and pepper on each side and again here this is all personalized stuff you will be adding what you like to your state but take note that i did not add barbecues to said hoste flame is ready the charcoal is ready i should have said the flame is gone and the charcoal is ready and then placed the growl a top of the charcoal because i wanted to kill all the germs that of accumulated during the winter well that's my excuse this matter had chariot ready for the stake he kept your stake in your place it on the charcoal here this is one of the areas where i think your personal imputation if for example you like your state to be good and brown then that's what you do leave it on longer if you don't then don't leave it on as long i think between five and ten minutes on each side is perfect that's my own personally between five and ten minutes and i side and that's great because now you have your grimace if you had hierarchies on your charcoal that flavour will go up into the state to see what i'm talking about
179.97,189.63, you're done with that of course your ready a good speaking to look good as it
189.75,260.22, a right yet those grilled marks on the stake a well the not ready yet but it looks good in my case i just poured a little so as souwester back on to the stake why not write after each side has been seared about five to ten minutes on each side then you may either put it on a luminant your choice because now the cooking process will begin here you notice that the state is away from the flame not on the flank it away from the flame now you know the reason for putting that on one side and one otterway from the flame then all i need to do now is put the lid on remember that the heat and the barbecues watching a cook your state and there it is checkmate it put it in a long it stays in of course is a matter of personal taste
260.25,347.7, my state was cooking i visited with my birds on the wall his or my buddies anyway let summarizing need to do is set your grill at your charcoal to your grill placed it in the charcoal place charcoal rather to one side of the ground maintainer you want to get the fit your charcoal going once the flames disappear and the charcoal is white all over white hot and that's when it's ready to put your stake once you put to take over the charcoal but you want to do as you want to see your stakes five to ten minutes on each side and then once that finish of course he read it to put your lid on your charcoal grill and then cook it for as long or at the end of that time i went or i been hour and a half depending on your taste how you like your state this is when you had your barbecue sauce and the reason for that is because most barbecue saw have sugar in it and sugar will burn when you had to barbecue sauce you're simply added to both sides your own special brand the barbecue stateside but the lid back on for another thirty five
347.97,392.64, to an hour depending on your taste at the end this is what you have here though it was not billingsgate into chuck rose to whatever they call it this is what i ended up with and it was good
