0.51,95.61, and it is exciting be with you guys here this morning to day as we begin to get into this stuff is cursed i'm a superexcited about where we're landing today i superexcited about this as we kind of come to the conclusion of this series and we're going to dive into it before i get into it i want to say to university of a bandstand of course excited about that were headed and what we're doing in this kind of toothache to get into the senorita electuaries occasioned throughout his entertainer or people who live in or some of you you are believers in jesus your believers in god and yet at the same time we are not immune to the reality of doubt we are not immune to these moments in our lives were we ask the question is it true
96.3,97.83, it be
98.25,117.12, is this really about what i think it's about and will begin to kind of look in and peer into this and we begin to have these moments that we kind of get to this conclusion we say if this is true then the meaning of this is incredibly significant in my life but i have to know is it true
117.42,119.58, a moment where we doubt
119.85,129.75, the story is so significant this reality is so significant that when we begin to see what are the implications of this sometimes its overwhelming to us
130.47,138.78, and i know if you've been in those places i don't know if you've kind of come to this place where you've asked that question is this really true
139.11,146.43, is this really something that i can stake my life on it is something that i can trust in
147.0,195.99, because if so this requires something of my life i see college i went through a town and with the kind of a season where i began to listen to the someone voices around around me an academia and as a psychology major i begin to question some of the things that he was experiencing in worship and questioning whether or not this was true or whether this is just something i needed to believe in fulsome sort of a need that i had in my heart and i began to go into this period of doubt and i begin to dandilieth this process through this seems like this is outside of what is normative at this is outside of what scientific theory would explain
196.65,225.69, and as i began to get into this as i begin to understand there was something that began to radically transform my life and there is a story that began to orient my life and completely change and in this period of doubt in this period of china figure out god are you really there is this something that i can rely on as this something that is just kind of a nice story as is something that's just gives hope to hopeless people or is this something that i can set the trajectory of my life and then i can rely on
225.72,227.49, in the midst of that
227.94,239.04, i began to doubt who god is and i begin to understand that as this what i was really doubting as i was doubting
239.04,241.68, god's real love for me
241.68,244.17, true acceptance of me
244.23,258.03, i began to say i don't really know if you really love me if you really accept me and as i began to process that and say why is that so significant why is it that i am casting a suspicious eye towards god
259.32,262.89, and i begin to peer into scripture
263.49,276.69, now if you're like me i don't know if you like that but i begin to realize that this reality of who i was and the questions that i was asking even in the questions that was asking begin to reveal who god was
276.9,283.68, because i was living a life that was really by all outside circumstances a pretty good life
283.71,312.39, i was as a college student highly actualized i was successful objectively i came from a family that loved me all these things would point to the fact that in all the great things that were going on in my life that whole that was still there that thing that was still there was singing
313.05,315.03, something beyond me
315.48,317.61, o god
318.0,327.72, and this began to put me back into this exploration of who god was and began to ask a question god is this really true do you love me
327.81,338.4, do you accept me and i need to understand this god i don't want to play all these games but i need to understand is this true
338.85,414.72, i begin to realize something and begin to realize that there is a gap between what i understood that the bible was saying and what that really meant and one of the moments that really clarified this for me was a moment that i felt like i fell in love and so i don't know if you've ever been in that place before where you are just like headforemost rethought honorary like you but there is this moment that all the sudden einleitung that moment here is what happened i understood unlamenting about what these people were saying at one point i understood the lyricists happening inside of me it means something else like i get it now i finally understand country music right or earneth lovesongs but typically countrymen this there is this moment where i was like this is what this is saying and all of a sudden this is connected 
415.41,421.8, when i begin to understand was that most of my life i had heard the words
421.8,424.29, loves you and accept your
425.28,429.15, some point i really did understand what that meant for me
430.56,432.84, and when i understood what that meant
432.9,435.39, begin to radically change my life
435.51,440.01, he testily changed my life like the way i was
440.22,453.54, not the way i am and there is a part of the bible that began to express this and explain this to me more than anything else and as we conclude this series i want to show you this moment
453.6,456.63, have incredible love
457.44,478.41, i heard all these stories about how jesus died on the cross for me and how jesus suffered for me and i'd seen that the depiction of a bloody naked cheese of right and this is something that i could get in my mind but still not truly connect too and it was something that still was distant
478.41,485.91, but then i began to explore scripture and then something began to break open into my eyes and i begin to realize a moment
486.6,493.68, maybe all of the moments were the love of god was expressed in a significant way
494.01,503.1, and i want to let the bible speak to ask cause maybe you're like me maybe you are here to day that there's a point that you say i don't know
503.4,519.0, if i can really trust the love of god and the acceptance of who god is my i don't really know if i if i could just abandon everything else and allow the love of god to fulfill me without any other additives in my life
519.81,550.26, this here's the fight that we are a people who believe and doubt oftentimes were like i think that you are significant enough but i also want to hedge my bets and throw i want to be able to bring into this the way that other people believe about me boy friend a girl friend or my success in this all these things to make sure that just in case your love isn't enough that have all the rest of the stuff to be able to say oh
552.12,605.52, you don't know that what happens when we begin to find our love and worth in something other than an then god what happens as we begin to ride this portus we began to ride this kind of wave up and down because we believe sometimes that were really close to god and other times were really distant from god and an if that is you if sometimes you feel near to god sometimes you feel distant to god there might be something that you're missing and that's something that you're missing might be the overwhelming clarity of the love of god in the acceptance of god in your life because once you get that once that is connected to you and a soul level the ups and downs of christian life the single ray elects me what i'm doing good and then i kind of run away and said
606.84,610.98, reality is found in the story of the bible
611.52,630.72, in that story of the bible for us is this reality that that is painted across the entire swath in the first thing we begin to see in act one is that god creates humanity and when he creates humanity of the very beginning an act one he is walking with him he is dialogist him in the garden
630.78,654.63, they had no sin god is holy there is this tiresome of beauty and for them they have no shame right as they walk naked in the garden and they have no shame in it a picture for us a being absolutely incredibly excepting of hugues and knowing that he is incredibly accepting of who we are there's nothing between
654.66,656.64, god and people
657.27,747.45, but what happens in act two is that people decide that they don't trust god the seed of distress is son into humanity by satan and in this moment they begin to think i don't know if god really loves me or accepts me what happens there they begin to go their own way and that's called sin and when we decide to say i'm going to find my love and acceptance in something other than god i'm going to i'm going to go in that way and not in god's ways that is the beginning of sentiment in all of us is there what happens in that moment theatreland goddistead isrealites when we begin to unsaturated not with us a well separated from us in this temple so everyone would say that's where god dwells and they would relate to god in a fearful way in fearful obedience god is powerful he is separated from us we think we should do this but what happens is all throughout humanity that idea of god as a distant god that we obey out of fear never brings us into a sense of security with our heavenly father and we go through the stockland down when we do it well we feel connected because right were doing exactly because it's clear we are accepted when we do things right and were not accepted on we do things wrong and slew giac and forth in this
748.71,777.09, but the beauties there's an act three and the act three is what we're going to be talking about to day because the act three is this reality that god said you know what there is a commonwealth together then you sin and there is a distance from us but i'm not going to allow that to stay and so in the right place and the right time when god orchestrated the events of the world in order to allow a moment to happen god sent his
777.15,779.01, very own son
779.16,780.63, into this world
781.5,784.32, he sent jesus
784.5,791.61, in christmas time we talk about this and the story that they would tell over and over is this reality
791.88,796.41, of god deciding to send his son into this world
796.68,806.76, so in act three there's this reality that they got as with us and it looks like this it looks like this angel coming to this teenage girl and saying hey you've got to have a baby
807.45,839.13, she's saying you know what i don't think so because of never had sex with anybody and that's kind of how it works right and no you don't understand you're going to have a baby and here's how it's going to work the holy spirit's going to overshadow you and is this reality is that you're going to become impregnated with a child in this and so she's overwhelmed that she is his chosen person that is going to carry the child of god and at the same time she is betrothed to she's kind of engaged to a game chosen
839.76,872.46, i know that this is not going to go well when joseph finds out your pregnant and it's god's child i don't know what's going on here and so i just you know clarity there's an angel that sent to joseph and says a actually she's telling true right this wasn't just some bathing that she's saying to you this is actually happening and orthoceratites 
872.73,875.31, jesus is earthly father
875.79,881.4, and he says all this then and here's how this concludes with this moment
881.55,886.47, scripture where we see in matthew one verse twenty two
886.62,904.77, all of this is put together and it basically says this in verse on is all of this took place to fulfil with the lord had said to the prophet the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and they will call him a manual
904.95,909.06, which means god with us now
909.51,913.05, in christmas time we hear this story
913.32,922.02, and we kind of i think gloss over it with all of the things that occupy the space and christmas time
922.41,926.4, but this story is of god
926.52,936.81, who takes and since his son to earth and impregnates a young the girl in order to bear
936.96,952.53, the saviour of the world and all of this as it was foretold this is a whole the whole plan of god saying you know what this is not just something that happened on i got on board with it this was the plan that at the right moment and the right time
953.34,997.92, i would interject this into humanity into history and what happens is we begin to have a new reality act three is god with us at one god dwells with us at two gods distant from us at three is god with us and this is incredible in this is amazing and i think if you damtouchy understand some stuff that the idea of god with us when we begin to see what god did in this that you need to get a context we need to get a picture for how loving this was
998.85,1007.19, maybe it would be helpful for us to get a picture of this together and for us to begin to think if we were gone
1008.18,1010.97, if we were in this place
1011.57,1014.81, and we looked down on our creation
1014.81,1019.25, but les plus was put ourself in the view of humanity right there
1019.88,1024.29, it would be as if we look down and we saw this warm
1024.8,1026.06, on the ground
1026.81,1030.86, and we begin to say my precious warm
1032.87,1035.72, something that's messed up in the warm life
1036.47,1041.03, and i were met to have an abiding relationship with each other
1041.84,1049.67, yet that war has created a fractured relationship and now were distant humanity and warm life
1050.15,1053.51, so what i'm going to do
1053.51,1058.94, as i am going to become the worm
1058.97,1073.64, i am going to take and live a worm's life i'm going to go into the murk and the mare and the the dirt i'm going to be with them in order to redeem the worm
1074.75,1111.65, this is crazy to us because oftentimes we think of god is just like one step better than us or like the best views of humanity but not the goddess amazingly other holy god and that to come down and to be a human with us is incredibly sacrificial it reveals how deeply he loves us because if we were to say i'm going to give up the intellect of humanity i'm going to give up the actualization and the pleasure of being a humanitatem
1112.76,1115.13, this is his overwhelming picture
1115.13,1124.61, it gets lost or put all this emphasis that jesus would come and you would die for us
1124.94,1136.97, the great miracle is that he would come down and be among us he ses lois he says at this way since the central miracle asserted by christians is the incarnation
1137.0,1150.59, this is the taking on a flash when god takes on flesh they say that god became man every other miracle prepares for this or exhibit this or results from this
1151.04,1166.64, just as every natural event is the manifestation at a particular place and moment of nature's total character so every particular christian marcomani fest at a particular place and moment the character and the significance
1167.21,1168.83, the incarnation
1169.1,1205.13, god with us let's go back what is the incarnation of the incarnation is this it is the sun god the son as the pre existent part of the trinity the father son in the holy spirit coming to earth as both fully human and fully god and needeth amazing thing that it is in this place that we begin to see that the jesus who is a part of the trinity jesus was it pervaded when he came to earth there is the father son and holy spirit in doing community together throughout eternity and then we began to see the moment were jesus
1205.13,1254.84, the preexistent son of god comes down into humanity to be both fully human and fully got an immediate get this and understand this because it is the linchpin for everything about christianity all other religions have issue with this if you begin to look at muslim then deny that somehow the divine can be human and so they would deny the this would ever happen he said there's no way that he can be both god and human there's no way we see the ghosts who altered the scriptures to be able to say there's no way that this could happen i say the same thing with mormons who aiantes so this is essential it is statistics
1255.26,1259.04, that is what it says what it means to you is something greater than that
1259.67,1264.68, the incarnation of jesus christ becoming a man
1265.94,1268.79, the greatest act of love
1269.66,1274.43, the primary act of love that all acts of love emanate from
1275.75,1279.56, and so when we begin to think through what is christmas
1279.68,1289.67, christmas is this great act of love this great act of acceptance and when we begin to look at this and say you came
1289.82,1291.32, of heaven
1292.07,1294.65, to be with us
1295.55,1299.21, i hope that you get overwhelming overwhelmed by this
1299.48,1302.63, because here's the thing the incarnation
1303.02,1310.88, allows you to see that without a doubt that you are loved and the two are understood
1311.6,1324.62, you see before christ has happened there is the communication between god and people it was kind of the strained and distant thing i think christ comes into this world and radically changes it
1324.95,1331.58, it was like a moment when i was dating this girl who would later become my wife page
1331.67,1339.32, and we dated we when we begin to date we were only in the same place for about two months out of the year that we dated
1339.5,1368.69, then she went off to georgia to work with college students in the state of georgia and and this was one of those things back this is before cell phone were really prevalent in terms of the ability to speak long toms on them and so we try to figure out how do we connect with each other what does it look like how can we bridge the gap from east texas to georgia and we trotted
1368.75,1390.8, music and all of that let us think you what is that could be how can we do this one time she begins to tell me about this thing that she's doing she's flying from atlanta to disheartening break
1391.1,1438.47, and so this is november somewhere around november and we hadn't seen each other in months and so began to ask tell me a little bit about what you're doing and in passing she said well i'm going to lymington heraclean hour and a half away from here i went to college and i was going to make sure that when she arrived at that air for airport forthwith or die for me to be too few moments
1438.95,1514.79, now she didn't know this she had no clue and i didn't want to in any way kind of communicate that i wanted to to do this and so i didn't ask her what flights i didn't ask her what specific time and then i robbed him the airport and realized that those are two crucial questions onderstand so what i do is i began to look at the board right and find out whether any fighting at this point diversifications about if they could give me names on the flight they said that that is a legal and i said just please you know and so abounding thal and nonsense
1514.97,1529.91, and and i'm getting to this place and it was packed because there is all this weather the slow down everything and i began to realize that there is a delay and she also realized that there is a delay and it was a two and a half hour delay
1530.69,1552.23, so she began to get the idea that i had and she began to say okay two and a half hours what that means is that if i call him and he leaves right now it's an hour and a half from college to the airport a key and if he can come down maybe we could see each other and so she goes to the nearest pay phone she puts in her her quarters and she begins to call my apartment
1553.7,1555.95, she called my apartment
1556.64,1558.14, no one is there
1559.31,1562.67, so she then hangs up the phone
1562.85,1567.47, and she's just thinking i missed that this would have been so cool
1567.89,1570.35, i see her in this room
1571.25,1573.35, and i walk up behind her
1574.19,1576.83, have the roses in my hand
1577.19,1579.8, she put the phone down in disgust
1579.89,1581.39, turns around
1581.78,1583.25, there i am
1583.67,1633.47, and this girl three out she jumps on me like she gets one of the tickets a leap a moment struggling and poking her with all of the thorns as i had not had time to pull the thorns of the race rose like i love you and and you're making me bleed right but there's this moment and every one in this whole term no they're just like wood as having what is this girl screaming about and this is his beautiful moment right and so she is just we go and we have dinner would come back and she is just beneath walk on this planet for delaherche
1634.04,1644.33, there is a moment that we thought maybe we'll get to talk on the phone is our life its talking on the phone but then there was a moment were unexpectedly she saw
1644.36,1646.07, face to face
1646.76,1649.49, the most meaningful person in her life at that point
1650.45,1655.76, she saw my face the face and it was overwhelming in this moment
1655.88,1673.79, so when we began to think what does it mean for us to understand the incarnation it's like we've been trying to to connect with god we've been trying to say god are you there do you love me do you accept me and in all the sudden we come face to face with god who is with us
1674.24,1707.33, and this is key for us understand was it mean for god to be with us and what does god with us really mean i want i tell you a couple of things there's two ways that we really misunderstand god with us the first thing is we underestimate god's love that that god is with us that we began to see this idea that we underminers ates go with god's holding his first we undershirt of god's love that god
1707.36,1716.0, really loves you that when we begin to think about this god with us do you really believe that god really loves you
1718.49,1728.96, do you believe that this is something that when you begin to understand who he is that this was just overwhelm you with his love that god loves
1729.38,1730.55, you
1731.96,1743.9, looking at this miss picture of this in hebrew sea this is overwhelming reality that that happens in our lives and the writer of hebrews was saying do you get it
1744.41,1759.68, to people who are coming after jesus by the time he bruce had written was written jesus was gone off to see but the reality of him coming and being with us was so significant that the writer hebrew says you need to get this
1759.74,1766.52, they write and hebrews chapter two as says this what is mankind that you are mindful of the escorting some eight
1766.55,1782.12, a son of man at care for him you made them a little lower than the angels you crowned them with glory and honor and put everything under their feet with her trying to say what he's trying to communicate is do you understand that when jesus came
1782.21,1786.44, how incredibly loving that was
1787.01,1795.77, this is the unique thing about humanity and we would miss it we miss it on one of two sides that we don't really believe that god loves little us
1796.61,1801.44, that we don't believe that we add that he is mindful of us
1801.47,1812.81, and for some of you think god is distant and got us out there and he has all these rules in has all these expectations of you but you don't believe that in your current state just who you are
1813.53,1827.78, you are percent absolutely loved by your heavenly father and here's a thing it's the same thing you might hear those words spoken to you but what did those words actually mean to you
1828.92,1830.24, i mean
1833.15,1839.78, this man that you would be mindful of them this is this human worm dichotomy right
1841.76,1843.14, he says
1843.26,1845.24, how would you love me
1845.6,1847.58, why would you
1848.84,1852.5, why would you do this the come down
1852.62,1854.51, and be a war with us
1856.16,1859.07, for some of you this is this connection towards this
1859.64,1862.55, i really don't believe that you love god
1863.3,1875.09, kind of have it in theory but it's never actually connected to your life and so you live the up and downs of christian i i feel really accepted okay now i'm kind of messing up and so i don't know if i feel so accepted right now
1876.83,1878.9, the other aspect of this
1878.96,1890.84, is that we would begin to understand that god made us lower than the angels but has given us this thing so we are in this unique position that we understand both the spiritual and the physical
1891.41,1917.84, then we understand who god is and this is our soul that's been given to us that cries out for to be loved by him but also we understand the greatness of who god is and so we misunderstand god's holiness often times and we began to think you know god's just kind of help to my life but not the overwhelming it's not this crazy thing that he is given to us it is just to be overwhelming
1920.66,1923.78, there's a moment tolstoy really quick
1924.14,1933.68, when i was in high school and the republican national convention was in houston and a few of us and now he is going to really weird so
1933.74,1940.31, and a few were asked to as members of the high school began to play to entertain some of these delegates
1940.34,1968.27, and so i am i'm in high school and i'm playing and i've a solo and i play my trumpets there and there's not many people around because again it's a high school and your rights but all of a sudden this guy comes up to me and says he an i really enjoyed a good joke he offendeth was robert downing junior that just said that to you
1970.31,1972.98, i said i had no clear
1973.49,1977.87, it is the same thing for us oftentimes with god
1978.05,1982.4, is there going to be a moment in our life and we realize oh my goodness
1983.0,1986.3, heavenly father heavenly for was 
1986.42,2015.67, feeling himself to us and i completely missed it i live my life on my terms and didn't realize that a holy god wanted to get into my world and radically change it that a holy god set his son not just to be cute and not just for good christmas stories but to be able to do something that would radically change my life and when i ignore him when i live my life on the weekends like he doesn't exist in missing the point
2016.12,2017.23, all
2019.09,2022.6, here's what this really means i mean give you four things
2022.72,2052.21, the god with us means in verse fourteen of heber's it says this since the children have flesh ambulating about sending jesus into this world and him a lining himself with us as people in calling us his children since we have flesh and blood here's the thing he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death that is the devil and free those
2052.39,2068.2, all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death this is huge when you begin to understand that god is both wholly and god is loving the intersection of that is the understand the power of that in our lives is to overcome
2068.29,2091.36, fear of death now you might say i don't really fear death i want you to know that the permeation is sorry that permeates everything in our lives the everything is touched by death every time we have things that we believe that are of god this is the aspect of death that is in our lives and so when you live by any kind of fear in your life
2093.31,2094.66, that is not
2094.87,2097.93, you living in the acceptance in the love of god with us
2098.29,2102.7, that's not you understand it at three that god is with you
2104.8,2136.24, came and he lived as a human in order to break the power of the fear of death that we are held in slavery towards this the acme to set you free i've come out of heaven because i love you so much to set you free from the power of death so overcoming the power of satan in this world to set you free from all the things that you suffer by from all the things that haunt your life from all the things that cause you to have this fear in your world
2137.26,2155.92, the first thing you need to understand his god with us free you from the fear of death the next thing is that god with us reveals god's mercy and his faithfulness this is the character of god that when you begin to understand that god loves you enough that he sent his son to this world
2155.92,2184.21, that you understand that you can walk back to him sat one of the most significant things is that when we begin to misunderstand the love and acceptance of god whenever we have these moments were we forget who we are we forget the love of god we send we say i'm going to go off my way what happens is it's very difficult for us to come back to god because what we believe is that we have to earn it that sheila
2184.42,2192.76, but when we understand who jesus is as revealing himself to be full of mercy and faithfulness it means this
2192.97,2201.07, that there's no way that no place that you can walk it's too far away from god redeeming you because he is full of the mercy
2202.15,2206.44, not only that there's no place where he's going to run out
2206.71,2211.93, it is a desire to chase after you with his love and mercy is faithful in this
2212.29,2214.36, is never going to let you down
2214.93,2218.2, and for some of you need to hear that because you've been asking
2218.47,2235.42, you've been hoping that god would interview in the situation i need you to know that he is merciful and he is faithful in your life and these came to break the power of the fear of death in your life that he is merciful that he is full of faithfulness in this not only that number three
2235.84,2244.48, god with us means that the sin that separates you from god is paid for a says this and that he might make atonement
2244.84,2247.57, for the sins of the people
2247.66,2277.33, what jesus did when he came and put on human flesh came out of heaven and he began to live among us the sin that originally created distance he paid the price he atoned he brought you back to the ability to have a relationship with god where you don't have to be fearful that god is holding something over your head that you don't have to be fearful that you did something and didn't measure up to who god was going to be an now he's attitude
2278.05,2302.92, over and over the thing that i hear that people say but they really mean is this i think that god forgives me but they live as if there's something that they're doing to pay penance with god and when they get tired of paying penance i say i don't know i don't think i believe in god any more i'm going to going to be out of her people that reject god don't understand his love because this is once you have tasted of god's love you never want to leave it
2303.01,2308.08, once you've understand that you are fully accepted you always are drawn back to this
2308.56,2313.84, most attractive thing the most powerful thing in our lives
2313.9,2317.86, we are created this way is the unconditional love of jesus christ
2319.0,2321.52, so when people begin to pull back from jesus
2321.67,2323.32, here's what i know to be true
2323.95,2329.29, i heard the words that jesus loves you but they don't know what they mean
2329.5,2331.03, don't know what they mean
2331.42,2337.18, because jesus would he did as he came down and his life and definers
2337.78,2342.4, brought you back into the relationship that you are intended to be in
2342.91,2345.04, the very beginning in the garden
2345.64,2349.33, and the garden where they were naked and unashamed
2351.37,2353.23, in your presence
2353.38,2354.46, there
2356.08,2358.0, you have shame in your life
2359.89,2363.1, would there be something you don't know if
2363.55,2365.26, came that close to me
2365.38,2374.08, i would really want to experience that because there's some guilt that i have and it neahly god was to be in my presence
2374.32,2376.9, i think i would feel a little bit like
2377.5,2379.48, very uncomfortable in this
2380.92,2383.38, the incarnation the scene
2384.46,2391.42, so that she would feel absolutely comfortable so that you'd be able to say i mean naked and unashamed there's nothing that i'm hiding from you
2393.07,2394.3, the last thing
2394.54,2399.43, god with us means that jesus understand you
2400.24,2401.47, says this
2401.65,2408.88, because he himself suffered when he was tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
2410.44,2412.45, i think in our lives
2412.99,2414.76, than anything else
2415.72,2423.16, the things that most deeply is meaningful to us is when someone understands us
2424.21,2425.32, you think
2425.56,2429.61, my wife all the time we get to arguments the one thing she says to me
2430.45,2432.82, just want you to understand me 
2433.42,2445.96, necessarily want you to validate me i don't necessarily want you to encourage me i don't necessarily want to hear you say i love you i want to hear you say i understand
2448.87,2451.54, you realize that jesus came
2451.9,2463.75, this world so that he might be able to say to you and to me and moments where we are suffering moments that we are struggling moments were ready habit difficult in our lives for us to be able to say
2465.79,2468.19, during this moment and for him to say
2468.82,2470.47, percent
2470.56,2471.88, understand
2472.78,2474.04, you
2474.85,2476.53, i've been there
2476.71,2484.45, so that we don't have a god whose far off that we don't have a guide is like our out there but i'm kind of doing my thing here
2484.93,2487.27, but that we begin to have a god who is
2487.57,2489.25, with 
2490.51,2492.37, a god who is with us
2494.56,2495.76, today
2496.9,2498.58, what i want you to get
2500.44,2504.13, that you would believe that god really loves you
2505.84,2543.97, and that that would not just be words that you hear a pastor say in church this would not just be things that you see when in all of this stuff that you see around in the tomaras the ould be able to peer through the commercialism you'd be able to peer through all the competing things and be able to say overwhelmingly thermic here there's a legendary story here and this legendary story that all this leads to is the god would care enough about us they would hear it come and dwell among us that he would be able to live the life that we should have lived
2544.63,2549.55, empower us to live a life connected to our heavenly father
2554.35,2555.76, every night
2556.06,2557.62, when i'm home
2558.49,2559.9, in a song
2561.76,2564.49, song as jesus loves me
2565.84,2567.19, the year old
2569.08,2575.74, jesus loves me this i know
2575.8,2580.15, for the bible tells me so
2580.84,2585.46, the to him be long
2587.38,2589.12, we
2589.39,2591.76, but he is strong
2593.59,2595.33, and over and over
2596.29,2597.76, hope is
2598.24,2600.55, he would hear those words
2601.36,2603.82, but at some point in his life
2604.39,2606.52, words would have meaning
2608.14,2615.13, those those words would be connected back to not jesus as this distant god
2616.15,2618.97, but jesus is someone who fully loves
2619.57,2620.83, except
2621.49,2623.83, want to have a relationship
2624.25,2625.51, my son
2627.01,2629.17, same thing that out for you
2630.04,2636.19, i want to take a minute and just ask you if you would just close your eyes requite
2636.88,2638.05, i had
2644.41,2646.99, when i asked this question to you
2648.22,2649.72, here in this moment
2654.25,2655.81, he
2657.4,2658.63, flesh
2659.89,2662.86, he came and amy sat next to you
2664.06,2669.73, you could have a conversation with jesus what is it
2672.85,2674.26, you would ask him
2676.24,2680.14, what is it that she would want him to say to you
2684.13,2687.25, what is it that you need to hear
2690.4,2692.38, would you be in that moment
2694.81,2696.7, trying to hide anything
2697.3,2698.53, jesus
2699.94,2701.8, jubata moment
2703.0,2704.68, very uncomfortable
2706.33,2708.31, god and flesh
2708.46,2709.6, next to you
2712.72,2714.58, that that moment
2716.29,2721.3, all that you knew about jesus christ all that you understood about jesus
2721.81,2723.7, fulfilled in your presence
2725.62,2732.04, that overwhelming love would be the exact same love that you have come to experience
2738.19,2741.22, see we get to celebrate
2742.15,2743.35, god's
2743.35,2747.22, but presence with us
2747.7,2750.13, in a moment we're going to get to take communion
2750.94,2758.14, communion represents this very thing that we're talking about his body and his blood were here
2759.1,2772.69, it combines the resurrection and it combines the crucifixion and it combines the incarnation all together in this act that you indeed were here among our minds that you are far off but you came near
2773.5,2781.72, your with us but not only that you accomplished for us what we couldn't do on our own by your
2783.1,2786.49, death and resurrection we now
2786.49,2792.91, have the love of god we have access to that in our lives
2793.78,2795.37, we're going to sing a little bit
2796.36,2807.82, and as we sing i want you to be plato to thee take a piece of bread and dip it into the juice and be able to experience
2807.94,2810.91, the reality of this legendary story
2811.06,2815.26, very tangible way we pray for
2816.82,2826.06, god help us to see this got afraid that we would get in this moment how significant your love is for us and that would be more than just words
2826.18,2834.28, would be incredibly meaningful break through our hearts break through these places that we pull you at arms length in lowest experience
2834.28,2839.98, grace your truth your presence in our life your only name men
