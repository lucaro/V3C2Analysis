59.04,90.12, i had to come now i was about to say that he does three radio shows a week but i think he even does four hours a week i don't know how he does it he so prolific i could never keep up with him but the most wonderful thing about doctor kevin beretania really nice guy so please give a warm welcome to doctor kevin barrett
91.62,94.44, thank you all and thank you boy
94.44,112.26, it's a hard act to follow actually wesley clerk and bonnie falkner body folker is pretty much my favorite radio host one of a very very best out there and you like it have her here in the bay area
113.25,120.78, so the famous seven countries in five years clip from wesley hark you saw it
121.02,129.78, this is a shocking clip what we're hearing from general clark was that ten days after nine eleven
129.93,139.47, there was already this huge plan to completely destroy the middle east or destroy the government of seven countries in the middle east
139.86,150.72, that was pretty fast work it really suggests that this plan had been afoot for much much longer
151.11,165.99, now those seven countries which if memory serve where iraq iran was the last and biggest of them libya syria sudan somali and lebanon
165.99,171.54, have certain things in common one of course they're all moslem majority countries
172.02,178.56, secondly at that time they were all independent countries
178.89,185.58, unlike saudi arabia which is a us quiet state
186.33,193.95, like egypt whose military runs the country owns more than the third of the economy of the country
194.16,197.82, is propped up by us taxpayer dollars
198.39,203.7, unlike morocco the country that i have studied where i did my dissertation research
203.7,218.73, his very closely tied to the us empire and various other middle eastern countries the shakes the gulf that the gas stations with the king around the persian gulf these countries these seven countries were all
218.79,222.66, independent and because they were independent
222.9,228.51, they supported the palestinian struggle against occupation
229.65,243.39, it told westley clark that the middle east had to be totally the map had to be redrawn these countries had to be over overthrown the governments had to be destroyed when he said that back in the early nineties
243.48,244.62, and then
244.98,249.48, policy you allow this to happen after eleven
250.23,283.11, we can assume that both the status of these seven countries as being essentially independent of the us rather than quiet regimes are puppet states and the fact that because of their independence they had to follow the wishes of their own people indeed essentially the unanimous wishes of all of the people of the middle east i accept for the settlers in a squatting in occupied palestine that palestine be liberated that that had a whole lot to do with the reasons that these countries were targeted for destruction
283.14,289.2, and at nine eleven was orchestrated to enable that destruction
297.9,305.79, there is a paper trail that supports the analysis of i just laid out we could go back to nineteen seventy nine
305.97,312.45, when benjamin tentacled the jerusalem conference on international terrorism
312.45,315.45, some people like george w bush
315.63,332.52, henry scooped jackson who was the number one money bags for the military guy in the u s senate a number of other very high level policy was in the military and strategic side of things biennial these people to jerusalem to the jonathan institute
332.52,345.87, named after baby's brother who died in the false leg operation at entebbe airport and they sat down at this jerusalem conference on international terrorism chastises nineteen seventy nine remember the cold was still on
346.17,357.42, they drafted the plants to replace the cold war enemy of communism which was then the justification for the military budgets with the new enemy
357.63,374.31, and naturally since being that yahoo and his people are behind this this so called terrorism as the new civilization enemy is going to be a disguised reference to the enemies of israel and israel expansionism
374.61,380.13, the israelis have been calling everybody who opposes them terrorists sense israel began if not before
380.49,402.39, so as it nineteen seventy nine then in nineteen ninety six richard pearl and a committee of noonshine him were commissioned once again by benjamin anaho who else to produce a document that became known as the clean break document
402.75,428.04, yet proposed a clean break from the previous middle east that in order for israel to transcend not just destroy but to transcend its enemies while that's even more destructive than destroying them ah the regime had to be overthrown in the gin it was this all of these independent regimes that were standing up to intentness
428.04,458.79, so that clean break document drafted by pearl richard pearl the self proclaimed prince of darkness for baby netah a laid out this plan essentially the same plan that dead you know had laid out for the balkanization and destruction of the middle east on behalf of expansion a sire back in nineteen eighty one i believe it was odd you know had published this document in hebrew and it was leaked by israel a
458.82,472.62, that called for israel helping using its assets including the united states to use all of these countries that were still independent of the empire and therefore able to stand up for the palestinians
472.89,497.19, so i do not quit plan called for buccanning the middle east along ethnic and sectarian lines busting up iraq into three states which is now happening busting up syria in too much of warring factions based on their sect in their ethnic which is now happening and busting up the rest of the region as well londonizing lebanon for quatter terms
497.37,539.88, i happened and is what made it happen we sudario sly independent states standing up to the palestinians is now broken into two pieces with the southern half containing all the resources and being dominated by israelis in their friends kurdistan also dominated by israelis in their friends where were so called islamic states and pumping oil through turkey to the israelis to support itself is this these are all these balconies little entities this was the plan from teetered reaffirmed since then in the nineteen ninety six clean break document and then ah that clean break document for redrawing the map of the middle east more into a plan for
540.15,550.29, building america's defenses the same people did at richard pearl's friends the nioka this was published in september of two thousand
550.41,555.36, one year almost to the day perhaps to the day before nine eleven
556.08,568.62, famously called for a new pearl harbor that when a low for these wars of so called preemption or prevention to bust up the middle east only this time
568.68,573.09, a commission for the americans rather than the israelis
573.27,581.79, so i pretended that the reason for this was to somehow created a new american century
581.85,587.43, that was the name of the think tank that produced it the project for a new american century but of course
587.43,594.24, americans didn't just retell have not exactly benefited from nine eleven in the nine eleven wars
594.93,603.33, as nainsell said o nine eleven when asked what was his reaction he said it's very good
603.87,609.03, many caromel and said well not good but it's sure good for israel
609.15,622.26, and he repeated that ten years or so later in eight years later may be he once again was all said were benefiting we in israel a bed in benefiting from one thing and that is nine eleven
622.35,630.96, and the attack on iraq and so on that it created so this is kind of the background that general clark didn't tell you and
631.14,643.53, there i think in the film clip that we saw before that the introduction to this very interesting new film from architects and engineers
643.95,648.96, a very understated estimate of the casualties
648.96,665.25, we saw one million people dead from these words well i just interviewed doctor gian palaemon from a jewish background australian professor scientist an expert on preventable mortality
665.64,685.62, do estimates he estimates that thirty two million people are dead in the muslim countries targeted for regime change and this of course includes some of the other countries like afghanistan and pakistan and elsewhere that have been damaged yemen was not forget yemen that worn on that list of seven countries because they attack the whole islamic world really
685.68,694.38, a million people did twenty seven million by deprivation and about five million or so from direct effects of these wars
694.56,697.26, that's a horrendous
697.32,730.26, these are all islamic countries this is the islamic world where the vast majority of people don't accept and probably will never accept this genocide zionist entity squatting on the holy land in palestine which is holy land to christians and muslims who together are ninety eight percent plus ninety nine percent of the abraham at amathus and it's now and apart i jewish superiority state let ostensibly created on behalf of that tiny tiny minority of people who follow the line of those profits back to abraham who called himself to it
730.38,743.07, so this injustice is not accepted in the islamic world that's why these countries have to be attacked and busted up so that israel can continue to exist and expand and increase its dominance in the region
744.9,748.26, to hear that in the american media
748.59,752.04, why not well moslims know this
752.46,763.41, to show that plus percent of american muslims now niven was an inside job eighty per cent of muslims world wide say the same thing
764.34,770.43, about three quarters say that these nine eleven wars are wars on islam
771.09,777.15, and yet nobody here even knows that that's what more more than a billion people think
777.75,778.86, because
778.89,783.48, we must land i am one myself i've been muslims such nineteen 
783.51,787.32, no voice in the western media whatsoever
787.89,792.87, tom or people are willing to self censor are occasionally brought on
792.87,807.3, or democracy now are what have you to give you a very very water down version of what the whole community basically thinks i no especially the more intellectual types were paying attention to these things
807.93,818.19, there are hundreds of christian radio stations all over the united states promoting a christian scientist point of view for the most part you can't drive through this country without hearing them
818.79,820.23, there are
820.29,864.0, i can't even count how many mainstream media outlets that are dominated by a point of view that is charitably described as tish scientists many of much of it liberal jewish lines run by reasonable people but still basically following that that point of view and there's a very very major grossly disproportionate presence of people from jewish backgrounds in our main stream media and i'm at saying that's metastasian like we all are like in shape by being a muslim and reading about these things in learning about them or from colleagues that universities in turkey and morocco and oran and places like that
864.72,878.55, so there's no voice at all for the group that has lost thirty two million people do to these wars this holocaust in the moslim world is utterly and completely suppressed because the moslim voices have been silenced
878.97,890.07, and that's why i'm trying to remedy that as best i can i'm having very little luck with approaching mainstream outlets directly
890.31,900.63, urging them to bring on representative moslem voices were willing to flat out call it the way that the majority of muslims see it
901.74,906.09, to get on press and talk about these things that's out of tehran
906.27,909.12, ian is independent enough
909.3,917.55, big enough that is they haven't gotten it yet it was the last of the seven countries in five years that were supposed to be slated for destruction
918.27,949.89, and these consenting for an excuse to bomb tehran back to the stone age and busted up it ran the same way they busted up iraq and libya and these other countries in syria of course they want to do the same thing to run in turn it into a failed state and creating
950.34,957.9, so one story short ah i'm for doing what i can to at least get this
957.96,1053.09, i majority view point out so people can consider it and compare it to the available information and decide whether or not we might have a point about some of these things and one such project is the radio free islam project which will god willing create an internet based radio station with twenty four seven three sixty five programming that we can run in on autopilot at first on the internet and then start raising money to put it on some broadcast outlets i think it would be you know or not going to just be hammering on this really hard hard did i just political stuff all the time it'll be a muslim station but i think people would be surprised at the view points they are going to get from a supine and people from the various universities in the muslim world thinking about all sorts of things not just political things from different points of view unoriginality all who are coming out to listen to this in the face of so much pressure to suppress this information i do not acknowledge these alternative points of view that to a large extent are actually correct so thank you all and keep up the truth seeking in the truth telling
1053.21,1061.85, i ahem
1066.53,1100.01, i know what it's like to be trying to teach in the university and have suddenly a huge scandal break out and one day he thought you were he not doing these classes and looking at things from a scholar and may be doing some activism out there on the side they beta little bit controversial two thousand six i was doing teachings on nine eleven at the university of wisconsin and then suddenly all hell breaks loose and orchestrated public relations that makes you a stick i was made into the scapegoat of whipping boy for the scholars for nine eleven truth back then
1100.22,1191.3, our movement is still enough of a threat that they have to keep doing this sort of thing to try to scare off the professors who are supposed to be seeking truth and fearlessly sifting and winnowing wherever truth may why we're supposed to fearlessly go after it but if we do there in bad shape so so they have this strategy of making life miserable for somebody making an example of somebody so the other professors will be afraid to go there that's what they did them in two thousand six and that's what they did to our next speaker professor anthony hall about one year ago to day and orchestrated take down public relations than was tilted him with this horrific slander and he was suspended initially without pay he's back on the payroll but they won't let him step back on campus it's an outrage in a disgrace miss the most insane the attack and academician i have ever heard about in my life it goes lighters beyond what was done to me and you're very lucky to get to hear from professor hall himself was doing a really brilliant job of defending himself in defending academic freedom up at the university of lefrenier canada so i'll let him tell you the whole story in fifteen minutes welcome professor anthony hall hello i a hoping we get one slide and there is a one slide
1191.42,1193.67, and so i
1193.97,1261.08, will become clear with my presentation but on the right there is a baboo operation before and after the before is underneath the thing that appeared on my face book page for a few hours apparently is above so you can see it's been altered and this letter he describes the suspension freedom in canada and thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to this odium this august podium this is a fantastic turn out this is a truly historic moment i feel hardened that we are getting somewhere in the nine eleven troth movement so this presentation fifteen minutes is fourteen hundred words and i've written it out i want to get this story told in an efficient manner so i'm going to try to do that and it's called facing a major attack on academic freedom in canada
1261.11,1327.02, years after the event in stands as striking evidence of an insidious assault on science officialdom dogged adherence to discredit ive town of nine eleven stands as a stark illustration of this phenomena the subordination of scientific method to the higher imperative of imperial war propaganda is epitomized by official tan'talus to formulate a credible account of the nine eleven debacle university have become important sides of this betrayal the sabotage of society's primary platforms of scholarly enterprise forms an essential feature of a more pervasive attack from within everywhere but especially on the internet fundamental freedoms are being menaced we are losing our right and i think for pressers a responsibility to investigate publish publicized and discuss interpretations that might anundee or even inconvenience power
1327.41,1748.85, as the tenure full professor with twenty seven years of seniority at my home institution i'm currently facing a sharp attack on the remaining protections for academic freedom in early october twenty sixteen the president of the university of left bridge michael janssen ed me without pay he also prohibited me from stepping foot on the university of lerida in explaining his action doctor men speculated i might aviated a section of the alberta human rights at the bigness of this assertion certainly expresses it it poses the reality that the severe punishment was imposed without any proper investigation doctor man's abrupt deviation from the terms of the collective agreement with my faculty association we have a lot of rules and policies in universities has established precedence and countervailing responses with broad implications adversarial proceedings in this matter began this august in the left bridge aberdare and that's a big story in a ontell it in detail here as evidenced by the intervention of sixty eight thousand members of the canadian association of university teachers the outcome of this case will in all probably probability significantly affect the future of university governance in canada and beyond dormouse sion letter detailed that there was a possibility that i might be guilty because of allegations of a and i'm quoting here directly my faithful had been used for virulent and semitic comments or you could read that letter you would see that those words i that words and be inferring that is relished jewish individuals were responsible for the terracottas on the world trade center on september eleventh two thousand and one so it's mentioned explicitly that this suspension outside the rules of the university have to do with me connecting what i would call israel first partisans to nine eleven so let's go with that i'm going to go with that before dealing with the manipulation of my thank you my faith book while in the prelude to my suspension allow me to linger on questions concerning the academy and nine eleven along with government median law enforcement agencies universities are deeply implicated in sabotaging the quest for nine eleven truth and many other varieties of inconvenient truth as well the punitive measures directed at me can be seen as a warning to scare other professors into compliance with all manner of official stories nine eleven is the big one but how many official stories are we being told that we know are untrue as for my own reading of the available evidence i'm far from alone in positing that israel first partisans including the american neocomian the project for the new american century are prominent among the many protagonists of the nine eleven crimes these crimes extend to orchis orchestrating the media span rigging investigations and sustaining the ongoing nine eleven cover up to my way of thinking the cover up is the big crime now it's all almost overwhelmed the original crime in written publications and on false lagerbier in extending the investigators many cases of possible falarica rotundifolia i am astonished that the administration of unstained base interpretation of the most transformative event of the twenty first century and he used that word outlie have been criminals in the academy and in an in the terms of the academy that's what this is about new frontiers of subversion are being pioneered in the now avows audacious administrative attempt to criminalis independent academic work what are the implications of subordinating the scholarly judgments of academic experts on campus to the executive dictates of administrators how can the principles of critical thinking be cultivated when adherence to conformity is so aggressively enforced by university administrators the university administration extend its claim of academic control several steps further in the complaint of broad forward to the aberdeen rights commission seven months after i was suspended so first come the punishments and then seven months later come the beginning of some kind of process the complaint begins with its six sweeping statements outlining topics that the complainant want removed from the reach of critical academic examination one of the complaints chiefs assertions is thesmophoria inducing proposition that an inciting directly here from their complaint acts of terrorism between two thousand and one to the present work in fact committed and financed by islamic terrace that the only interpretation acceptable at my university and by implication at other universities in the future by criminal thing another interpretation face book machinations maliciously engineered fatoo operation created the original catalyst of the spear and misinformation campaign leading to my suspension without the originating men mentem set in motion by the faith book operation the campaign to discredit me could not have food it as it did the most public face of this campaign was presented by the canadian extension of the israeli and us base anti defamation league beareth according to benny birth canada and a porpose appeared and then disappeared on my face book while during a short interval on august twenty six twenty sixteen the text of the disgusting digital item proclaimed that the call of holocaust didn't happen and that jew should be in this as a direct quote killed every last one this hansson goes against everything i tried to stand for in my life including in my academic work as soon as i became aware of this blasted in the planet face book post a public confondent it by mid september however my persecutors were fired vance in pushing forward the manufactured crisis by then bannertail was mounting up petition campaign demanding that i be investigated fired and silence
1748.91,1782.45, and not being silenced recently the results of a freedom of information inquire inquiry had brought to light documents illuminating the elaborate defamation pointed my way in the hours and days immediately following the august twenty six passbook operation one document was sent to the university of lettres dent and copied to the premier about bird as well as the alberta justin minister sitting the benares documents author characterized me as an advocate for the murder of jews
1782.66,1992.57, another letter dated first september twenty sixteen was signed by the president of the canadian jewish civil rights association this signature who since passed away sighed the complete text of the offending fatwood post and what i quoted is just a small part of that text at horrific text the letter to doctor man indicated these reprehensible words actually came from my lips i cannot understand why doctor man did not at this juncture properly investigated by consulting me directly and conferring with the university of lerida association instead the president opted to punish to push ahead to push ahead with drastic action based on incomplete information combined with the intense pressure brought to bear on him from an extremely influential external political lobby to finishing up now none is called hate speech deceptions none of my persecutors as yet identified the true source of the offending face book item my own research into the matter including my email exchange with partners and that's been garrison's face that has been photospheric widely reported to be the creator of many internet personalities all of whom generate abundant hate speech deceptions that term i came up with from various ethnic and ideological perspectives goldberg's case expose as much about the wholesale manufacturing and misrepresentation of so called hate speech to justify censorship on the internet in my case an atrocious digitate was strategically inserted with the aim of ruining me professionally and personally the intervention of internet leviathans like google and faith is especially aggressive when it comes to disappearing material critical of the israeli government treatment of palestinians my own experience with the canadian branch of the anti defamation leaventritt points to the strength of this pattern why is it that these zionists dinosaurian is being tossed with the strategic responsibility of censoring and categories you tube videos as illustrated by william peppers development of civil litigation to bring to light the us government's role in the tragedy suffered by the family of martin luther king junior we rarely get criminal trials pressed against the world's most powerful interests and opportunities of possible fuselages but especially nine eleven have been rendered especially immune to any kind of trial that would put before the public evidence garnered from genuine investigation of the facts perhaps the reference to nine eleven in a university administration's effort to condemn me for academic thought crimes and speech crimes will force the food forbidden topic into some kind of evidence based tritical procedure when it comes to understanding the real dynamics of who did what to whom a nine eleven the truth must prevail thank you
