0.36,10.44, the one thing that bothered me the most was the fact that
12.03,15.87, i know that from this day on a life was going to change
16.8,21.48, entirely from top to bottom there was no way it was goin to be the same
21.57,23.97, the one in the 
24.21,40.02, i was actually at home i was off duty i was listening to how it's done on a radio no stranger to fish and poles to both snap a fishing with my wife at the time was a beautiful beautiful sunny clear day
40.02,41.1, and
41.16,45.84, just as i stepped on the ferry i heard a noise there was a
46.05,48.27, picture of the trade center
48.6,50.61, a hole in tower on
50.64,53.25, as to one right away because the tenant
53.28,56.16, that's what my dad worked i called my mother
56.46,59.67, and i said i said he may hear from dad this morning
59.85,61.74, she had started crying
63.6,65.58, the second plane had
68.25,69.93, started to
70.08,71.22, at
71.76,74.88, you could actually see the south building
75.06,76.56, to one side
76.65,81.96, half way up was starting to lean and not five minutes later with collapsed
82.2,83.31, i started
85.14,88.2, i really had not known what to do myself
89.01,91.05, hoping that he had gotten to work yet
91.29,93.0, he was on the train
93.21,98.91, he had gotten out of the street and looked up and because the communications are down maybe he just couldn't get through
100.08,102.27, had no idea was happening
103.71,106.11, thereafter the pentagon got it
106.2,113.61, i started getting really badinant i heard that there was another plan and i was afraid that that whole day would just be dropping planes all over the place
113.73,120.75, so it took me almost a day before they got me on a train going north and that was
120.81,123.18, the afternoon of the next day
123.21,125.61, and they put me on the
125.61,134.37, last little roommate in the back of a of a sleeper car and took almost twenty four hours to get up there
134.49,139.92, that process the word got around that train that there was a red cross worker
141.54,147.57, and i didn't realize i guess it was the porter you somebody who let the word out but i
148.02,156.24, my door and it was somebody asked me if i was going to be at the world trade center and i said i didn't know but i was on my way up there
156.39,162.06, he would give me the name of a relative or a friend and said please please look for
170.4,173.64, so
174.45,175.95, the names
177.6,180.33, i promised on my old what i could do
180.87,191.34, when they start collecting people who are injured when the tower fell they were brim bringing them over to the jersey city marinari was we were housing them down
191.46,196.59, to get the dust off and get a lot of their eyes and their poor nose mouth
196.71,198.12, a sound
198.87,200.67, i expected to hear
201.15,207.87, i don't know what i expected to hear but i thought it would be very noisy out there and it wasn't and then it dawned on me they were listening
208.38,211.41, see if they can hear anybody buried under that rule
211.71,231.63, all smoke and brian had a tough time seeing your eyes would burn and you had a tough time breathing i've looked lost people love the cancer because of this i've had one friend i almost lost his vocal cords i get tested
231.63,233.22, for cancer
233.52,237.96, a basis you know this is stuff that i'll live with
238.23,240.81, into
241.38,245.4, most people in the entire metropolitan area
245.88,247.41, now some one
247.44,249.0, perished that day
249.6,256.95, i had a relative and five friends of mine that perished that day my mom said he's gone is not coming home
259.41,261.12, i have a fair
261.96,266.1, after the war i got back on the train
266.1,268.65, back and kept my messengers

278.07,279.69, months after
280.32,281.85, every day
282.54,287.34, of course the people who were trapped for the ones above the impact sent couldn't get out
288.21,292.08, and of course the heroic fire department
292.11,299.25, who are on their way up to try to get to them to make the rescue they got caught in the collapse
300.48,311.85, i think of the thousands of people that were saved i guess that's what sticks in my mind pleasant firm and as we get paid to run by the you know till one in the burning buildings
312.18,317.79, the civilians that day that made it out of the building and ran back in to help their friends
317.79,325.32, there those are the real heroes the construction workers and walters that ran back to that place
325.59,328.56, start taking out
328.74,343.05, as to that i have the sacrifice there the eros to look at each other and be happy that their neighbors and and look at neighbors and say you know we hedgeth let's try and work it out and that was the
344.52,349.86, treat was one of the things that came out about it that people help each other
