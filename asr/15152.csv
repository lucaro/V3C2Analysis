3.36,50.46, welcome to the balanced body poncas my name is at well and i'm one of prevalance physical therapy and plates in alemannia joining me to day as rosamond and when i'd like to talk to you in this segment about is thrasabad its importance in the golf swing on the racial billies important because in the golfing we have what's called the primary access of rotation or the spinning in the golfing world and we want to be able to rotate around that spin angle without our body coming up and moving into different positions it should stay around the angle throughout that most of the swing if a person is not have adequate traffic mobility which we often see as they're going to get it anyway they can so they're going to create they may come in and lose posture by coming up and compressing into the lower back they might also
50.46,57.39, bringing the shoulders up and having a flat shoulder plain so what we're going to do is a little test test for tressilian
57.48,109.59, what i've done it i've taken to golf clubs and i can take two bowls or even just tap and on the floor and a forty five degree angle where a go ahead and bring that dog up over your head and just behind your back all right and keeping your knees together and facing straight ahead where to go ahead and allow retepora all the way to one direction towards me and what i'm looking at as the sea if the angle of this now is past the angle of the club which she just about makes it let's go ahead and do it to the other direction and here she's able to make it pass that angle good and back into that angles about a forty five degree angle that panoram there able to easily do this both direction fact there probably close to fifty five degrees so if you're golfer is unable to rotate pass this forty five degree angle than they really need to work on their mobility so let's do a couple of exercises here on the trappiste
109.92,117.42, there now there i mean pick thee up that address the reservist's come on over here to
117.84,123.12, the table and i have seated
123.51,160.74, they were many have discreetly stately back of the trees are of the edge here no and it's it's optional what you would like him to be standing oroolia something underneath their feet let's go ahead and his place your arms at night agree to discontinue one of the uprights of the cattle and now were no go ahead and take this hand and hold on to the upright here this hand is going to win take hold of the tower bar and we were on to do as we're going to imagine when you rotating the bar and the upright and opposing directions as you rotate good and then come back to center again were going to pull the tower bar and the upright away he rotate and back to center
160.74,163.56, one more time pulling them away
164.07,214.56, center by me having her poll what we're doing is trying to have her engage and stabilize through that shoulder girdle is she's going into that rotation she's going to definitely need that when she's holding the club up at the top of the back swing awedly would repeat this on the other side so then after you have them do that we want to make the more functional so i can have them come into standing and here we don't need a spring that barbarically and i put the bar approximately so stifford with a bad at your chest justice of god ranthar up and when i go in to what would be a golf position so bending slightly from the hips and these and go and let's take this hand and were just going to grasp on to the upright here and same thing we're going to try to pull apart the tower and the upright good and back to center again pulling apart there we go that's it and rotating
215.28,224.55, back center one more time pulling apart so now we're getting that rotation of the thraffic spine in a functional position for that golfer good and were going to relax
224.88,226.59, okay
226.98,255.66, now the next exercise is going to be one where we can actually use a spring in here so what i'm going to do this set is interesting so we're going to take to bless brings an i'm goin actually chris cross the springs and the reason why i'm doing this is i want to make that bar little bit higher this is the caribbean from the safety strap and i'm going to use a handle here so i hopes the mittened this is the real able to swivel or grip as goahead lie down on your side
256.23,262.59, the ideal if you have a little something that they've got more broad shoulders in a place underneath their head
262.98,299.97, slike there i'm going to play this a little bit slowly behind her so we have somewhere to rotate okay so i have them stacked on their hips seceshers the bottom panels were headless rotate ergo the bottom hand is it a prestige angle and let's go ahead and take hold of our grip there and so from here when i take a breath in as you exhale stabilizing socially in a row that through the rip cage good and he should come back up keeping the shoulder stand exhilerating back good so this is a nice scampishly exercise but also thoracic mobility so we might have them do this three to five times here
300.48,319.86, and back up then what we can do a nice assist eat so take this hand place it behind on that bar there were a take this hand at his place at right there on this spar now what's going to be nice in this position is that i'm going to be able to stabilize her and let's go ahead in a rotate i'm going to give her a little bit of assistant stretch on the way up and back down
320.22,339.15, i feel good and back one more time so she is really liking us and back good and sir we'll go ahead bring that back down and altoona from you so those are a couple of great exercises that she can do to improve the racicot for gaffer
