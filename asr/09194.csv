0.42,5.37, even though my work doesn't have a landscape i could teach people with nothing around them
19.32,40.83, i grew up in solidity or murray utah and i wanted to be an artist in the time i was really young i think when i was probably in the second or third grade i told my parents i wanted to be a disney in a meter i think probably because that was like one of the only 
40.86,42.42, the only
42.48,44.58, i knew you could be an artist
44.61,63.57, we always had our books around like my parents had a lot of like classical art like we had a book on microanalysis i was just obsessed with them i would look at them all the time and i would draw from them and i made out from the timely little and i knew that kind of what i wanted to do
63.63,80.52, i took a lot of myth classes i growing i have my mom teaches in the language literature she studies classics and we just had a lot of books about myth story telling and reading and story takings always been really big in my family so
80.52,83.58, that those classes really interested me and i think that's
83.76,86.7, work that way into my work i definitely
86.94,101.07, marie a lot and reverencing like traditional stories or themes that crop up in like multiple cultures and so that plays a big heart
101.43,111.51, i love classes on evolution and the environment and animals and those shipowner my work but i don't know if that's because of those 
111.57,113.61, living in salt lake
113.7,147.6, there's a lot of artists from utah that make not just traditional landscape work but work where the landscape plays an important role even though my or doesn't have a landscape i could casually people with nothing around them i think that like the vastness of that space really does reference the landscape here the intangibility but i keep like testing on people like worthing that this at home that people who grow up in spaces like utah like salt lake where you can
148.2,178.23, i get up above everything an made that like we can go to the mountains i think whenever people talk about like tours in utah i always hear this like you can be in nature and like it minutes but it's not just that you can be in nature it's that you can be up above everything that man has made in this valley and you can see it completely dwarfed by not just the mountains that are bigger than everything but like the vastness of the land stretching around and the sky and the
178.32,200.37, makes me feel makes me a small and so i i mean i can imagine that somebody who grows up in a city where the city is huge and there's nothing bigger than their buildings and there's nothing bigger than that than that human made space would have a very different perception of their place in the world so i think the bathos up in my work because
201.06,211.59, people are always so small within their environment even if they're environment has nothing in it they are still small they're kind of insignificant in that space
213.42,225.9, for the past two and a half years have been on the exhibitions coordinator for the fore boards and for the library and that's been really interesting as far as a coordinating with artists and 
227.37,242.22, helping like a way out a show and so i get to have you know work on the small personal stuff and also realize these like much bigger installations that i would necessarily do on my own with my work although my work is kind of like huskily
242.25,245.01, a lot of fine things that have to be installed 
245.25,246.84, the helpful
248.73,256.98, i applied for a show a two person show with care disdain at callery and we
257.01,264.21, we decided that we wanted to like transform the entire gallery space so our goal is to like
264.57,265.68, really
265.92,273.63, as much work for us all as possible we had we were going we didn't want to just hang drawings or do any of that we wanted to have
273.72,286.02, paper installation in drawings and like really play with the lightness pace and so that was like my first experience of producing like an entire shows forth a work
286.98,288.18, and
288.51,329.52, that kind of informed like how i have thought about every show since more recently i've been doing the slide projector pieces and so they are kind of just like one piece but the slide projectors themselves of these like old machines to lengthy ham and the glow and the smelling burning dust and so they have a personality and they'd have to sit on a podium and then there's all that space between where that they sit and what their projecting too and the way that that light projects all of that space is filled with something in silke that and then of course like the clicking in the interactive quality that somebody's coming in and having to like
329.67,361.41, with that he turned the page and mean i always talitha first shall again we set like a pretty high standard could be created all these invidious that we put out where they were like silly videos to create like hypate show and also just to show the process because i think the if you're not if you don't make it or you are not around it all the time it can seem kind of mysterious or sort of romantic in its not it's like dirty and silly and thirsty know so we wanted to kind of lift the veil from that
362.22,385.02, i taught like a like a book making drawing or chapar a lot of i think it's interesting that drawing is something that all little kids do and they are so free with it all draw anything in their like so proud of their drawings and on rohans to people but once they get to a certain age every one is ashamed of their drying who like publican draw as if it's like
385.11,387.06, a standard and we all
387.33,392.07, suddenly understood that there was a standard or so embarrassed of our inability to
392.13,407.64, that word so i wanted to do this work tremere you i do blind contorting so that people call participants came in and they had to not look at what they were doing and just look at the thing they were drying and
407.67,412.68, without looking to try to break that like that
413.28,428.16, self conscious barrier down and it was successful it was really interesting that the kids that came in by love that they got that right away and then a lot of the adults really enjoyed it too but it kintoki little bit longer
429.18,447.27, i just have some things that i wanted to figure out in my art practice that i don't there sort of like little starter ideas and i ate one of see how how the progress and usually a show is really a good way from to motivate me to make something but i think that
447.48,452.01, is not the project for that like i need time to like figure out
452.01,456.63, do it and i just want time to do that
456.72,459.3, so i'm trying to take on too much stuff
462.57,467.34, that's okay
