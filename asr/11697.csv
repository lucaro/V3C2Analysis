5.13,30.45, expression but came about because i was of new york and pregnant and i suddenly began to notice the huge mound of celebrity moonites is amazing that some unite something for the graphically that you never noticed before but also they all the same and the same messages were coming out so as curious to see what was going on in fonografo i kind of turned my red
30.78,33.72, find out too see what was going on
33.93,40.65, and i offering on and it was really interesting but it wasn't getting showing a huge mound
40.74,49.47, when you've been gathered together in a group show before so i thought that would be a really interesting thing to do to put it altogether
53.1,76.86, when you're putting together an exhibition is a process of editing really i i gather i cast my net very widely and then i take it down and take it down to begin to make sense to show which a very different thing from making senses a book and it was absolutely an exhibition first and then a book 
76.89,84.87, i have to work not only visage her but also conceptually together and at a contradict one another as well
85.68,116.34, over see the way that you can go about this subjective are very varied and what i didn't want to do was to make it a didactic illustrative exhibition i didn't want to show his pregnancy has child growing older that he absolutely not what i wanted to do i wanted to look at them more kind of thorn issues around maternity and represent representations were important letter so photography always played a rumpot role in the how
116.34,118.23, let the work
121.41,127.62, this picture and habit was really a centerpiece for the exhibition for me
127.62,130.08, i saw it years ago
130.17,146.4, i was just stunned by it not only its physical size but also the idea of like those russian dolls where you have a house hideous and person and a spider being represented within and this kind of cycles of mothering
146.91,170.49, exit and domestic is really about the shape shifting that's needed for women when they become a mother and the shifts and identity that especially come across in this work which we have here a mother that's past all bearing age but she's trying to sort out who she is fifteen to be a mother and how she thought about how she's represented
170.79,176.85, it's there and everybody's work but overseer apparently another
178.86,189.33, work does hear at the doctor's gate is really an looks at ideas of excess and abundance in a lot of the work lost certainly
189.45,203.61, part but if you think of the comte that we live in and the father everything is photographed and the bumps some integram babies every where a lot of the work cimento that contrack ground
203.61,223.92, and so for example lena's work she's photographic again and again and again every month something that's not usually photographed so that that idea was really pivotal to work in the topical and count o that we had the other half of homerically mused
224.07,230.49, when i went into that space the sense of the loss was so palpable
230.76,245.55, i really knew that i had to do a show that was around that time to do anything else would be to appropriate and so the works selected for that show or deals with a certain kind of lost not necessarily a death but
245.55,252.78, lost really ready there and so they have a kind of counter point of one another they kind of
253.62,255.0, weave a web
255.0,257.76, one another back and forth between the two sides
261.42,273.39, i think i want audience has to come away with things something they hadn't seen before or thinking about motherhood in a way that they had informed about it before and so i want people to just just kind of
273.84,275.25, and
275.52,278.85, the minds of it and cardinal kindness and empathy
278.91,280.44, towards
281.7,283.02, people in the better
