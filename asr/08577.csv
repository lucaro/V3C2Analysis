0.24,58.05, my first cato was on my eighteenth birthday man came patches then came eleutheria lot of teenagers i suffered from depression and the best part about being a teenager was patches because she was always there i would walk in the house after like doing whatever i was so bad she had i was doing drugs or i was out later if i was parting or whatever and she would just give me some look every time i oh hey i'm so glad your home with a hang out and cut all and it was like consistent across the board always would happen in that was really also a need that i had her for about fourteen years and i did know i had to memorialize her with a tattoo
58.05,62.22, so she's now on my arm and with me for ever
62.22,78.6, i anointed
78.84,94.23, in the tertiary cat art fine art is a really popular right now and more popular member noticed
95.31,102.93, i always knew from ever since i started seeing patiole loved to memorialize their pets
103.17,104.07, and
104.22,119.7, i have them myself so i don't know it was natural to do them the cat the thing really started after i did but kept kitty in a teacup on my husband's slag
119.7,176.85, i started to cats and then i got commissioned to do some cat art and then i get request to do another cat too and then it's just these things happen you know they they they spiral once do something that some may think is great they get it and then they tell a friend and the friend gets it and infringes it and in pretty soon you have a whole portfolio full of categorical never antonietta i don't i don't remember it was at the looking on and i saw the old casino may have pointed her
177.3,232.05, are constantly asking me for them and i am never tired of doing them will for ever be grateful for anybody who lets me tattie pet on them because i know how much it means and and i i really like to be able to share that with them because they usually tell me the story of how awesome their cat is or halesome cat was and i then can do the same about patches and my cats now i think he eventualities yet wearily federally generates the top the top third secure that the way they imitating but i'm going to assume the finical of them are really special and a lot of them some of them were just super fun and the person gets a cattarese
232.08,234.57, they just want something that feels good
234.57,317.16, that's what i love about tattooing you don't have to get attentive that's so supervening full and i like so serious sometimes it just makes me feel good were you look at it when i'm not tattooing in drawing and in painting and in focusing on on learning new techniques and how to improve the lot timetables because you're our commissioned for things your commission for paintings or you commissioned to do a tattoo so give to draw the design for the tattoo that can be stressed also the best when bessarabian the cats around is you know i'm just freaking out like inanimate here painting and don't be over there the corner sleeping i just in even each of my coiloo at him for a minute and take a breath and go people are very surprised when they hear i only have two cats cause hear me talking about cats they seem my art and the like have like fourteen cabs and no i mean i have to i think too is a great number and i think that's what's changed the typical cat lady from what it was used to be one one woman alone with like twenty cats and now it's like no it's anybody you're in a relationship or your single or you have a roommate and you have a cat
