6.0,30.51, we hear it striking thousand seventeen and i'm speaking with petrak whose the senior vice president of product for cedric can you tell us a little bit of it your roll and how you came to become part of the trick family yeabsly it's got to be here and it's gretton carriglass year
30.63,34.62, i had spent most of my career and microsoft over years
34.65,51.21, i worked on product at office team and also individual studio and actually helped both of them through the transition from one printed and i here running production
51.27,62.43, inside the company from independent business units to a unified engineering team and unified producing and unliving product as we go through a similar transition
62.46,66.63, to the flour also here so it's exciting times to be at cedric
66.84,75.15, i mean one thing that we notice is that there's a much more defined focus on security
75.21,83.73, sabot that shift yeah i think for customers formiliar with our products many of them have attributed
83.88,94.68, security to be one of the main reasons that they've deployed we haven't necessarily always talked about it as a capability within our products but whether it's an added
94.74,136.89, securing application delivery to anoint or next gale securing your network or features that we have in chariot right management and document protection there's been very strong capabilities in all of our corrodes for many years i retribution in recent times security really has come to the forefront with our customers and it has become much more of diathermancy and our corrodes
138.24,152.79, you mentioned the transition to the cloud what does that look like yeah i think it's in different for every company and so certainly i'm getting to borrow from some of my previous experiences in an effort that i've done in the past
152.79,198.54, but there are some unique opportunities here here at tricks in moving to the cloud first of all we know that many customers want to manage their enterprise infrastructure more and more from the cloud and not from their own data centers that that trying is happening whether their moving to a public loud are the moving to salapia ions in the cloud they are also moving our work logs are to the cloud and so the steps that were taking first of all starting about a year ago we moved the management controlled plane for all of our cerisoles into the cloud and with continued de partner with the large public loud as our in an amazon in particular but all of them with regard to helping people move the individual work on to the cloud also as the first thing
198.54,214.62, second thing is we are building new services the eerie that we announced yesterday a great example of a service that would be cloud based not lacemen you have to move everything to the cloud to access it were definitely going to allow you to build
214.71,221.64, at service as an extension of your own prenomen of osiander example
221.7,241.08, their many advantages a building that service in the cloud it's going to scale it's going to be resiliency its goiloor across the globe and almost things would point to a building it in cloud forest rendering it through the clouds so that a great example of us in building this hybrid experience
241.08,252.51, he combined the best of the unpracticality that customers know and love to day and connecting that up to new capabilities that we build exclusively in the cloud
252.6,256.92, what is a most exciting product that
257.4,259.95, you're really excited about
260.34,299.07, let's talk about the analytic service as an example i think there are obvious baby steps that we can take with analytic we have a lot of inside into what's going on whether it's network traffic analysis that we can do with nectar with estan understanding of the files that are moving around organization through sharpie understanding what's happening to your and point your phone your table at because of receiver and zanasanes on all gosport so we know that there is a lot of insight that we can already garner from that information but if you look at the advances that have occurred in a and machine learning we know that dad
299.31,306.15, more of that data into the service a training or models on more of that data would allow us to help customers
306.15,320.04, detect a normal is much more what more easily particularly in the area of security but i think that's just the first of many areas i think performance is another one where that olivier could really have in impact for our customers
321.36,354.06, the talk about the secure browser but we didn't really get a good explanation as to what it is can you elaborate a little more on the yeah so so first of all we already have capabilities with regard to secure browsing in anapaestic cancan do the sedatively publish a browser has a secure application that runs inveterate floud what we've decided to do is actually carve out that particular scenario that unique scenario that people have with regard to
354.18,403.26, see web browsing and hosted dedicated service in yurta is vines running a browser remotely that any use can connect two and isolate all of their web rousing traffic from their device from their desktop so think of it as a special use case for the general purpose as an a publishing model but but optime around around we were browsing and we know that this is you know there's two things that we know today that about security are working their eisenstein
403.26,428.82, still the prose if you want to actually spear fish or zero day some one the best way to do it is to an browser so we're going to do lots of things to work on helping customers manage identity helping customers use multilateral indication et cetera in their their applications but were also going to work on on browsing as a particular use case where we know customers are unable and its tough to keep up
428.91,432.09, one of the things that will also do in that service is
432.27,448.02, we will take responsibility for maintaining a current version of the browser instance that runs in that service sorais been the latest one but always be fully hatched and we know that even a can be a chillsome times for customers for just maintain their images in a current state
449.85,453.48, i guess where do you see the future
453.48,457.95, going is it going to be more security and more cloud based
461.04,498.33, so let's talk for a moment about the sort of the biggest announcement we made yesterday which is the new unified work face the securities that really is the culmination and combination of products coming together to deliver the penetration and really be the complete experience so that i think the first step
498.45,509.04, second thing is we see a continued need for integration of my digital work base with my physical work pace and so whether it
509.07,555.54, my fun knowing what kind of meaning and attending or responding to the physical room i mean my digital work pace on my computer recognizing that there is a large display that i could cast it to north shared with other people my emmy environment being aware of who else is around and if i need to contact them so that whole idea of marrying together the best of the digital work base with the physical work space particularly with it as the bridge between those two the thingthat a huge area of for us to explore but of course as as you write it pointed out security is going to remain security reliability outsailing to man at the center and the more we take on the responsibility of
555.54,567.51, running services on behalf of our customers the more important it's going to be for us to really have enterprise grave security reliability performance that that are allowed customers to run
567.63,571.2, mission christliness which they do today on our platforms
571.65,575.94, thanks peter taking the time to speak with him god
