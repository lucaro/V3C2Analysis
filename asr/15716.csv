10.38,33.66, we got to a suburban here that has about miles on it and this is one of our regular customers guards and we wanted to do a state of health on the fuel pump in a vehicle so what we've done it we've gone into the fecundative that allows us to quickly turn on it of the jesuit
33.72,44.76, also works pretty well to allow you to analyze control circuit on that as well so i've got another one in all on the vehicle but if you're not familiar with the car
44.91,47.4, you want to go into your service information
47.43,54.33, and look for that component locator so we've gone into a direct hit here and typed in filomel go for
54.39,56.13, component locations
56.43,58.62, this is a leader
58.92,70.02, and fell particolare there located in under hood fused relay center so gamely is nice because when you take this cover off
71.01,73.77, the idea the relays he just lay it out there
73.77,74.73, we've
74.73,76.08, the relay
76.86,81.03, inserted the connector from the act of it
81.09,83.46, we've got it plugged into the vehicle
83.73,88.8, second thing that we did as we have installed a fuel flow meter
89.19,94.08, and the fuel flow meter here we've gone from the fuel filter out
94.32,101.64, to this and then back out to the engine and then we're also looking at the current because on the end of the
102.84,107.55, it you've got to lie here and so that is the load
107.85,112.47, the fuel pump so we'll be able to look at the field pomp current on the scope here
112.77,114.21, and
114.27,118.95, the current prove installed got the pegall set up
118.98,123.69, all i need to do is hit the one button here and turn the fuel pump on
123.99,127.08, we're looking for is we're looking for testiness
127.41,131.28, on this is between and pounds
131.46,135.54, we're looking for fuel flow at the same time so let's watch what happens here
136.95,138.45, we get flow
139.08,143.55, i went up to about one and then quickly dropped down to zero
144.09,148.02, we're making about psi
148.71,150.57, there runs a
150.96,155.37, if we look at the scope here so let's just turn on the scope
157.71,159.81, we're drawing about six
161.46,164.01, let's lower this down here
167.37,169.86, camps and we can stop it
171.24,173.7, we can maybe measure the
173.7,174.78, time
177.21,178.41, pick
180.12,184.53, we got one two three four five six seven
186.21,187.68, the second
190.56,192.63, between those two
192.72,196.08, we love our
196.17,198.9, pattern looks good but the problem here
199.11,206.85, that this thing should be flowing about you know my estimate probably about point gallons per minute
206.91,208.17, we're not doing that
208.41,211.11, the thing that happens here when we shut the popoff
212.76,217.89, that the pressure immediately became as dropping down below twenty pounds here
219.99,225.78, we're theorizing that we've probably got a leap inside the fuel tank
225.78,227.28, explain
227.94,229.62, drop and full pressure
230.16,231.84, but no flow
232.35,235.8, come right up to about ten drops right off
236.91,240.69, we're going to take the pill pump out of this vehicle and inspect
243.33,253.14, okay we've got her suburban that we tested earlier we found that the fuel pump although it was providing system pressure wasn't providing any flow
253.2,257.43, as soon as you shut the key off the pressure decayed down to about twenty pounds
257.55,258.45, quickly
259.14,261.09, when a head and sold the pump
261.18,269.1, took it all apart we replace the sender and the pomp and unfortunately the first pump that we got from the salon
269.19,285.96, defective as depend it is about leaders for our about gallons per hour is what that pump does and it produces about psi
285.99,293.97, we put this pop in and it was very very noisy it would produce pressure the top but it would drop down
294.0,297.93, it wouldn't flow at all so there's nothing being returned back to the tank
298.2,307.23, we took it apart looked at it decided to get another cup in it and we went on and replaced it and now we got it got everything running well so i just wanted to show you that
307.35,312.39, and so we've got the fuel flow meter and stalled
312.42,316.08, an say the system pressures actually maintaining about 
316.2,318.72, in eight
318.81,323.07, has been sitting for you know approximately ten minutes or so
323.4,327.39, so i've got the activate unit hooked up here
328.14,330.15, and i'm also connected
330.27,331.26, to
331.35,339.06, the hand i've got a car poother so i'm going to actuate this up and then we'll talk about the current of
339.12,340.29, this
340.86,342.66, pomp is on
343.29,346.11, and you see now or is
346.17,349.23, we're flowing about point 
350.04,352.47, for
352.65,354.12, allons per minute
355.95,358.38, and that's looking really really good
358.5,363.09, i'm going to go and shut that off and we'll just go back and look at the scope require
363.45,365.43, and you say your prompt
365.79,370.05, and about and a half as and then normalize
371.37,373.38, let's take a look
374.07,375.6, so
375.99,381.12, or to one to three four five six seven eight
382.59,387.36, that gay right there i am barefooted on eight in there
387.48,390.0, we're about our
390.57,402.57, earlier when we put the first pump in there we had very very noisy twenty six hundred are and the recover here this idea
402.57,405.3, first one and then
406.17,408.72, is there is our start up
408.9,411.87, the original pump that we pulled out of the vehicle
412.02,412.89, and
413.4,417.57, had an internal league the clamps were actually loose around the fuel pump
417.84,422.85, and you'll see that the arm here shows are so
422.91,427.98, making a pressure but as soon as he said the key of it led all the
428.04,430.08, the pressure of
430.2,432.57, i'm
433.14,436.65, i hope that this was alighting at some point
436.68,440.82, and provided some additional information thanks
