261.57,263.58, i'm really good about
263.85,264.69, face
265.2,274.17, but i do have issues with joan reprinting in calisthenes like that and so usually when i first start
275.34,280.65, he first start running i build up a lot of cases and you can definitely sort of
280.98,282.33, tis but
282.48,285.48, i got a tall like
285.6,289.32, important blister here that immediately went away
289.35,290.64, there
290.67,291.57, and
292.26,295.38, this is the most disgusting thing i ever
295.44,297.66, i have allister
297.69,303.0, and i sometimes get in here too i mean if one giant calister but 
303.87,306.93, like little out feeling
309.12,324.45, i'm also work out are also ottokesa the shoes that i got actually this will get into how i hurt myself the last time so i got my injury
324.45,341.64, as technically this year but it started last year and went into this year i think i got them because of the pair costamagna later these artist composes that i work out in because i do and of a lot of curio jumping around type working out again i used to
341.67,356.31, and then something heavy pale fair its nest assassins i put being in the description below as i have shown you before i typically run with these shoes
356.64,363.9, he these are the moral terms and i have the men my phone
365.91,367.83, the brooms
368.16,375.36, but actually another friend of mine hiawatha me a pair o books
375.75,380.13, i really like i had never heard of brookport these
380.13,384.39, actually provide support for me and
384.48,396.93, the joints in my feet her a lot or if i am running on you know and especially hard or very rocky ground i have to use those because
396.93,401.91, yet running she's are just not going to cut it these are the brooks pure
405.96,413.7, all i know about them and on to my last peruse this is the problem and even to run in the winter
413.85,417.99, i needed a pair of running shoes so i just went to a shop stairs time 
418.83,419.61, like
420.06,424.41, no running shoes and so i described appear of keen
424.8,430.32, for the record i like em and i do like the shoes you can not
430.32,431.73, running
432.06,437.55, they the support in the man made me run funny at put too much
437.55,444.54, pressure on the outside of my knee because i was compensating for my feet being uncomfortable
444.6,447.36, and how they were going down
447.75,453.54, and so i mean i got them because they were waterproof and because they were warm
453.57,458.55, and that's great but you have to have a pair of shoes that's not going to screw up
458.55,482.79, running style right now i'm just kind of come to turn the back that i'm probably not going to run during the winter i find something else to do and sticking with the two pairs of shoes here and i heard and i'm starting to believe what i heard in this regard that it is kind of a good idea to switch off your running shoes every once in a while just cause gives your
483.81,493.74, she is of your stand you got a you know reassorting and everything and also you know depending on the type of place you're running you need to
493.77,501.6, about the injuriam really happy with the shoes that were right now intirely good about it so
502.11,509.34, yeah and both of them have tended space in the toes so now my tone as of ontology
