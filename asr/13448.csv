31.71,36.78, really to trace as where i live there is not that much
40.11,49.47, the
49.8,84.78, i am seventy to we all know that being outside in nature is good for kids but for a lot of them it doesn't happen very often many children grow up in a world of television video games and pavement and for them spending quality time outside means a quick recess on an asphalt playground study showed that besides promoting physical and emotional health spending time in the natural world engages children in learning and inspires them to care about the world around them
85.56,114.24, on an island in the pacific northwest near seattle is a leading for point of this kind of outdoor experience a school in the woods called island wood each week over ninety fourth and fifth grades from neighbouring elementary schools spend four days on the two hundred and fifty five acre campus to explore the diverse ecosystem and rediscover their connections to the natural world oftentimes it changes their lives
115.71,126.15, tentative at the centre
126.27,147.21, i hope it will be a good experience for you entomological inanimate and abandoning years old
148.56,158.37, first came here for the first time i didn't know what to expect but this is a really nice size
160.08,164.01, i really like her everybody have some
164.61,167.13, the timanyoni
167.76,179.91, for my maiden
181.83,188.61, at all this comfort into a confession before
188.76,191.4, one arm
191.43,193.17, the book is of
196.83,204.72, to how much more lasting that was a concern for analytic
205.47,250.08, in the morning all the kids but to different things sanitaetsmachine about how a native americans were here on the island and properly in the same spot as
250.83,252.78, and
252.81,271.62, so this is a transmitter we now have six birds that have these translators i think i can don't always have a chance to participate in something real as radiates good on this path i see some of the kids who
271.65,275.97, don't really participate in school very much really participating actively
276.39,279.99, so involved and what's happening and do that hands on learning
280.2,291.99, i think they're finally seeing you know that learning is something more than just work sheets and books it's about exploring about excitement
293.88,299.37, with ratiocination
304.38,306.57, i saw the whole
306.63,314.67, but she was really pleased and with a nice sight i am light the animals the follicles or some
315.57,336.9, an opportunity for them to tell discover with the are to discover where their straighter when they were civitate eyes open as if a valise removed for them to sort of reaction a candidate be this what is exciting for me is that a opportunity like that could change the life of the kids
337.71,347.76, he
347.76,381.84, nature was our first teacher but that lesson has been all but forgotten in our rush to teach test and old students to fit into our current educational system many children have difficulty learning and a tightly structured environment of desks rose and tardy bells but experienced base education programs successfully engaged students with the hands on approach nature becomes a living classroom and educators and naturalists become guides to encourage curiosity exploration and learning
382.14,404.22, he showed that this approach its students excited about learning raises academic test scores and improves concentration and combative development it takes a lot of work but at the core creating inspiration begins to inspiration
404.55,476.61, inspiration really came from the land and seen this beautiful place i woke up on a sunday morning and had a very clear idea of what should be done here we should build a school in the woods where kids could come and learn about the natural and cultural history of petitsou the beginning of the project was really more process about gathering information in the first two years i probably conducted about seventy different focus groups with historians artists the kidnapped center from the ground the next year i spent travelling to twenty five other facilities around the us and found son that were really models for us i tried to take the best from each centralised
476.7,529.35, what we ended up with is truly a world class model both around the design because of the sustainable architectural aspects as well as the curriculum caskets were really are biggest customer we decided to ask them what they thought so the morning what we're looking for help from you all on is how to make that place extra special we into the basin two hundred and fifty children in fourth fifth and sixth grade if they could build a school in the woods what would they want to do when they got there and where would they want to sleep their ideas are really what has created the magic for this place this is really a project that's about community and it's a project that for the community
541.41,556.62, when it children don't have the opportunity to get away from their daily urban lives due to economic challenges and other factors there vision outdoor learning center of mine the first time they actually spend the night in the woods and get their hands in the dirt
556.62,575.28, sometimes a students are surely want to be away from familiar surroundings that something happens after a few days immersed in nature curiosity takes over and learning the comes fun and that's an experience that should be available to all children regardless of their socioeconomic status
575.64,594.06, the kids
594.06,597.51, the first exposure to quit
597.51,607.92, and environmental situation like force and i never experienced anything like our however till topside
607.92,619.26, i like there is like fresh air like a lot of forest on very cold
619.32,630.33, the californian the ricara the evil that we saw estortuaire the purloining
630.57,634.86, i saw animals that wouldn't see in the daytime like owls
635.52,637.44, he saw 
637.89,639.06, the fine
640.08,646.05, the frog that was fun i can hear
646.29,652.26, though the wildness you can really hear the the environment
652.26,669.18, i heard those salons at my house before i learned about freestones and arsenicated i untied how he went to the art too and did some hard
669.6,707.34, what we call participatory learning is particularly useful because gideon more way of mending that knowledge in your brain as olorun when you do something you remember it the best way to know if you know something is to teach it and the children in fact or learning and antechamber i was it yesterday did you give very well easter way of looking at the world in order the world is not all cars and black top and told buildings and houses and people now alike to live somewhere hair
707.64,708.81, it
709.05,713.4, really when out in the woods like this for a long time so it's real different for me
713.67,719.25, in their front save by a silly things and
719.46,722.67, as carousing
722.67,726.81, in sixteen interesting things
727.02,728.04, well 
728.1,745.53, makes me feel open like thing free or i am a college so i really want to come back here and teach you can inspire one can to treat the old outweighed grows up what will they do with her life and what will they do for the world
745.71,748.68, he
748.89,751.86, he
759.78,793.17, when children are outdoors they become aware of their connection to nature and better understand the importance of protecting it global climate change shows that our actions can have enormous effect on the future of this planet it's important for us to work together using fewer natural resources in what we do and what we build here an island would all the buildings were designed from the ground up to use almost thirty per cent less energy and water than traditional structures and the buildings weren't just designed for shelter they were designed to teach as well
794.07,913.47, began the project one of the ideas was to use architecture as education so that the buildings did more than contained programs or old people but they were an opportunity to help teach about sustain ability about the world thessalonica home and others retorted wind moves learn how to sun moves and learned how to be better stewardson were banfleet they used me above of the bamboo grows faster were closing in about the building the watson the country to the matabele yogurt containers and listened were integrated for example one idea was the floating class room they wanted to be able to pull themselves out into the corinthians rather tree houses the children ideas are probably created the greatest piece of the matterhorn
913.92,942.57, all the environmental aspects of this blatantly used to compositors in the insertion and notice access to it but the kids be able to see where the waste is going and the old understand how that process is working hyphenation
942.63,961.17, the waste water living chinese able to walk through and see that process happening in aniething was she is pretty cabecas in hopes of durward clean again
962.01,981.36, we really hope that the kids take away and understanding that although they may live in the urban world that the natural world plays a very important part in sustaining the relive and their family and communities life infinitely going titillations water a bubbly recitor not waste
981.69,990.78, i like going on the suspension bridge because i must get of his and i face my fears
991.47,1000.53, he
1001.13,1013.61, for these students getting out doors may increase personal growth and confidence but it doesn't end there bagosh teachers reinforce and continue the experience
1013.94,1021.44, students the new anacreon and awareness is a seed carried into their homes to develop and grow
1022.07,1058.94, my name is joe patrick and i am an i went ridden i as walking down the strand looking out for some little creature but i my ponderous to make connections with a lot of students and to aspire stirabout and they can difference in their communities share their knowledge and their excitement about earning with other people and the spread that it that fire cannot witanagemot
1059.18,1071.87, they can really make a difference it's really up to them one cooperatively gather and made picketed of stewardship
1071.9,1120.08, back to their schools now there in the correct amount of pieces in here so that every one will be able to build the bird houses there's no left overs the students really have taken an interest in birds especially from trying to follow grace the owl round island wood and i think it's going to be a very important thing to have these bird houses out around the school so we can make it a little bit more of a natural habitat to the holy man with sad is going to go to the land which bidiane classroom is working with a garden at eradicate
1120.2,1152.69, looking at ways they can go into that garden and bring some of the knowledge that they had formed to investigating the natural world of violent woods back to the natural world the balalaiki coming through here is
1152.69,1166.25, then to have fun and to be awakened or hope is that through those kinds of experiences that children will become good stories of
1166.61,1169.16, communities and their environments
1169.55,1184.79, one of the things we do in a garden is we motorboats we put things over the top of them because rain can wash the soil away we studied and of water in the classroom and we done numerous experiments
1184.82,1187.43, the reason they didn't connect
1187.52,1190.13, as they realized that
1190.13,1204.41, to do it plants and soil sliding i think it somehow made more sense to them and your man getting in the class we don't get thirty and i'll hear we do
1205.88,1222.38, are one part of ireland with a definitely can transplant back to your home community because everybody can have a garden whether it's in a pot whether it's at your school it's at your home or is in a community garden so it's an exciting possibility for children
1225.8,1250.64, a matter colonization an astute learner we deal with that by having a quite a bit activities always doing some sort of hands on activity whether it be in math or science just to get them up and moving around so the garden gray leadenfield
1251.09,1252.8, learning
1253.07,1266.03, it makes me feel have been more adventurous more learning
1266.39,1284.78, i wanted to do a garden so we wouldn't have to go to a grocery store by the things we like and i thought it would be better to have a garden and a park yard for me and my family
1285.44,1303.02, when we garinter were able to have a ticonderago sometimes being quiet and calm and bring up that moment of asking questions and sometimes they are afraid to ask
1303.02,1305.72, maybe embarrass
1306.29,1322.31, to be best friend and i think gardening start me how will my dad fell in case i haven't been with him for a while because he works late and i learned more about it
1322.31,1324.35, i would like to be like him
1324.56,1330.17, cause he's a funnel i want to be a finality
1330.44,1335.03, when we are little kids we want to be like or that
1335.36,1339.8, sometimes when we are older than we see kids
1339.8,1346.91, we want to be like them thank you 
1348.29,1350.72, the
1351.41,1373.76, if a small thing like a garden can make such a huge difference imagine world were children everywhere have the experience of spending time outdoors the opportunity to use nature as a classroom exists no matter where you live so go ahead turn off the tavy get off the couch and discovered the immense education that exists beyond your front door
