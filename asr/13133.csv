0.09,32.07, i am madam sanders spirting acclaiming deer when telaba the brevitie burgos actually designed to be used what i mean by that most of ices are commented graverow this device is his in the catch a climber we actually have a thin ergonomic on the project from day one for both the usage method and the geometry of the device itself he really focused on how people interact with these devices and how that affects their performance in real life
32.16,61.8, most pleasantly to use this device is the safest way you're not tempted to make these exceptions and overrides and stuff like that and worksheet of rope sizes super smooth lowering it resolved and was grand the burgos targeted at climbers of all ability and variety of styles so indoor outdoor adoratorios slide back through
63.0,68.04, captures every inch that comes through it also really easy to lower someone in that position
69.33,70.47, the
72.12,74.79, open the face plate swing the handle out of the way
76.56,77.22, he
77.76,88.14, the elocution to see this i can easily left a terminus which way to alpine earnest so it's actually opposite of how like a dried be clipped on
88.53,92.85, that the heroine of the climber actually comes out from the bottom of device
92.94,94.26, then you're going to hold it
94.41,108.78, like so we do that for two reasons one it makes this position i feel really naturally actually feeding horizontally primarily and then also with this added twist in it it's actually more likely in spite of not paying attention just pulled out of your hands and lock up
108.96,111.33, do we want to provide a safe way
111.36,118.56, for the bear to touch the device where they not actually overriding em but they knew they are they are in contact with it as people are always going to want to touch these devices
118.56,131.64, so he says thumb here and the nice thumbprint right there make early clear and then your index finger plays in this comfortable groove right here savour back three fingers on the rope so in this position you can see this appear that your some lays on
131.76,134.82, mounted through this hole so
134.88,137.67, the front plate to move independently
137.67,142.08, even if you squeeze that really hard i can still move and lock up
142.38,164.91, also the handles mounted to the back plate to provide some extra safety if someone is using incorrectly and there put their hands over it or their touching it in some odd way it shields the ability of those two plates to me relative to each other and hesitates to override but we tried to shrouded against most of the casual common ways epithet
164.94,169.5, then to feed slack you feed or only like so take it back in
169.86,176.73, nice things about it being so tacked isle is that when you take in slack like so the clip the bull and the top roping like two feet
176.76,183.12, when in that process yet takes like back in removing your hand from advice and you can come right back to ever looking at the device
183.36,185.34, i confirm you in the right spot
185.76,204.9, then if you do sure of your body i got you off guard to momentarily disengage it you just put your palm on the little fin but your fingers on the rope close your grip and now it's wide open you can feed to him do that wintertime today sure open collar nay for slack all there lingers on the rope close your hip tee the slack
204.96,214.47, even if they fall in your right ear your holding the rope that goes to the climber and so a poseur it there and lock up again sereno actually overriding it your dismount arily disengaged
214.56,223.62, the huge benefits of their guessed out the clip and use up to an hour feeling bad and you have to get it to him quickly then if they do blow it you're not holding it open
223.89,229.83, lowering his super simple straight forward i'm taking my hand off the break and right now to pull here but
229.83,234.72, realize went to your going averting our hand or on like so
234.84,236.85, materially smoothly
237.36,239.76, and it's very easy to control lower and his vice
