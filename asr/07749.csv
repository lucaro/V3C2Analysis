0.12,103.62, as we move forward and continue to integrate mobile devices and computer systems into our lives were more and more often using them to control our lives into her was to take action in the world to cause things to happen and as we do that we want to make sure that it's really austin it's not some ackerson were doing it on our behalf there's a bunch of sensitive data that we receive that should be secure a credit card information are bank information blood test doctors results publics are a little harder to trust that sort of our classic computer system we always use it for everything in our lives were always downloading as without even reading what they do or what the terms of service are said who knows what software is actually getting down loaded to the fonsegue problem of people being very open with their foes in terms of what they downloading in everywhere which is obviously a problem if there's someone bad looking about one example of that is your doing some banking and your transferring two hundred dollars to your friends to cover some theatre or some concert you want to well what if there's malarono a couple digested now your transferring twenty thousand dollars to the hackeries can you be sure you can trust him oblivious words is that it forms the basis of an argument emanates on that evidence we can create a chain of arguments that the software is running in a good state as well the care of a mobile rotors in usually just something that tells you what you booted when the mobile phones started someone powers on what it had done and usually he tells you what is the operating system that's running and how is the very early configuration of it done

125.85,205.38, so mobile roots of trust are being used right now because for the most part that they don't exist and they don't exist because of this interesting chicken in april no one is willing to invest in in technology until there are applications that use that technology of course no one was to write an application for a technology that doesn't fit our goal with all this work is to stimulate investment on both sides of this question so we have been doing some work both on the how do we create alert of trust and put them on phones that are on the market now as well as the how do we develop applications that use rich of trust that provide some compelling teachers moods have trust bring benefit in any place where you want to prove that you are you or that your phone is in a good state for they could be medical records and getting into your house getting into your car anywhere where you want to make sure that only you can perform this seaton so the future for all this work is a future where any apparve that its running correctly no matter what and what that does is alleviate a lot of security concerns there's a lot of technology futures that we see in science fiction a television where that negotiates really cool but of course if an attack or did that then that would be bad tolerates allows to start moving towards a future without having to worry about the attack again
