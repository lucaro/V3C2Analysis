107.79,115.23, you know it's interesting i spent a lot of time in december especially to reflecting on the air and
115.53,118.29, it was really an amazing it was
119.58,130.59, and a little bit of a world when that times to be honest who was i think the learning here was probably a little bit more than i anticipated just getting my head around a lot of regional and state
130.71,139.44, even in federal issues that you know as commissioner you just not as engaged in there's a lot of things that i think a lot of people didn't realize
139.53,155.16, he was involved in i didn't realize and so is not a lot of my time last year learning developing relationships meeting with other mayors just better understanding all of the different facets of the position
155.31,196.89, and then it's a lot of learning like it a lot of first you know everything was a first for me so it was a great year but it was incredibly busy year and so it was nice to pause and to cumberland retaliate you want your undertaking forward this year and i spending about priorities for the share what we did well last year while we can get better so expensive meat
197.01,255.21, were invited the way in on what now is the new master plan for the parks and recreation after several months of taking city citizen and put us well as working on that telleth new master plantation thanks for bringing that of this this significant a move forward so as as we talked about the past ubanarama ter plan is required we have to do that every five years i if we want oliver and denotes on dollars sweet to the overtone to take a deep dive into our parts and come up with a updated comprehensiveness plant so the master planets is out on the website you can take a look at it their hard copies at libraries at the city of fanatical at the hard top it's about two hundred pages so it's a lengthy document but it's really two
255.42,279.03, more information added and a little more detail so i have a list of things i would like to see added to the document including just better maps trilling down into pacific neighborhood areas that need transcends but were in the thiergarten that's coming up
279.27,361.89, and then we'll continue to take public comment will take those comments and go back and make some provisions to the document before it brought back to the fulkhisian predation i so please take a look at that has a lot of information about about our vision for all our parks but also it has information about the vision to connecticut's walking distance so we were looking at is there save a cross wax said it has a nice holistic approach and then it's looking at opportunities for parks so how can we think differently about parks and how do we sustain parks so towards the back of the document is a list of ideas that will hopefully spent some time talking about so how do we look at additional revenue streams for parksides of ideas of last chapter of the document so hopefully people have a chance to look at that and give us feed back before we analysis you did take a lot of public import before the dead city commission really worked hard on receiving some input from siskiyou mentioned a number of features of the rain there how much of that came from
361.98,378.51, in a quite a bit there's a section that talks about how we view parks and as we look to redesign parks for our eelements and then it gives examples of specific parks in neighborhoods what they look like now and what potentially they can look like in the future
378.51,387.27, and i believe the bulk of that he became from the contingent form that were slated by the by let consultant
387.36,403.59, he said the bedtime is still open so adonais that received how is that happened i see to do and mostaganem you and call you can show up at the public hearing you know there's all any of those ways you know whatever easiest for you don't 
403.71,443.19, right o singers there some new additions also you mentioned to me before when on a idiots but there's some morning ordnance amendments in the works what there are there are so and so these are also available on line and you can actually see the red line version of the oneness i know it's also in the planning department page i can take a look at those we also have a public hearing for those coming up on the fourteenth and a lot of the recommendations are around recommendations that came on of the garford plan of recommendations lehigh and density mixed use
443.52,455.31, especially in the area that's part of the dear foreign plan which is largely downtown area but then there's some other recommendations to that the planning commission reviewed
455.34,463.77, it's another lengthy document unfortunately but you can see the red line version line and then you can give us some feedback on that as well
464.19,475.71, for feedback and that makes me think i thereaway for citizens to sign up for maybe notices whenever there are public hearings in addition to the regular commission meetings and the committee meetings and all those sorts of things
475.77,486.39, you know that's a great question i know that we do that for certain services and then i know that you can get on a list if you want to look at
486.42,488.94, commission agenda
488.97,491.19, and these agents
491.49,497.28, that's a great idea and i know it's good timing were the process right now of obtainest
497.37,499.35, so we
499.38,528.6, halesus eben in december we approved an agreement with open cities and where the process ragtown the website to make it more customer driven user friendly easy to navigate and so we have a team in town this week actually working on the website with us aleatory inessential be a part of a news
529.8,532.11, you know that's a great suggestion
532.77,598.23, no question for you and just something that's going on with city commission and that's bistre a new plan adopted there and what's new in that so that's another pretty comprehensive plan we did adopt that you'll find a lot of things intercommunication so and you can find the list on the cities sit too and actually was just printed in the we are greensheve it that at your house i believe towards the back of the of the addition you'll see a list of all the streets that are slated for street construction or straight work this summer so you'll see this construction season all of the streets but that's on our website as well and it's a leviathan streets of a number of years on black offending and that was a very deliberate plan of mothers
598.74,609.84, a kind of the big take away that i got out of that is when you let them deteriorate a cost exponentially more to get him up to where they should be and then keep the maintenance there
610.2,644.19, what kind of funding you know there was a big concern a few years ago that it was state money that used to help what this alinement away house it being funded now so it still is a net so we still get we still get transportation dollars from the state and that goes through one they have been cut over time but the significant local funds come from the extension of our income tax nodded
644.34,654.12, a locally dedicated to streets and then as i said we do get we do get funds from the state were hoping that that goes up a little bit this year
654.12,671.64, the gas tax increase was that part of the text commitment to pass that along his cities the portion of it to a lot of go to and died and two you know other projects that are already kind of on the books but we're going into we're just getting started with our budget
671.64,677.49, budget discussions and we'll have a full analysis of that going into
677.49,746.88, this current budget and hopefully starting to light one okay and then one back on one little bit but when you mention the part she said there are some state money available there if you follow certain criteria whatso that work is so there's the indian arrestin grant which is a grant at the same level and we every year we submit grandfathers are inhabitant has to be lined with that master plan i'm so waves emitted we've omitted and in our trust funds in the past even in the past couple of years to help us with funding larger park project so or working right now on replacing the upraised some envy in our trustworthiness well over a million dollars i believe we go like the understanding or trust on gropper along the river on weyerhouser
747.09,756.69, so that was even amillion dollars of indian or trust in grant so at a state grant but you have to have your parks master plan
756.75,777.72, in alignment and it has to be approved and ask the updated so that's why it's really important because it enables us to apply for some of those funds but there's always there's always a local match with mantras dollars so the nice thing is that we've had the park mill age would dedicate dollars for capital improvement and we've been able to use
777.72,784.26, and from the parks mileage to leverage some of these anderson applications
784.44,785.97, well just 
786.36,844.92, then you had already brought up that budget season starts very early for the city is a budget that begins in july but there's a lot of publications associated with that even after the city commission is working pretty diligently on that taste city manager provided you with the temple of anything like that or how what is the process that's a good question so we are in conversations right now about the budget and every department head or on their own individual department budget and then that's reviewed with the sitting manager in the so they do a lot of behind the scenes work before the final budget is prevented pretentiousness
845.01,849.54, starting right after spring break in april the city commission will meet every single week
849.75,863.19, for two to five hours a week and that goes all the way through to minden we vote on the budget and then it's through it's usually by nightly process or we meet every week we review sections of the budget
863.22,877.23, within that time frame we have public hearings so we have public hearings on and he sees that our proposed by actual budget we provide ample time for people to provide in but before we end up voting
877.32,885.78, have to have to vote on a budget by the end of june and it has to be a balanced budget and coats under state laws or required
885.78,931.02, so a long process there it is it is a long process but it's you know i've gone through this process in number of times lately first time as mayor and then it was late was interesting because not only was it my first time as mayor but transition over to a new financial management system the budget that was presented d'lisleville
931.05,940.23, liberal take a break now and marbles be busting with james here's public services director rat after this will be back

1128.6,1154.25, married never looked back he stayed on the side of the stage as this is a very nice place to live in so so i know when i first started as commissioner you were in charge of conform so i worked pretty closely with you then and then you moved into public works and that department has changed a little bit over time but why don't you share a little bit about you what you currently oversee your
1154.4,1163.34, services we do basically to major functions all solid waste management in the city so we do all the refuse and recycling and you're always collections
1163.67,1171.59, then we have street menace which encompasses a whole lot of things one being you know winter operations we do all the snow blowing
1171.59,1187.76, take care of all the salting of the streets we street sweep we patched the pot holes which is where you get some complaints we do paving we do graphically anything that's within the road right away that needs maintenance department i care that
1187.76,1208.34, and side walks we don't desertion but engineering manages the sidewalks as far as making sure they're fixed in good shape to tell us about some of the things happening in the city and the party well we back up people further oka always like out old was sitting grandison solway for over a hundred years
1208.7,1217.7, back in the day you know we would have horse and buggy going down the street picking up leaves mary may not even know this but we have a service up until the ties
1217.82,1231.68, we would go in the back door of homes and pick up trash right in the back yard at through the red gardiner house so lot of exciting things happening right apartment a lot of changes happen i started in department in 
1231.77,1236.18, at that time we rolled a single string recycling which was a great hit
1236.51,1243.65, we're up to be customers that are using our services for recycling or tonnage has
1243.65,1252.14, through the roof as you know i preach that issue in the lot on the recycling side again we rolled out last year sorting stations
1252.17,1255.62, and i know there's a graphic that we provided on the salting stations
1255.71,1259.67, and that was meant to educate people special men
1259.67,1266.69, we wanted to really get into the business of educating folks who visit our downtown or other areas of our city about recycling
1266.72,1272.45, and we provided these stations in regrets they hold in six carolinas
1272.54,1282.56, really top people what's art to put the right thing in an it was interesting we did sort of some observations or in our prize and it was very interesting to see how people responded
1282.92,1287.09, so we're rolling that out for all special events were getting a lot of requested
1287.09,1288.38, crispations
1288.56,1322.43, work cited to offer that as a service we are even looking at doing dusters for special events so something that were kind of expanding some of our service that we do providential about this a little bit but were always concerned when recycling beaconing because contamination how we doing on that and you know what you want to make sure that residents know allan to make sure that our residence understand is that the nothink about before they put it into that container
1322.82,1329.12, cycling we did have an optic of contamination and whether that be putting trash in the recycling container
1329.21,1335.93, a dog faces have been put in the clothes i mean i know close commerce but it's not that's not the right way to do it
1336.02,1340.64, we were running both percent contamination last year
1340.64,1342.05, so educating
1342.32,1351.11, we did some sampling on certain streets we put our flyers to help educate folks and what to do and if we find that your contaminating
1351.14,1354.86, the card from the house because it does cost us money
1354.95,1357.11, does contaminate the whole lot
1357.29,1365.96, we're getting better were continuing to educate and that's part of what the starting stations were about was getting people educated in what they put in the right container and i think it's working
1365.99,1377.03, thank you for your work on that i know weakened with us as we did that as well yeah it was a great great collaboration between we met an county department of public works are prized
1377.06,1389.93, and i mean the man shaded help us well we did a number of things there you know worked out roderic so i know it's not that time of year but i know universally hard on the
1389.93,1405.32, leaves and drop off your oversight and i know we get lots of questions about you inassailable bit about that well your waste cosden around for over a hundred years we do curb cycle now we use carts and bags
1405.38,1412.25, we do get a fair amount of waves in the street and our fall streets weeping is pretty much a life clean up program
1412.37,1415.37, treat southworth
1415.43,1419.9, continues to grow with volume people have learned that it's there
1419.93,1423.89, it's no charge to residents it's part of their taxes and their paying
1424.07,1428.12, so we are looking at ways of how do we manage that waste how do we manage
1428.15,1444.98, do something with that compost if we're going to do something with it so the sorting stations did provide a composing banister educating folks in composing and one of our transformation goals as to look at having curbside composing a knowles something un i've dacoit's a gold of mine
1445.04,1451.01, and just how do we roll that out i think we're a little bit maybe another year or so before we can really work hard on that
1451.22,1456.8, but this is the vine continues to grow and donate need to look at how do we use the material
1456.83,1470.42, make it but even make it available to our residence well that's exciting i could courtoisie and we did we did a year and a half ago we allowed backyard composting an appropriate
1471.08,1475.19, but i know we still give a latter request for
1475.22,1482.33, as well as where can they go to get composer getting it more and more from special tenanting to do composting
1482.69,1494.51, you know there is a number of events in the city now that are cerastes and they know how to do it and they're doing it well one of the stables is there's not a lot of locations in the west michigan area where you can take count
1494.54,1512.06, that's not a thing that we're kind of looking at an exciting as exciting as anything else about refuser want to talk about our pastor grayson grantorto program back in twenty twelve it was designed to give residence of option
1512.24,1515.57, he control their cost for their trash service
1515.63,1517.34, courage more recycling
1517.58,1524.51, accounts you know we've had some challenges along the way but i think it's working really well a lot of residents i hear from
1524.51,1530.99, about how much they appreciate it if they're gone they don't worry about their bill not getting paid or the trash again picked up
1531.05,1539.63, they're there and they put it out and gets picked up if they don't want to use it that week they don't have to pay for service that week so it's pretty simple
1539.99,1554.15, and helps encourage recycling and you picked a size cart you need that fits your family's needs and you know you only pay for service when you need it all counts its going well we're still looking at a couple of things here and there for a improving in enhancing the service
1554.27,1578.06, but as you know mayor is one of the most unique programs in the country and i get calls about it people want to know how it's working so and you know speaking of that we should touch on with recycling my dear city points ysobel have that program williston sign up and every time not yerece you can earn points of donnegan go on line and you can treat in those points for coupons to use at a local establishment which do
1578.09,1585.02, it continued to expand yes you know we have other sterile now with getting people signed up in offering rewards
1585.2,1597.2, i think that with the future that is going to grow but yeah i started out with recycling and a lot of people use it as really properly program here
1597.35,1606.56, what else is on your last want to share with us a couple of things i just want to mention about cats you know you talk about contamination i also want to mention or remind our resident 
1606.74,1612.77, a story your card of the street i get complaints about this and certain neighborhoods or people just don't move their carts

1965.63,1970.25, to actually start to see the revenue to be where we thought would have been

2001.06,2006.19, averaging right now but every other week to belper cent of the time that people put their cards

2018.46,2024.88, interesting about them because i just assumed that that man you everybody was being built at the same rate there would be 
2024.88,2031.39, a little bit less income but possibly than maybe less drivers or something like that i didn't know maybe
2031.42,2037.12, drivers reduced trucks we went to an automated a system on our trucks
2037.33,2043.42, the persistent was the guy who get in and out of the truck five six hundred times a day throwing bags

2059.98,2063.16, and in our ethnology i know had a graphic but they don't
2063.22,2068.53, explain that so explanatory card is often
2068.62,2070.3, when the track pulls up
2070.3,2071.98, connection read the card
2072.49,2080.2, now if you have money on your account and now as at the rate address and if it does i can to your cart in the suite
2080.2,2081.91, deduct from your account
2082.51,2089.59, a prepaid system and then when you tip it in deduction your count so we have three sides and three different prices
2089.59,2099.31, he does that same or the tag system then do them my point when its recycling that's by way as that right as yet
2099.34,2104.41, rest when there was first a talk of the transition to the type of recycling
2104.59,2118.54, service that the city was going to do there was a lot of criticism of the single stream recycling and just wondered how you know living in a few years now would have we learn what do we know about that i think the contamination was the issue or maybe it was the labor that would take to
2121.27,2127.0, you can must be to i can speak to it something i been watching very closely for five years
2127.18,2131.47, across the country single stream facilities have had some struggles
2131.53,2133.24, some have closed down
2133.54,2137.77, but in this community it made it a lot easier for residents to recycled
2137.86,2140.65, we have some contamination
2142.06,2147.04, large i think it's a better system that we had before because he had to get all you separate it
2147.16,2149.14, dramatically
2149.44,2154.21, almost the same number of customers at the beginning he was just easier for people to recycled
2154.21,2160.03, put all on container and i from the processing stateside of it he adheres more cost involved
2160.06,2164.35, some labor on the belt when they are starting the material
2164.47,2168.25, satiated but some of it still labor intensive
2168.52,2176.8, but i sees me working but even in the whole so having been at the city when we converted
2176.89,2204.52, remember those blue toga lot of people had trouble especially elderly we got a lot of cervantes for people who had a hard time getting out to the curb but then also for our drivers they had the same thing mangeot pick it up unpainted you now put it in the right place and then even at the old facility there are still people working on the line sorting organizing things there and so 
2204.55,2209.35, the numbers in regards to how many many hours
2209.5,2216.73, hours it take a victor at liberation but i do know that 
2216.73,2235.6, spent quite a bit of time looking at that and the county has been a great partner in this and they spent a lot of time analyzing what it would take to convert over and and we did see a dramatist even without the migrations just with the conversion to single shallow pretty significant optician
2235.63,2242.95, contrapuntists faster so they can process more material
2243.04,2244.66, quickly 
2244.66,2247.69, the old system was more labor intensive it was slower
2247.81,2252.04, they had to separate everything out now it's just comes on the belt asometon
2252.04,2269.38, then it's just pick right out and the trough but i understand as much higher than what it was before have you been to the facility you know when i was unveiled buonaparte should jackechan that's a great thing to that can't counsel the time have
2269.38,2282.73, through a most students but then also just communing groups who want to learn what happens to their recycling and how it sorted and so it's ungain really get a good look at the entire process and it's absolutely fascinating
2282.79,2296.74, and it's a public public assets so i always encourage individuals who go and take a look at its great they do a fair number of tours a year yes lookin fourth graders the graders something like that
2296.74,2309.76, education center in the building and i would encourage you to which i got out pushing be contacted the if they wanted to whose lead personal heroics weasels person
2309.94,2314.56, i was here with her can obviously call the director to abase
2314.68,2337.36, and i was interested that that's where start the artisan they they accept other types of products that can be recycled so they do batteries they do outers as their ways pantasote county you know for something that isn't appropriate for a single stream if you have something that you want recycled you can always call a county 
2338.08,2358.06, we do have a question and this relates to this neighborhood and i says it's from carol it says the week of november committee medcenter are building a front here we share with library the bends were set on fire and burned so plainly that the remains of a benzoated into the sidewalk and it will be actually reported that to the city we were told that the refuse
2358.06,2373.39, as in the neighborhood that particular night just wanted if you know anything about were venders caught does this happen off and what's all about really tells botheration
2373.93,2375.43, i imagine
2375.79,2377.29, that's not a good thing
2377.62,2379.39, we do replace those
2379.72,2382.18, so i be happy to look into a further
2382.54,2385.51, with this particular neighborhood as far as what happened
2385.84,2389.8, after the election he was november
2390.28,2392.2, that unfortunate
2392.26,2395.89, petition on the follow to that sure
2396.4,2410.35, to know that we will place the sofy do have it that's roamed in some way just call the city and colorless the other question relates to
2411.37,2412.24, i
2412.36,2451.6, this one for after you and just for the mayor but i have a few more questions of a timely mentioned feeding you my department handles fidgeted so there was a crafty task force and i don't know that includes citizen as that kind of help a dress this but how how is that i look at the west side and that's what most familiar with i'm here and seemed to be slightly less i hate to speak that allowance the course of that but how is that kind of abatement going i would recompense areas that tend to get more apothanontes and we will visit those on a regular basis to try to be creative we know that fitts not
2451.66,2455.8, ted in a reasonable amount of time it comes to grow fast
2455.92,2466.12, we have some act of neighborhoods who will call us and let us know there's good you know we've got some tunnels particularly on the side of the city that tend to be a magnet for a
2466.3,2468.7, those quite often throughout the year
2469.99,2474.52, a really good about keeping us in formed and our guys get out there and take care of it
2475.0,2483.49, we take care of escapable areas babiole's will do them back some grades of proprietors as long as they give us a release
2483.49,2484.93, fences
2484.99,2489.46, particularly if it's a vulgar i don't want to get that off of the summer's possible
2490.93,2492.31, i agree with you i think
2492.37,2496.3, i'm seeing what i've been hearing is the number of art
2496.51,2571.54, issues in the city are down allthing one is we have a gold to get to the immediate soon as we find out about it harland have areithous contortionistic that's what i do i do theoretically as we know about it will get out the other thing that i've noticed and i really appreciated exhortations but you'll see a lot more misere starting to see utility boxes that are painted with a word or seen farmers and parts i and onela walls that in the past often got tagged and we know that merlatter don't tend again tag with graffiti and they also add so much to you know a neighborhood or an area just adding art and so that's been nice as we see
2571.6,2582.67, i think we see less criticise re seeing more of these spaces these canvases as i call them filled with art to take it there's a process to
2582.91,2592.93, martha would the city do say something official didn't happen but was more than taking it was really actually part
2594.43,2611.05, a good question i mean typically we can tell the difference pretty quickly the projects with the utility boxes are usually organized with the city and the neighbor associations recommendation is what if someone just pull on up
2611.17,2613.09, we would look at it and see
2613.6,2621.73, mary the committee after i think we may have looked at a couple of those in the past and you know and i met certain criteria and is not offensive i think we would
2621.79,2622.72, it
2623.59,2634.27, let no one bring up as you mentioned something jupitiere but straightening and no street cleaning but it was the snow removal and the salt now there's 
2634.42,2644.65, something liquid is it less corrosive or is it just morelove enhances the salt that we put down the street and it makes it activate faster
2644.77,2653.53, our goal is to get that street is in the best seats we can for the traveling public so that a safe that they're not slipping than i causing accidents
2653.65,2658.63, it's a product and it's becoming pretty well known in the country
2658.93,2661.6, you get the salt wet before it hits the ground
2661.6,2665.65, you sprang it will recall the spanner on the back of the truck and you see the spinner
2665.71,2669.19, i shedn't get it wet it comes off dry
2669.37,2674.53, they have what they call a bounce and scatter effective to ground rolls into the curve
2674.59,2680.26, you don't want that you want to in the middle o the road where you want to place it down so what's wet it sticks faster
2680.38,2682.15, it faster
2682.48,2684.7, useless all
2684.91,2688.09, our goal is to be environmentally sensitive
2688.15,2692.05, to try to save money and to try to use the best technologies we have available
2692.35,2695.83, we have seen we put wing clowes on our trucks now too so we can do like
2696.13,2697.6, one half was
2697.63,2719.86, overmuch more efficient and in getting the streets cleared up a song is the casino the land is a curious weaving of the sacking tallantire tor of public services to partment thank you again for joining in kingston
2720.25,2723.76, we'll take a break will be back with a small questions after this
2724.51,2743.8, hello i am adamant i'm a community organizer at disability advocates of kent county
2744.46,2758.41, organization work to create and accessible and welcoming community for all anticipate individuals with the disabilities and living full and exciting lives
2758.8,2765.64, we offered twelve different programs which focused on housing government changes
2765.7,2770.68, education and employment for individuals with the disabilities
2771.04,2774.1, a focus on independent living
2774.64,2786.22, a part of being able to live independently as being able to leave your home for individuals with disabilities and older adults
2786.34,2791.35, and i can make a difficult to maneuver throughout our community
2791.5,2795.52, and sometimes even prevent people from leaving their homes
2795.64,2801.73, therefore we are working to get the word out about the importance of snow removal
2802.84,2809.71, of grand rapids does not provide snow removal services for dry ways or sidewalks
2810.4,2828.73, clearing of snow and ice on the sidewalk is the responsibility of the property owner the full width of the sidewalk should be cleared within twenty four hours of the accumulation or placement of snow or ice
2828.85,2838.78, grand rapids city ordinance requires that sidewalk be completely cleared of all snow and ice down to the concrete
2839.35,2844.6, when you are selling your sidewalk don't forget to shovel the curb cut
2844.6,2855.79, while the city trucks plow the road the snow and ice between the sidewalk and the road can build up an stop a person in their tracks
2856.45,2876.91, you have questions or neith help some suggestions are you united way at two one one american red cross an ter neighbourhood association also resources such as your local church private contractor nabor or family member could be of assistance as well
2877.06,2885.58, clearing snow from fire hydrants sidewalks but stops and touch faces benefits every one
2885.94,2888.64, have her community
2924.67,2971.65, welcome back to city connection february edition of city connection in when the glass he with mere roslin bliss and were to part where we take your questions and we got few in the cue so may well go at ome group on a little bit we have a couple of related to housing soul start with this one and it says as the city considered implementing a community land trust in partnership with community organizations such as tolford workforce housing but what be pronandos sort of thing here in grand rapids so that a great question it is something that we have talked about i wouldn't say that were actively looking at doing that right now a couple thistles
2972.22,2993.85, i longer conversation you know it's really the waiters and access to affordable housing were having an influx of people who want to live here where having developed it developments in neighborhoods it's kind of a mix of a number
2994.36,2998.02, real complex problem where in today
2998.02,3003.21, so different than where we were eight years ago i mean it's just now i remember when i was a commissioner
3003.24,3007.41, we were scrambling fear allied to prevent 
3007.44,3016.56, families from the you know push out of their home and foreclosure i mean we're putting money in the foreclosure response and prevention and now it's
3016.62,3037.05, to get her head round what we can do as a city was in our authority to really push affordable housing so we have we have had some conversations about falterest there isn't anything actively that's being looked at outreachings
3037.08,3053.31, a commission we created an affordable housing trust fund so that was put in place in july of last year where the city put money into the affordable housing trust fund started to identify revenue streams were looking at taking a percentage of every market rate
3053.4,3084.15, development and putting that into the affordable housing trust fund so we're looking options but we haven't finalized anything yet to continue to put money in the fordable housing trust fund and they were looking at how the funds from the affordable housing trust fund can be used to have the greatest impact on afforded the housing advisory committee so it's a group of about twenty five people
3084.33,3124.11, i appointed them back in a patera few months ago they've met four times now and there looking at two things one is how do we use the affordable housing trust fund overseas it what's the eligibility and then what are other policy changes that we need to make to try to incontinence affordable housing as quickly as possible so my hope is that that many wraps up their recommendations by may and make him incorporated into our into our budget process so it's a long answer community landrost is a part of that discussion but there's a whole host of other things that were looking at right now in addition to that
3124.11,3164.58, well this one is a little bit in a similar vein but this has to do with housing here on the west side it says in the past misbehave praised rockford construction for offering affordable housing on the west side it all the already built housing developments are market rates such as pollinate hundred dollars for a one bedroom apartment new development on stocking has a small number of stasie for a horrible housing and rather constructions none no additional plans for affordable housing in the continuing with the overall development approach this is what many would call deppitation and the question is basically does the city have a plan for combining
3164.58,3207.99, from combating this from looking at this or bringing more of that in here as far as affordable house you know it's a good question and that's the struggle is the how do we highly find this mix of affability to the recent project has societies betweenwhiles that project and then there have been a couple of projects where you know the smaller part you know for
3208.26,3229.05, developers including rockford the building smaller units to try to stay within that price point that's not that were for some people who are single you know and can live in a smaller space and afford it but it's not what families and i am concerned about families and making sure that families have in afford place
3229.14,3240.99, for place that they can live especially right here on the west side so that they can have access to the challenge scholars so that's a significant concern to me what the city can do you 
3241.11,3244.02, for developers
3244.05,3251.61, understate have limitations of what we can do and can't do so right now in our state
3251.7,3272.64, we can't pass it inclusion or housing rule that's not allowed under state law we can't do rencontra it's not allowed under state law so we're looking out what can we do what do we have the authority to do and that's what we're looking at right now both as a full commission but also as a part of the housing advisory committee and there are some options we
3273.0,3274.83, we have some
3274.89,3281.28, i own property so just last week we put on our for the tone market site
3281.28,3325.38, and a parcel and on the river and because the city owns it we can be a part of requiring what needs to be included in the proposed project and we will be saying it's that new be mixing come mixed housing a fort as it will have to have a portable units they'll have to green space it'll have to have access to the river you'll have to have a green infrastructure so there are parcels around the city that the that we amateur public and as we all dose we can put in a purchase agreement or weaken be really thoughtful about how that property is developed to ensure that there is mixed income housing within that project a line for the one 
3325.38,3351.3, to a three minute so i would run through a bunch of question kaiserswerth was formally says that as department heads set their budgets what directives are given by the city council for instance are they required to reduce cost or increase fishes in their departments winstanley
3351.33,3408.48, tis a that is a message that's given all the time around so senility and efficiencies and that i would say that's an expectation of department has and then last year we approve our sustainable plan and there's a number of goals outlined in there and some of them are very specific to certain death depended the analysis that these are priorities over the next four years so those god twenty twenty one i am the department heads who have responsibility for those should be building on tintoret recommendations from individual rights continued to be attacked on the national stage how is the city protecting citizens concerning about their rights being taken away another was a state and put up by the city
3408.72,3426.21, in people to report harassment anything like that yes please report it to our place apartment so i have had multiple conversations with bracelets commission as well as our police teeth and we absolutely want people to report 
3426.21,3449.79, crimes and concerns they have let us know about it but were also being productive too so the chief has been going out meeting with different groups of individuals letting them know what their rights are letting them know that we're safe city for them he's gone out and know that he just recently met with individuals
3449.85,3469.62, in the community to talk to them and hear their concerns and listen and then to give them information so that they know what their rights are so he's very committed as a ornery one in our police department to those relationships thinnest the intention to place department
3470.01,3517.95, report them we need to know about them so that we can respond appropriately used the term safe city and it was a different context but when it comes to immigrants is grand rapids safe city the federal declaration that that can't happen yes so we are welcoming city an we we actually signed on to be welcoming city about a year and a half ago and we are committed to be inclusive safety for immigrants and katherine
3518.25,3523.74, that and that again what do people do who can they go to if they have problems
3523.77,3545.25, well then closes up but just quick mention that you brought them attention neighborhood some it is on marcheth and you said by the next time we get together we'll be looking at neighborhood metfords were out about that then i machination here this is it connection on tarts liberation the clash
3545.34,3575.88, thanks for joining us
