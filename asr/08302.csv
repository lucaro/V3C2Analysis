35.4,40.29, if you miss it of the series you can catch up on our website at
40.41,45.21, some of our life groups are also doing this series
45.33,52.44, so there are discussing questions that how is making an put them on the website they're also oronte video page
52.47,55.5, your life group like to follow long and this series
55.68,66.12, there are a bunch of different ideas about the book of revelation among christians and so i'm going to teach you as best i can what i believe to be true
66.24,80.73, i'm thankful that it's been a long time since anna and i have had to go church shopping actually spend twenty three years twenty three years ago passerina ed me and asked if
80.94,85.47, we would pray about coming to the church at our galesworth leader
85.47,88.32, and the youth master at that time
88.35,95.55, the church voted on new staff and the way it went a search committee would interview
96.06,106.77, perspective new staff and benefit passed that interview in the church the whole church would interview the perspective new staff and in that went well then the whole church would vote
107.01,111.78, so we decided that before all that took place that we would come check you out first
112.14,117.33, so anon the kids visited one sunday in this was a long time ago the church was quite
117.42,120.78, different then and it's just say that it was quite
122.31,124.74, things worked out and so here we are
124.92,126.48, years later
126.69,133.68, looking for a new church is hard work in fact some of you may even be here today chickens out
133.98,135.33, bless you
135.66,138.63, it so difficult to know
139.05,146.34, church can have beautiful buildings and a lot of smiling faces but it's possible for those
146.4,150.54, beautiful buildings and smiling faces to be hiding a bunch of
150.63,153.33, serious problems that are on the inside
154.41,157.5, then the other side of that is that a church
157.62,160.62, i have below average facilities but
160.8,166.05, the inside can have a very godly loving fellowship going on
166.65,169.8, only we had x ray vision
170.4,175.59, sometimes that's not even goodenough i've been having some new pain and so i went to see doctor he can
175.89,178.56, and he took an extra and i wasn't good enough
178.77,182.31, he sent me to get and that was an experience
182.67,184.92, he shows
185.19,186.36, everything
187.02,191.79, it was possible for us to take a m of the church that we were checking out
192.63,195.81, in a way it is you know jesus
196.17,198.3, and of the church
198.84,204.87, correctly inspect a church because he can see what's going on
205.17,212.88, the inside he knows the motives that he knows the intent he knows why we really do what we do
213.75,217.86, that's what revelation chapter two in chapter three are really all about
218.07,221.34, even messages to john
221.49,225.84, the churches in asia minor and that's what we discussed last week
226.11,233.88, the messages were not just for the seven churches but were meant for all churches even
233.94,236.13, church and organ
236.58,246.96, i also speaking to us as individual believers in the seven messages because churches are not just buildings
247.23,248.82, a people
249.36,254.1, is it just a place we go church is something that we do
254.4,259.17, not a lot churches who churches not an now it's a verb
259.62,268.2, the people who determined the spiritual life of this gathering of the levers that we call the local church
268.56,272.22, we must supply all the teaching
273.69,276.18, up to us all examine
276.21,278.22, own heart
278.4,286.89, as we read the seven letters to the churches that are also written to every church that are also written to every believer
287.19,293.07, some things that we need to remember that will help us to understand and better apply
293.07,294.18, teaching
294.81,296.43, the letters were written
296.43,300.87, the liver to actual churches the letter
300.96,305.7, dressed actual problems that were going on in the churches
306.75,314.37, also these letters addressed issues good and bad behavior good and bad that are happening in
314.61,316.56, all churches
316.65,317.76, every church
317.82,326.34, you see local churches have their own personality as you get to know a local church you will see in these churches
326.43,333.75, their nature characteristics and elements that are in all seven of these churches that will be looking at
334.44,340.11, the way to see the seven letters to these churches is that these letters are prophetic
340.44,344.58, the church as a whole goes through periods and phases
344.64,349.77, as a church begins with emphasis and it goes through the church at laodicea
350.76,356.46, where beginning and chapter two will be in revelation chapter two
356.64,358.53, verse one
359.04,361.14, the angel of the church
361.14,362.82, i
363.06,366.39, now it's getting with you last week about the past
366.42,370.86, the angel of the church but i think that actually is the best
371.04,373.29, interpretation of the scripture
373.32,375.9, i struggle i see in myself
376.11,379.2, as the angel devil may be
379.38,383.16, but anon know so so pray for me
383.88,386.31, i was a port city
386.55,393.33, a very rich and it had a lot of sin kind of like a mixture of new york city in las vegas
394.35,404.61, even though it was several miles from the sea it had river access and so it was the greatest harbor in asia minor it became known as the gateway
404.97,410.55, there was a center of worship for the greek god artemis and the roman
410.73,412.26, diana
412.59,414.12, simple as there
414.51,421.83, some well known famous people who are in leadership at different times in the church of that emphasis paul served there
422.04,424.32, john serve their timothy
424.38,425.85, there
426.48,432.09, these are the words of him who holds the seven stars
432.33,441.0, his right hand we saw last week that the seven stars are the seven angels and the seven angels are the seven pastors of these seven churches
442.02,445.29, are the words of him who holds the stars
445.65,447.96, his right hand so that means
448.08,449.91, god has
449.94,451.35, pastor
451.95,453.48, in his right hand
454.17,459.24, read this bunch of times and i don't know i just never really saw that and i saw that this week and
459.51,461.55, some comfort came from that
461.97,464.46, god has us in his right hand
464.91,468.03, that god has the church in his right hand
468.39,473.49, i believe that god has every believer in his right hand to
475.47,477.33, for to
477.6,478.98, to
479.43,480.99, no you need
481.2,483.99, hard work and your perseverance
484.38,486.87, great to be encouraged by someone
487.05,489.48, don't you love hearing from your balls
489.63,491.13, job
491.43,494.43, how about here and that from god does guiebet er than i
495.45,499.92, this was a serving church and that's wonderful
500.1,501.96, doing good
501.99,505.83, they were making a difference in their community that's some
506.07,508.71, church at ephesus have been faithful
508.71,516.03, over years even in the middle of a difficult pagan culture
518.28,521.7, now that you cannot tolerate wicked people
522.12,528.45, you have tested those who claimed to be apostles but are not and have found them false
528.72,530.79, the people mentioned here
531.0,539.73, not murderers and robbers and the doctors and prostitutes these wicked people here in revelation are church people
540.99,544.05, church people with an evil agenda
545.37,551.31, they are calling at the church at or goes to be a church for people who don't like
553.59,555.87, people who have been hurt
556.14,558.3, church somewhere in their past
558.6,565.35, people who have a negative stereotype of church and i just aside they're not coming we're trying to be a church
565.47,567.21, those people
567.48,571.77, but we are not a church for people who want to hurt
571.98,572.97, church
573.42,574.62, difference
575.04,576.39, a 
576.63,588.0, all warned the church of miss that there would be false teachers that would come from without the church that there would be false teachers that would come from within the church that want to hurt
589.59,605.79, satan can use people to call the vision and hurt the church and that is not to be tolerated god was commending the church at ephesus for identifying these wicked people and removing them from the church
606.45,608.58, it down to vex
608.82,611.07, you have this in your favor
611.37,616.71, you hate the practices of the nicolaitans which i also
618.03,624.9, he is a strong word it's a word we try not to use but when god uses it we need to take notice
625.23,627.84, hates sin
628.5,630.75, doesn't hate the center
631.11,633.93, here god hates the practices
633.93,641.64, this group of people called the niccola and so who are the nicolaitans the word nicolaitans to conquer
641.76,642.87, people
643.17,652.89, group of people or teaching in the church that there needed to be a division between the regular common lowly believers
652.98,660.21, and the high and all mighty religious leaders who have special rights and privileges
660.57,667.89, i don't know how far to go with this but i mean it's always kind of annoyed me a little bit you know the reserve parking spaces and the
667.95,671.82, thrown upon the platform and all that mass
673.95,678.39, taught that if you want to get the god that you had to go through them
678.66,681.15, that's just complete false teaching
681.45,687.6, the scriptures teach that all of god's people that all believers are priests
688.53,700.32, and that we all have equal access to god the father through the blood of jesus christ that weak and all come boldly to the throne of god
700.38,702.75, to go through any one else
704.31,705.84, the three
706.44,708.18, persevered
708.33,713.76, have endured hardships for my name and have not grown
714.09,715.14, weary
715.59,717.24, no commendation
717.27,732.69, so the church and emphasis is a serving church is an enduring church its a patient churches a faithful church is a church that values the truth man i wouldn't mind that the inside about my church that's a pretty good description
733.98,735.6, there was a problem
736.68,737.97, first for
738.69,740.97, i hold this against you
741.78,745.14, you have forsaken the love
745.23,747.03, you had at first
748.23,755.01, doing all of the right stuff it looked real good on the outside
755.1,757.35, but not on the inside
758.4,759.93, had a problem
760.35,762.36, and it was a heart
762.6,763.53, problem
763.74,769.95, the good things that they were doing was not motivated by the love for jesus
770.55,777.84, what we do for god is important but even more important is why
777.87,779.22, we do it
779.64,783.63, what does it mean by the love you had
783.66,784.74, first
785.46,799.47, i said and it's a shame but usually it's best understood and explained by looking at the spirit and the actions of a brand new christian a brand new believer because they have passion
799.59,809.43, and excitement and they can't keep it in and they got to tell somebody about it it's like the honeymoon love of a newly married couple
810.33,812.43, like a healthy marriage
812.73,814.35, i grow
814.44,822.75, become more deep and more rich in time a healthy relationship with jesus will continue to grow
822.96,824.76, and richer
824.88,825.99, so
826.77,833.16, as soon as we begin to take our relationship with god for granted
834.54,838.02, soon as you follow into the every day
838.08,839.49, routine
839.94,845.13, you began to just go through the motions of coming to church
846.48,848.94, you have forsaken the love
849.72,851.43, had it first
852.9,853.98, you can
854.07,855.69, serving
856.74,859.17, that doesn't mean you're worshipping
860.55,865.5, keep doing the right thing but that doesn't mean you're doing it in love
867.18,869.04, so can we do about it
869.88,871.23, five
871.92,875.1, consider how far you have fallen
876.12,877.32, repent
877.59,880.26, do the things you did
880.26,881.58, first
881.91,887.4, consider how far you have fallen means to look back and remember and to continue
887.61,888.96, remembering
889.26,893.58, remember what it was like when jesus first found you
893.76,903.51, and new experience his forgiveness and his grace and his mercy and the joy that filled your soul
903.96,909.33, and then you need to repent and to repent means to do a one eighty
909.72,914.91, completely turn around and go the other way
915.33,920.73, and then do the things that you did at first in other words get back to the basic
921.06,925.95, make it a pity to spend time in the bible
926.04,927.63, to pray
927.66,928.83, every day
930.21,932.37, serve others
932.58,934.17, and give
934.2,937.89, generously that gets the eyes of of yourself
938.01,942.84, serve others give generously with the right heart
943.5,945.54, ask god to help you
945.54,951.06, live a holy life you can't live a holy life in your own power ask god to help you do that
951.78,953.58, and then invest
953.94,956.64, it invest in other people
957.06,960.33, invite them to come with you on sunday
960.33,963.12, that can rekindle the love
963.39,965.01, you had it first
966.87,969.15, consider how far you fallen
969.33,975.24, repent and do the things you did it first if you do not repent
976.11,978.06, i will come to you
978.42,981.78, remove your lap and
982.32,983.88, from its place
984.9,991.56, so that the lamp stand is symbolic of the church when a church loses its love
991.95,995.46, twon't be long before it also loses
995.64,997.05, like
1000.11,1001.52, rich
1001.91,1004.31, i was powerful
1004.76,1009.17, church was busy and it was doing all kinds of awesome stuff
1010.04,1012.44, the lamps and
1012.53,1013.76, was
1014.0,1015.59, move
1017.87,1020.99, is a pile of ruin
1021.47,1024.38, there is no light shining
1027.38,1031.43, we were building this church building building a
1032.27,1034.22, about years ago
1035.33,1039.71, we went around town looking at other buildings to get ideas of the design
1041.42,1045.05, there was one that we went to not only be judgment but
1045.83,1048.77, just felt weird when we went there and
1049.4,1053.42, just seem like they were cocky i think in another word
1054.32,1056.3, we build the church like that one
1057.44,1060.71, i drove out at tergether day
1061.28,1063.23, a big force son out front
1064.82,1066.89, they were in the news a while back
1066.98,1069.38, it was you know the bad kind of news
1071.42,1074.72, apparently they had forsaken the love that they had at first
1075.71,1077.24, god removed
1078.05,1079.25, and
1082.61,1085.7, ever has ears
1085.76,1090.14, hear what the spirit says to the churches
1091.22,1095.99, the one who is victorious i will give the right to eat from the tree of life
1096.83,1099.17, in the paradise
1099.95,1102.83, god the good thing here in verse seven
1103.79,1106.55, even though a church may fall
1107.81,1112.79, individual believers can remain faithful to god
1112.91,1114.53, no matter what
1114.77,1117.14, everyone else thus
1117.89,1120.05, the churches
1121.19,1124.85, their business distract them from the main
1126.11,1135.86, and the crazy thing as the busy stuff that they were doing was all good stuff but the busy stuff got them off of their mission
1137.12,1144.59, for the church at our gallus to lead people and to a growing relationship which cheeses christ
1144.89,1149.96, we can never allow anything to get us off
1152.51,1154.37, the next church will look at
1154.46,1156.83, the letter to the church at sparta
1158.87,1161.99, to the angel of the church and speaight
1162.02,1168.65, these are the words of him who is the first and the last who died and came to life
1168.92,1169.88, in
1170.09,1174.83, was the description of jesus that we saw in chapter one
1175.07,1177.17, he is the alpha
1177.47,1179.93, and omega the beginning and the end
1180.38,1183.53, words smart a means more
1184.04,1187.31, was the perfume they used to
1187.46,1190.79, not an embalmed dead bodies
1191.75,1195.2, how would you like to live in a city called from out
1200.3,1204.65, the city of sparta was called the crown of asia it was the center of
1204.83,1207.38, science and medicine
1208.43,1212.45, smart was very loyal to rome and so many
1212.57,1216.62, the people actually worship the emperor as a god
1217.61,1220.91, first i i know your flictions
1220.97,1225.11, and your poverty yet you are
1225.11,1226.16, i
1226.34,1232.31, church a smart new was being persecuted because they refused to worship the emperor
1234.35,1236.24, because of their faith
1236.36,1238.91, they stood for what they believed then
1239.09,1243.41, impossible for them to get work they were excluded from getting the job
1244.58,1246.74, in physical things
1246.98,1252.62, they were poor that were here for poor actually means not just poor means they had nothing
1253.82,1255.32, their faith
1256.31,1257.75, rich
1260.03,1264.35, now about the slander of those who say they are jews and are not
1264.53,1267.53, a synagogue of satan
1267.86,1269.78, even though they were jewish
1269.87,1273.92, spiritually they were not true jews but spiritual pagans
1274.85,1281.09, the romans did not allow observance of other religions but they made an exemption for the jewish people
1281.54,1283.64, so it was the romans
1283.76,1287.48, the jewish people against the christians
1287.54,1289.37, it was very difficult
1289.85,1291.89, the church at smart
1294.29,1296.93, not be afraid of what you're about to suffer
1297.53,1304.34, tell you the devil will put some of the imprisoned a test and you will suffer persecution for ten days
1304.61,1307.46, was encouraging them that he knew
1308.03,1311.81, devil's plan and at it was up to and that it would not last
1311.87,1313.16, very long
1313.76,1315.56, be faithful
1315.8,1317.78, even to the point of death
1318.2,1320.63, and i will give you life
1320.66,1322.43, your victors
1323.03,1325.82, and a musician sang about
1325.91,1327.17, a morning
1327.98,1330.32, victor's crown as the crown
1330.35,1333.44, awarded at the athletic contests that
1333.5,1341.84, so big in this day that martainville in but this crown referred to a much more valuable crown the crown of life
1343.88,1350.18, whoever has the ears but them here what the spirit says to the churches the one who is victorious
1350.36,1353.12, not be heard at all by the second
1353.36,1358.94, because they put their complete faith and trust in god they had nothing to fear
1359.12,1361.58, even if they were martyred heaven
1361.67,1366.26, their home they had the crown of life and no fear
1366.26,1373.88, the second death the first step is the physical death the second death is the eternal death which they would not experience
1373.94,1376.76, as they had eternal life in jesus
1377.72,1379.4, most of us
1379.52,1381.38, one way or another
1381.68,1384.89, expect to get rich in some way
1385.1,1386.9, we choose to
1387.02,1391.1, followed jesus that in some way we will be blessed
1392.81,1394.67, the church and smart
1395.69,1398.9, found that they were all ready
1398.9,1400.01, rich
1400.91,1403.49, even if following jesus
1403.88,1405.5, call them
1405.89,1407.15, everything
1408.86,1411.56, that for the prosperity gospel
1413.75,1416.63, the letter to the church at pergamus
1417.35,1420.8, was called the greatest city in asia minor
1422.72,1425.63, the angel of the church in pergamos right
1425.9,1429.95, these are the words of him who has the sharp double edged sword in other words
1430.25,1431.57, word of god
1433.61,1435.89, i know where you live
1436.4,1439.97, satan has his throne would you like to live there
1441.17,1443.33, was the headquarters of
1443.42,1452.36, satanic opposition and false religions there was a huge throne shaped altar there to the gods zeus
1453.32,1455.81, like a great place the plane church
1458.15,1460.7, you remain true to my name
1461.03,1465.44, you did not renounce your faith and may not even in the days of antipas
1465.71,1468.86, faithful witness who was put to death in your city
1468.86,1470.45, we sat
1470.51,1473.75, lives antipas was probably the pastor
1473.81,1475.55, the church and smart
1475.61,1482.75, he refused to compromise and was martyred but others in the church compromising gave in and send
1483.71,1485.57, nevertheless
1485.75,1487.43, a few things
1487.46,1488.57, against you
1489.38,1501.53, there are some among you who hold to the teaching of belem who taught alecto entice the israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrifice to idols and committed sexual immorality
1501.8,1504.83, can read the story of balaam and the old testament
1504.83,1507.74, numbers through 
1507.86,1514.58, as an all full sinful scheme and some in this church worshiped by it
1517.76,1523.58, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the nicolaitans
1524.3,1526.04, here they are again
1526.13,1529.22, the same untrewe doing an emphasis
1529.28,1536.93, repent therefore otherwise i soon come to you and fight against them with the sword of my mouth
1537.2,1541.01, the pastor had experienced the sword of the romans
1541.19,1542.75, was put to death
1542.99,1544.94, the church at paris
1544.94,1549.71, fill the sort of christ if they did not repent and change
1551.33,1556.34, whoever has the ears let them hear what the spirit says to the churches
1556.34,1567.8, to the one who is victorious i will give some of the hidden manner i will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it known only to the one who
1567.92,1569.18, it
1569.66,1573.05, god fed israel with the manna
1573.35,1578.39, has promised the feed the believers with the spiritual bread
1579.02,1587.09, athlete in the games he was presented a white stone that gave him admitted to the victory celebration
1587.48,1589.97, white stone here could be
1589.97,1593.87, symbolic of being admitted to the celebration and heaven
1594.44,1600.74, name written on the stone could be so special that only the one receiving it knows what it is
1601.7,1607.58, even though some in the church of pergamos stood strong many compromised
1607.79,1608.81, faith
1609.98,1612.68, church or an individual
1613.13,1617.36, compromise is their faith for their own benefit or to avoid
1617.36,1621.62, suffering has committed spiritual adultery
1622.1,1624.71, as unfaithful to god
1625.46,1627.02, calls
1627.08,1628.79, to repent
1629.33,1631.34, before it's too late
1632.63,1634.85, the last church we look at today
1635.24,1636.89, it
1637.37,1641.54, located halfway between pergamus and sardis
1641.57,1643.43, a military town
1643.49,1646.4, a lot of commerce but it's known
1646.4,1650.21, it's no unpossibility
1652.76,1657.86, the angel of the church in that tower right these are the words of the son of god
1657.92,1663.56, eyes are like blazing fire whose feet are like burnished bronze
1663.65,1671.87, i know your need your love and faith your service and your perseverance and that you are now doing more than you did at first
1672.32,1680.09, church is serving its loving it's hanging in there and that's all good stuff first twenty
1680.3,1681.77, nevertheless
1681.77,1683.84, i have this against you
1684.32,1687.17, tolerate that woman jezebel
1687.26,1689.54, calls herself a profit
1689.81,1697.46, her teaching she misleads her my servants into sexual morality and the eating of food sacrifice to idols
1699.83,1706.79, i have given her time to repent of her morality and she is unwilling
1707.45,1713.93, church was allowing a woman who called herself a prophet to influence them to compromise
1714.56,1718.52, she was a type of jessamine familiar
1718.85,1723.77, a story of the old testament gospel was a very wicked queen
1724.52,1726.95, had given her many chances
1727.16,1729.08, refused
1729.56,1734.48, now she would be punished along with those who chose to follow her
1736.97,1739.67, i will cast her on a bed of suffering
1739.82,1746.09, make those who commit adultery with her suffering any unless they repent of her ways
1748.49,1754.43, strike her children dead this is speaking of those who choose to follow her
1755.15,1763.67, all the churches will know that i am he who searches hearts and minds and i will repay each of you according
1763.73,1765.26, our
1765.83,1770.45, thank god everyone in this church had not been unfaithful
1770.9,1776.87, had been had a special word for the faithful people and first 
1777.56,1791.81, i say to the rest of you and that are to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned sat in so called deep secrets i will not impose any other burden on you except
1791.84,1794.84, hold on to what you have
1795.05,1797.18, i
1798.65,1805.28, until i come refers to the time when jesus will come to take his church
1805.64,1811.01, the first mention of what we refer to as the rapture
1811.97,1816.11, these four churches emphasis smyrna
1816.65,1828.08, yet we probably would not have chosen smyrna as the spiritual one of these churches but god did
1828.32,1832.07, that's usually what he does the exact opposite
1832.13,1833.9, what we
1836.54,1839.45, we've listened to these four letters
1840.08,1842.78, any of this challenge you
1843.17,1844.64, your walk
1844.82,1846.92, god is challenged
1848.87,1851.0, god sees the heart
1852.71,1855.65, while we do is important as what
1858.65,1861.62, that we should not forsake the love
1862.07,1865.22, that we had at first and that is so
1869.51,1873.32, we need to remain faithful even when it means
1873.41,1874.55, suffering
1875.87,1881.63, put our complete faith and trust in god and in god alone and nothing else
1882.35,1885.95, and then this hold on to what we have
1886.61,1887.96, he comes
1888.71,1890.93, he is coming back
1891.65,1893.96, and nobody knows when
1894.38,1897.62, and so what we need to do is be ready
1898.85,1906.68, means we need to have a relationship with god by accepting his son and to our life and repenting of our sin
1906.83,1912.74, that means if the christian we need to be right with god and right with him right now
1913.22,1916.64, we can do that by repenting of our sin and turning
1916.73,1919.1, and don't put that off
1920.06,1921.83, i choose that
