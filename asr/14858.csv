0.03,15.27, the kalamoun scott watershed has been out of focus form and function for the last one hundred and sixty years
16.17,21.54, over that time knowledge and reflection has led to one singular conclusion
33.39,40.89, it was founded retain the same time eighteen fifties and so nobody can remember a time when kalora
41.31,43.56, flowed into the lane river
43.89,55.59, like was created in eighteen fifty eight when the original killian was put in to power a gristmill the grime was called the standard mill and it was filled by one of awakeners joseph killoge
55.77,115.65, but there in the highway above it have been a part of our infrastructure here in our life here to waterloo bodies had only gotten more in trenches the highway still here the milligan the canadas yourself why do we still have the dam it's complicated by several factors one is this a highway running over top of it that i was not going anywhere it complicated by the fact that this passage here is very much affected by high drollery that is the rate of water movement its also complicated by the fact that what's up stream of this dam is contaminated the lake bed has been bill through the years with all kinds of sediment unofficially actually been illegal dominating the lake and finally obviously there's a funny challenged has the money to do it
116.94,121.74, yet the vision of dambool and a healthy vibrant watershed lives on
121.77,128.4, this is the beginning part of caloric so what happens here affects calicut not only does it
128.46,150.78, he is clockin hen don't scott creek so while we're doing here even though here we are in doncaster gan far away from anything actually impacts a story organ when it rains a lot is this wet land here will absorb some of that water and a slow down its flow and conversations we've had with neighbors down stream they recognize
150.84,154.14, value of our earthward preserving a we know
154.44,159.96, knowledge came to a local church from a watershed far far away
160.14,169.02, we have a relationship with livia or working on rucuses of poverty and hunger and
169.05,175.86, water is what they have poonsch of our churches decided investigate that
175.92,184.23, so we thought about doing the one lamothe columbia and then somehow somebody mentioned well you know we have a creek
184.41,189.75, on the back of our property here and then we started
190.11,191.49, saying i know
191.73,196.71, the about that well or found out there but that the city was doing
196.86,198.27, thinking about
198.33,213.39, the dominant fourteen years the city of milwaukee been working with state and other local jurisdictions to find ways to improve our local natural habitat and an integrated with a downtown plan that will really promote
213.39,219.75, wake is a place where we can all live work in play and have access to natural open spaces
219.99,234.12, removing the cello dan we do all of that there's only one map that shows what this area would have looked like before the damnability fifty eight and is an original survey that was done in eighteen fifty one when milwaukee was first being settled
234.18,285.6, it depicts killock as of meandering free flowing creek footnote the water so can i do this but at people i think don't realize is the opportunity here be able to connect saltonstone and riverfront this project there is about ten feet of queer swearing in this floor actually going to lower when we do the same projection of satiation downtown alternating ossifications out in the region as one that
285.66,289.47, going to provide a multitude of benefits ecological
289.56,313.65, social public health related cultural were extremely excited at the watershed council that the city of milwaukee has been moving forward toward removing the dam and we are eager to do our part to be a partner in any way that we can some people are not church and not because they were member the history of the lake and
313.89,316.32, it was more protein
316.35,326.16, an interview that i conducted with meakins i found that during the twenties thirties and forties noises used and retreated on the lake
326.22,330.45, extensively they say that on it the fish in it eliminate
330.6,341.46, most of the private properties that surround the lake had docked that went out into the lake and people use those all summer long and really shared a lot of great memories on killala
342.06,352.11, they both thought that the lake whom we started talked about this and turn was a part of the source system that was the whole thing tank 
352.35,375.03, nineteen fifties there was a real estate firm in milwaukee called chronometers and they struck a deal with a grave company that was on the willamet where they would have the gravel company demeura graveled it couldn't be sold because of its size straight in the killala and that dumping spurred a period of kind of community disgust
375.09,398.76, neglect towards the lake on the dumping went on for about one decade while the lakes immediate neighbors tried extensively to stop the dumping fate took the chamberers to confort and then eventually to see court and after about ten years they did stop the dumping but not before over fifty thousand cubic yards of refuse wisdom into the southerly
399.39,411.54, here are the banks of killala only a stone's throw from downtown i wake and you really would know this place is here unless you actually
411.72,416.58, got down and tried to fight your way towards the bank to the shore and
416.79,425.1, this is really kind of illustrates the opportunity we have you know there's really no way to get down to this the water here
425.94,428.67, facing the main stimulant river
429.0,434.34, thinking like a fish her you got till our creek coming up behind me
434.43,436.47, passing over the small dam
437.01,440.85, and this dam has created a real impediment for
441.03,442.59, fish
442.59,446.46, to take shelter in areas like clark
447.51,448.47, and
448.77,451.62, perspective wellriver keeper
451.65,454.05, a lot of sense to take this dam out
454.26,458.43, the kind of project that can yield tremendous benefits for
458.52,460.62, i like oo
460.65,467.73, another species the need that connection that natural connection that has been around from millennia
468.06,470.82, from big rivers to their tributaries
471.39,502.68, material like kilauea in the connecticut to the lancone essential to a range of species a large shallow warm basically muadan it became impossible for his fish to make their way through this into the upper reaches particularly with an abundance of nine native visit had taken root here in the warm water and we lost our fisheries on the interview this area was
502.74,509.49, agriculture all up and down lake road and agriculture at that time used
509.52,514.14, highly toxic as decides like dainty
514.14,528.24, he
529.56,563.67, for well over twenty years there's been organizations working up stream from calling to provide restoration efforts so that we can eventually get fish back up into those streams and provide spaces for people to recreate and have the natural space in harmony with our urban surroundings that series probably alike six or eight years old who put it in but never does a favorite as in favor tradesman's really cool and complex it's great for the salmon world so those two live together well
564.15,571.8, i will call her and i live on a hundred twenty second avenue just up stream from the dam here on no score
571.92,574.56, the game used to be i'm not scott creek
574.56,575.7, we had
575.76,579.63, and here with water that was
579.66,581.76, really good for much other than
582.0,584.43, voting on once in a while
584.73,587.82, a very warm no trees around
588.15,590.34, very little habitat
591.57,593.43, years ago
593.43,596.13, county in the state came in and we had it
596.4,597.81, remove the dam
598.29,604.44, with sole help and friends of trees help has replanted what you now see behind me
605.82,610.68, it's an area that is cool in the summer
610.83,623.19, certainly has made the water temperature better and better for fish and the dam right behind us figurine that wasn't a very good with hair so entente repaired or come out
623.22,625.86, and so the kind of decided to take it out
626.01,630.63, the service water technician at the time karen streeter 
630.69,654.66, with our engineer to design a project that would remove the dam in two thousand and three blacks county produced a documentary about the removal of the hunter and twenty second avenue dan alabaster gaminerie site so that a great father were standing right now was the dam there used to be a dam he went across that way
654.84,660.99, an earthen dam constructed in the mids for irrigation and live stock watering purposes
661.02,710.46, the trees excited to be a part of this project here at the immobile we planted during with the help of dozens of volunteers from the community this has been a really successful example of what could be done at the mouth of a superior of the right which was a thereabouts really good harvests
710.55,721.65, set and sediment made mock warm water that was a problem for what equality because then though the water was very shallow going through the pond area
721.65,723.87, so would keep that shallow water up
723.99,734.61, very warm and then the fish that live down stream they were not very happy and that in that very warm water because salmon need cold clean water in order to survive
735.09,745.17, by removing the dam and reconstructing the stream channels through the site we were able to reduce the water temperature by almost ten degrees for night that's a lot for one project
745.32,750.24, and by reconstructing this stream channel through here we were able to
750.24,754.83, that the fish can smash the sight into the spanning habitat about
755.52,760.98, i like to see us at some point in time have fish return to the area and spot here
761.07,766.65, there are other places in clock and count the fish are spawning and backyard just no reason i can't it happen here
767.94,773.73, but the call darwood have to be removed for selfish to get back up here to where they were
774.03,784.05, but the good news is that we can bring them back we can restore that prison quite a credit about it is because i think you'll know that i have been
784.23,789.45, and hopefully referring to the idea that we've been talking about for several months now
789.57,791.4, as 
791.43,795.03, road map forgetting all the way through
795.03,848.91, initiative portland harbor superfine process under which those who damage the ecosystem ere the harbour those who polluted it and will have to make some recompense to the public for damages that were created one of the beings in industries going to have to do as part of superficial resource damages that men die the maupertuis here and what that is is essentially a requirement that they mitigate for the negative impact that the pollution is had over time on the river on the different values missionaire process now figuring out how much that's going to be and trying to abortion at and what that will be used for its restoration sits up and down the river the calculate
849.03,860.13, did or damage or injury to natural resources sources and to equate that to amount of restoration that it's going to take to bring this species back to where they were before the contamination
860.25,925.41, basically right peart atop and the feasibility so were just starting to look at this sight to see can we do it can we finance it that's what while and bring to the table financing and also all the expertise the you know that i talked about earlier so design and permitting an entitlements and all of our previous experts from all our other projects waldron who organization the privately owned and operated in the air coming in at no cost to the city except for some staff time to execute this project now what the credits are depend on it he retorted in this particular case the credits are called day and so the people who need the restoration are told that they need count of days and we are told how many days a restoration project will generate and that way we know how many days we have to sell if we do what we said we were going to do and create the habitat that we have designed and proposed interest is actually what fun the monitoring and maintenance
925.59,950.55, ever intense very nice too plainly connection and riparian restoration that's been done the years and that's a kind of thing that could happen on kilauea to great benefit as i said and both of these systems we need more work overtime but johnson creep provides a really nice example of the kind of thing that can be accomplished and cellar
951.45,956.61, at the confluence of the william river and the columbia columbia
956.64,960.18, of course comes down from british columbia for over miles
960.42,1008.36, the biggest fishery in the world so i think on the lowest only our opportunity but it's our i think it's our obligation to send down cold clean salmon filled waters who the willamet and thus the columbia why do we want fish back in the kilgris well fish are an important indicators species in the northwest the part of the food chain that covers all the way from the small invertebrate living in the bottom of the stream up to the large birds and even some of the larger predator mackensen like this are really a way of saying the future this is whom we are as a people we care about our natural voices we want a
1008.36,1010.55, space for nature in our communities
1012.5,1041.96, our daily lives this project needs to happen i means to happen soon not only will we restore fish habitat here in milwaukee but barrie habitat of the twenty seven miles up stream will restore areas that people can enjoy and recreate in a link a great vibrant economic downtown but what really important what we are doing here is we are giving a gift to our future generations to our children
1042.62,1045.35, i love about this project is
1047.24,1059.21, would do but the fact that i can not tell where the borders are between our church and the community anymore it but what the community what's the church
1059.39,1063.26, lengthe and we're all working to try to
1063.77,1069.41, creation back the word it was and still is to a moth
1070.1,1130.46, now is the time for us to come together and seize the opportunity restoration is in our grasp don't fail the watershed on damietta
