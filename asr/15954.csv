2.34,12.39, sampei guess to talk about one root which is a community attentat i started with two really really good friends about six years ago
12.57,16.53, we were talking a lot about how we contains the world and
16.56,21.69, conversations in the up coming right back to the arts and the ability to art has to
21.69,25.68, transita language about language till about boundaries
25.77,33.54, and so this is a picture intermediate we had a lot of our conversations we would have been attained they weren't around back then
33.9,41.31, and so our coming up in these conversations and also like a sense of a community and social responsibility
41.52,44.58, so we started telling herself how can we
44.73,71.52, kind of combined the two here these are two are artists that were really influential to me a professor dulbahantas one of my compressors and got me sized sitting there with the glass on aweless so odd for me personally steilacoom and dare were were big instauration and so so balancing essence of art with the with the sense of community service and social responsibility and 
71.52,75.6, it kind of blossoms that it that's how we're going to see the world
75.78,92.16, so i started out west we saw doing you know community service projects out of our house this is some photographs ophelestes the middle of the night and then at once we really that idea started a company called wonders and
92.25,102.27, quickly learnt there was a design firm in new york with the name sea repertory came with the name that like a lot more its wondrous a balance between you know the idealism and that
102.36,116.4, sense of inspiration with a little bit of a run artist first website there ever had first whosoever made you can tell it to these fond and and stop it interests 
116.49,121.47, started going with that and then i guess
121.62,130.41, to of paper in the sea but are we discarding and things out of houses and then we decided we want to be in our prophets we did a tonford
130.56,136.59, after about two years of wealth is to get back to a spot patusan we did 
136.59,138.36, about a year of funding
138.45,144.51, and we finally made enough money to sign a lease on a building and easily and of themal drive
144.69,157.11, and so we're not architects we don't hang out architects professors so we do use two by fours and and hammers and things and we just portals we built walls
157.2,161.1, that's christen it to gustare with
161.19,164.46, i think they're working on the dark room
164.58,174.6, some benches in the dark room that's me we had a requireth whole place for computers so i spent a lot of time in the crowbar and it was really really really gross
174.72,184.26, like i was like oh my back crawling you know with like six inches between my chest and the floor suasit that i built to protect myself from all the 
184.35,192.78, grossness that underneath one so this is a a very technical a rendering of our space
192.96,196.92, on the lockers upstairs and on the
196.92,204.57, on the rail is the downstairs we have a recording studio dark room classroom titled ab surmised
204.57,220.83, offices a performance venue and he stayed to relate to no people say the sea ghost ah this is a still from the recording studio a and so what with space has become on an artistic level is a space you can come to a yaverland as members of unlimited access
221.01,230.67, i can record you know your album you can develop photographs you can now use a computer to poor you can make movies you can have your pan played or
230.7,240.03, basement it's really cool it's it's it's awesome place to come and make me like zero you know various to inter into making a
240.18,252.99, the balance that art side we also have a community service side so we have a seipsum stills these are programs were kids come in over the summer like a kiss at camp and 
253.08,257.25, everything from me how to paint you know faces and all the
257.43,261.99, and diagrams in geometry with base to book making the poetry
263.07,268.41, and so is that sense of the members of wonders that benefit from the space and 
268.41,277.17, that we have teaching these shops you know organizing these workshops and facilitating all these programming
280.2,285.87, so in addition to having kids come in and do things we also go out into the community and we will
