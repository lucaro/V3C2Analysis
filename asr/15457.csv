19.02,31.56, he and south korea he just made sure that we would not be seen very much in the open so we we were just waiting for poncas and then we went to certain places where they were the refugees
31.62,59.31, some of them we went out i think in the middle of the night was really picked up i even had no rope we were we seem to be in some in some village by the border and then i started asking if we can't see your face that's fine to or even just a shadow of that okay but its trees give us something of yourself if that's possible he and there they they felt labelled for no sir you know if you wish just put the head on your head i just gave yourself as you wish

84.42,88.92, this and he asked what that was he had never seen milanaise
89.31,97.86, one of the people who are also now you see in the images in the exhibition the activists standing like this
97.89,108.48, personally i was really shocked i had no idea that really exists it's like a very quiet story a very quiet but very powerful and i think it's a very important story to tell
108.6,110.91, think of that picture
110.97,120.9, a woman actually many people think it's a man it's the woman in her late sixties whose dedicated her life going in and out of north korea to help
120.9,124.77, to come out i don't know have so much iteration for these people
124.95,127.62, we met her
127.77,130.98, he finished been confiscated by the police
131.31,133.89, in order to prevent her from moving around
134.28,143.58, i i don't know what a soltanto this is not something you just do once on a time and then then you let go said does he write juriste it really doesn't foreright
146.07,148.11, two pictures
148.14,155.97, french one is the friendship brigandage china on the left hand side north korea on the right inside this
156.03,163.35, is used mostly for trade to transport goods to north korea i have another bride
163.41,165.48, and the two men are
165.93,167.79, right in the middle
167.85,185.19, that which is also used sadly to repatriate refugees if they are caught in tina among the people i met there was one elderly lady who was disabled was kind of stumbling and she had given us a eclosion of where she had crossed the border with it was that
185.43,186.57, cope
187.26,196.08, we just wanted to see it with our own eyes because it took her more than six days to reach tressaille this this constant fear you just feel it
197.37,207.87, somehow these pictures may be can help to explain the whole paranoia in fear be true you so white and the open your sooner it's a big big risk although does look like it at all and
207.93,212.85, presently think something may be that's also liking he thereof course you read about
212.91,222.09, not rebut mostly the leadership not that much about the refugees of the people even feel without understanding the language how then they aren't how paranoid
222.93,230.31, here also people who here they have asked me to artists of the stage pictures there not stage and they are not articles
