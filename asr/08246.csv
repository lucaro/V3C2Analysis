0.12,11.07, some hinted with more questions and answers and at that period in my life where i'm trying to figure out you know what the way is in my life and
11.1,25.71, and where i'm going and is there a difference between a person and an artist you know a lot of people say to me i really love to meet the real you the real outside of the art the reason
25.89,32.67, and it's very difficult for me to see a difference between the two and there's
33.0,39.15, a way that i started to kind of ask myself who am i and i started on the back of my bedroom door
39.3,56.37, the back of my bedroom door and i have multiples of the question who are you who are you so every time i leave my bedroom every time i leave my house every time i wake up i seen his question and it makes me think about whom i am i bein me who do i wish to be
56.46,61.23, and you know severer and you'll see a picture of me
61.53,125.97, behind the mask of my arm and the two started to blur together and when i talk conferences are usually like to start with a picture the kind of goes back to the beginning of who i am before we are before the creation and you'll see this is a piteous and sisters and an guess which one is mentioned in i'm proud to say my micatio urseren i'm not adopted i wasn't found on the street you know you know i just happened to have a different dad to my brothers and sisters which meant that i started out in life with a big rotheskirche was a little difficult and i would see that i was different to every one else but you know now that i have the kind of privilege or reflection i see that this gave me my passport my advantage in life
126.18,133.38, unlike my brothers and sisters they are made to fit in the kind of had that pressure to fit in with everyone else
133.41,138.66, when you look different soon as you step outside of your family home people treat you differently
138.69,144.63, i grew up in a place called tom's men which is in the south east london
144.72,149.13, some of you you know may have seen that a little bit because it's
149.49,202.11, in carinthia more recently so at show called misfits but the thing about them misassorted and it's one of these you know it was meant to be a topstone with money and without money or different backgrounds and eventually what happened as it happened to be a caledonian welchers off the ground nothing was undeserving all up so was a big playground to be grown up and knowing
202.44,206.91, that was fun but growing up here also
207.03,220.23, strength of me being an individual it also you know is very white very working class and like i say you're slightly tanned with an arrow you know you have those different challenges to the rest of your family when you leave your house and
220.29,268.74, i kind of express myself for i found the way that i could express myself was praying was true with creating my own kind of wells and realities and you know i would draw faces and as a kid and you know give them names and super powers and these would be my friend and my escape from where i grew up that ventimille me to a place concentrationist between that would be ended for the place called sententia london and discreetly opened up my eyes you know there was a lot of people from different background different incomes and we all really learn to work together and collaborate at the time you know when i was network was still a little bit dark and still trying to get rid of
268.77,276.45, all those things about growing up and my work at the time was a little unhappy this was a character of mine called hangman
276.54,281.04, and had the little heart and sometimes hang on with have a brief case
281.13,283.86, the idea is you know hang man
283.86,298.35, a business man that he himself used from a new and was kind of traveling the world and being unhappy and i think that was a little bit of me at the time and when i graduated at martin's in
298.62,363.3, on a nice little thing and i headed to japan and i was interested in japan and japanese colter because that same martin asleepe student on now i became that kid that hung out at all the japanese kids and you know had so shiftiness a week and saw the japanese movies and collected toys so i really had a connection with japan and in two thousand and three unmoved there and a kind of found that some of the work that is soon in the kathemenos been fit in because you know a lot of it was profanation and i wouldn't go in big trouble if i did that in japan so what happened is that i started to draw a lot smaller minver very fine pen like a zero point zero five which meant that the pamela to be disclosed when i was drawing to kind of see the paper and some of the drawing i did there you know it became a lot finer and a lot delicasies of mixture of two monsters and one thing about living in japan it made me okay with things being cute
363.57,385.98, so when you live in london as you know growing up in london there's something kind of antique about it but when you go to an everything is due and that kind of had an effect on me and my drawing and even though it was still little kind of unhappy or dark in a way a kind of adopted this cute face
386.31,389.01, this yeah his some drawer and then
389.43,406.32, these kind of different characters of carrying the old hand bags and holes in their heads and flowers in the pockets and bears in your pocket and so that was really like and i found that i could just kind of escape into the drawing like i did as a kid
406.38,412.11, i started to do some live visuals in clubs in japan or
412.11,435.99, started in more kind of alum god places so i would you know take my sketch book and draw under a cancan then that feed would be projected on the screen and then i would kind o do lie to on visual sometimes using my hands and magnifying girlies and moving it around and he is a picture of my hands and the pen at a time sometimes i would use post at nose
436.05,454.08, that were firm and to interact with people and dances and a minister very quick video of what that note like and you know the father thing about this and kind of accidently and enough in this world in japan of of doing visual and the avenging in the iridesced that
454.17,465.78, a hole on remusat i had no interest in or kind of dareall lie but it really helped to draw in the cause he kind of need to switch off in a way and when on a run a video clip
465.84,564.51, you example some of that first music i went out as some of the talk to the sky that's rum videoconference etiennette friendships you do some visual atmeidan in doing so morningtime let's draw under a camaradas how that will come to be and in overtime i went from kind of more of the analogous computers and drawing tables and drawin kind of more to dedannans and musicians and you know sometimes i would the experiment i guess this is around two thousand and four five but i would experiment with inutile computers and tablets and he can see i try to use my left hand in my right hand and you know that was a very good idea because that's what the left hand a lie and you know and an even drawing to to musicians and we're going to run a second video clear which is an example of the latter kind of digital stuff that was doing
564.87,593.19, i too and you can see here also that there's two screens as a screen at the front and the screen at the back is also experimenting again withdrawing with my left hand to my right hand and
593.25,600.18, screened in the back doesn't move that fast ever because that's my left hand
605.16,633.24, i and the great thing about this is kind of transition in from you know the more anoint the life of his realized that i was also a dancer so you have these guys dancing hearing frank but also be behind kind of drawing josefa as they would be done in and moving around and drawing more layers
633.57,636.87, just really really builds up which is fun
636.99,662.1, tom up a literary
663.48,694.83, oneself in the place where his running know kind of drawing here and the zoonomia if the crowd went you know you can write and zoetermeer something really special about working spontaneously and working in real time and the funny thing would be in japan you know would come up they
694.86,701.52, that turned into a whole collaboration of drawing on my hands and kind of drawing away over their face
702.3,705.33, sometimes with permanent pen sometimes not
705.33,707.58, and
707.61,709.53, i got through about
709.59,735.51, i think i lived in japan from and and towards the end of a i started to feel like i needed to go somewhere else like my life was making a change i knew that i would live in japan forever i didn't know if it would be one year yesterday i woke up and i said i want to anginette or for a holiday
735.54,742.56, any one goes to new york for the holiday for a first time we get there i love it and my god this place amazing i'm going to move here
742.95,761.04, i went to new for holiday loved it goniatites a few months later i moved there in two thousand and eight probably not the best time to move to new york ever and then when i got there i was like a crab you know yes new york has everything but if you move from tokio
761.25,786.81, you know it too or in japan there's a kind of huge sense of technology in collaboration and kind of a coterie
787.2,794.37, and but still in the very much de spontaneous life way so when i draw a use an audience
794.94,796.59, and
796.71,805.14, that the audience he drives men to kind of create these bigger installations or draw in and that's a lot of what i've been doing now as well
806.64,813.69, and the great thing about this is you know i pick up the pen and i'll destroy we're goin to run fer video
813.93,817.32, i'm going to talk a little bit about the process of the drawer in
817.5,827.4, that's wrong dearie so when i'm drawing there's a mission this white big piece of paper which at first was very intimidating for me
827.58,834.24, no i've discovered that the so much freedom and potential in a white cover so any converse
834.42,841.74, all start with a big fluid movement and is drawing and destroying the fillip the paper as much as possible
841.77,845.34, kind of create in the foundations of the future
845.52,863.64, i know where the pen go in the pen lowers going and i just follow so iverlastin to the pan and follow it and here you see me follow for though if there's a bump in the war may be thautapan other place if the pen goes black than we do some distaste
864.03,867.78, and then i'll step back and look to see as any kind of smoother
867.93,872.79, motions in the drawing and if there's a smooth aline i draw a nose
872.94,876.27, the mouth and eyes because that looks like a face
876.27,879.09, for an all these faces
879.27,884.61, and it's funny in a conference one day soon asked me why do your eyes that left
884.73,886.56, he all look left
886.74,891.0, he stood back and let some fast trains and said oh they all looked at
891.27,898.41, so i'm still trying to figure out some of what these ideas of symbols or language means when i draw them
898.59,908.04, if there's an angle that's more like a triangle i draw a bird being an if there's a bird beat you need an eye and for me words and drawing are the same thing
908.58,911.79, very spontaneous as all lines
912.06,915.0, and you say that we've been the world
915.54,919.5, then i always you know when i'm drawing i'm so close to the paper
919.71,921.72, when i stepped back
922.02,924.75, always a surprise to me that it was
924.96,928.44, i never really know what i'm drawing and till it's finished
934.23,939.93, sometimes people were as me how do i play that my composition and i say i dare injust happens and
939.96,942.27, every time i do it a surprise
944.34,945.6, and then we got
948.48,949.71, go back
952.65,956.85, so there's something really nice about the
957.45,967.26, expectations or the kind of the nooning where you go in and some one pointed out were actually a few people pointed out to me that my drawings look like maps
967.74,989.7, and i sed to think of myself like that and my man i myself am a tall and i'm making out where i'm going through my drawer in sometimes when i step back from my drawing say look so big and confident like they already existed or they always existed and i'm defining a way of pinamonti a place where we can see them
990.81,1002.84, it is very interesting to me to look back at some of the characters now and some of the the words were in my work and start to try and figure out what they mean to me
1002.87,1007.76, something i draw a lot is kind of an eye like this
1008.33,1010.13, i was loth to raffles
1010.22,1018.08, and you know that you go there's one there so i started to go back and pull out the meaning or
1018.26,1022.85, behind the behind the language of what some of these men and frame
1023.15,1034.16, i had to learn from decided what does that mean and for me i has always existed in the world but she was not always open let alone aware and responsive
1034.19,1038.66, singular string of a bent led ye to the practice of meditation
1038.87,1050.45, help her become much more accepting of the new experiences and more responsive towards the world at large now while this new openness is risen manifest
1050.48,1056.3, in the smooth regular shamed flower eyelashes that now frame eye
1056.39,1072.26, i also took back at some of those past drawings i did all those past characters and the one that i showed you at the beginning had less this is what headless means to me had lesuto get lots of headaches and was extremely troubled
1072.59,1078.29, by the past in an attempt to escape this he colors had
1079.25,1084.32, quickly realized that the shadow of his past was still firmly attached
1084.89,1100.88, is now on a journey to find peace with his shadow and i feel like that was me the beginning of my journey that was me trying to figure out who i was and who i am and now i've become more like the eye i become more
1102.23,1119.57, become more interested in except in the idea that my art and me are the same and as the beginning i showed you the way or who are you now i just said the great kind of you are you and
1119.78,1136.31, i enjoin and it's a great journey so every one please enjoy the a and celebrate that you are you call thank you very much
