464.88,467.16, things that animals do
467.7,472.8, one thing when you care for other lives as you learn an awful lot about death
473.22,557.37, and you learn you know you hear the old people and the tribes all over the world foretold death added you really come to understand and you really come to understand compassion and i think because i had so much compassion for my animals as what drew me to put it they teach you a true life lesson and to me personally i can look up into a field and i can look at an animal and i can tell you he's got a bruise on his big toe is right away i do a lot of fair trade for i have done a lot of fair trade work all over the world and i did not work it was to bet him people in the paladin now i'm actually working the sabioncello and again what is given me the strength to sit down with a family that has absolutely nothing atacavi lucky and the mother is very very ill or dies tuberculosis you got a premature baby there you know is going to die you have dirty drink in water no sanitary conditions but the people are happy they don't know when their food is coming next they're so happy and i think
557.85,579.75, i helped them as much as i can sometimes with money some lottie with deeds but i think learning from the animal learning the compassion from the animals is what's given me the strength to actually work with people some great fierce to a farm that will after thirteen months of a different perspective on life because she'll see what matters
580.14,606.6, see what she considered and she can see and get your hands dirty you can cherish life you can help support it you can feed feeding animals as so much fun because they're always brilliant least about it and not i i i when you have somebody's life in your hand notionate if it's a page or a chicken

609.48,616.68, actually i talk to my animals all the time and they respond and they understand
617.43,634.08, i been like constant graduate school that have animals all the time how to give an injection how to do could baby how to fail how to live with death you do become more sensitive and thoughtful and different ways now that i'm doing less far more i really really miss that

679.77,691.47, road that we traveled i think i could honestly say that we started off thinking that we was going to make money and then we do sell in love with the animals and
691.65,706.17, i didn't care about the money at a funny dimension to go back and think about what i did this again sure and i can say oh i do this tiensiert but every single spirit experience for good or ill builds up everything that you are and the world to live in
707.52,713.67, i can imagine leaving this place but i also have no idea what i would do with that because it's quite a big thing
