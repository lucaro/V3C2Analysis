15.0,17.73, father is from us from gala
17.79,18.9, and
19.05,21.12, i grew up in germany
21.42,38.58, and it was always interesting to be it for me to visit anyone and one of these travel i was interested in colonial history like in the architecture in connection to the to the surroundings and the
38.58,41.82, the architects of most present there is
41.88,53.85, the case of course and and everybody knows that the dutch were there and the english people were there british and parties
54.09,63.6, so i traveled and visited some of the castles and then there was one that i found in the name was coveleski was
63.81,71.28, wondering where this name comes from you know i figured out like okay could be german exile like
71.37,102.87, dutch but doonan german so but it's from the seventeenth century as a i was wondering how it came there so i made research and i found out that it's extreem the seventeenth century and oppression elector builded there which not so many people now i mean are some historians and like people that travel there who know about the sister but in general it actually landport in the german history so to speak
102.93,105.9, so the press elector
106.35,121.26, teevan he was he studied in doin in netherlands actually like the kings had very good connection and he had his education in the netherlands and the netherlands
121.35,123.84, the time of big 
124.02,128.13, for a big sea force overseas as well
128.19,157.05, and it was also like he wanted to um trade with a direct trade with the african continent so and not only always have to go through the netherlands or through partially in a secret mission he sent two boats to to explore where they could make contracts with the friendliest
157.95,161.1, and then they found this place 
161.28,164.46, this pontius
164.76,175.26, every house where they actually could find people to make that with so the end the castle was built then to
175.26,185.25, be there and the like all the goods were collected there and every few weeks when winship has by they could pick up
185.25,186.87, this good
187.26,191.52, by that time for also like
191.55,197.28, started with the slave trade and like there was gold i bore
197.34,205.41, of course also slaves loaded on the ship and then brought to the caribbean
205.44,207.39, a triangle
207.39,215.37, and then brought to the caribbean and then they went back to germany ought to pressure by that time we
224.7,252.03, the state didn't have money because there was a thirty years war right before and so what you do if you don't have money enough you you you you am i mean for of all they went to somewhere where they could get a man make a big business and like in that time there reconcilement there was big business to make
252.3,253.95, and
254.1,259.62, also to buy the ships and to finance the enterprise
259.68,277.17, had the north consonants call and it was actually the first stock company on german ground by the time it was not terminated was pressure by it what but was on german ground and nowadays it is truman
277.26,280.35, so early the first
280.59,282.48, some
282.51,295.77, germany was for this enterprise to go down sent the ships and start this triangle trade so i thought like it isn't interesting reference
295.77,298.47, well to my project like
298.62,315.21, which is called odd laugheth egeria and i created the eagle africa share is called standing german at logic attend with this with with this project the the share
315.3,318.33, you connect the participate
319.41,322.59, by donating you will
322.68,324.66, finance the project
324.96,339.99, i have a public i have public sponsor like the potensi that will be an exhibition it's already fixed in november in a crop and then i am also i also have private sponsors like this
340.26,343.02, the finance through the chairs
343.26,349.32, and participate the project as well so they will be the people who have been named and they will get
349.35,359.52, a share afterwards from from what i get out of the project and class it sure an interesting project
359.85,366.51, only historical wise and from the context it an art piece i mean it's printed edition
366.81,379.56, that you can actually buy but also on the side of amenartas investment in 
388.65,396.66, it is like to to bring this badinot in the german history to light
396.66,399.69, and for a man like
400.14,408.57, in them in the case of like the money flow or like let's say also
409.44,416.79, intention or attention is interesting for me as an artist like the
417.06,422.13, the more attention the more the project gets
422.16,424.32, the more i can do
424.92,429.78, and the more i can do the more successful it would be
430.14,441.03, and the more successful it will be it will be a whole exhibition like that would be followed eos insulations exhibited there and they will be brought back
441.12,444.84, sure as also to make
444.96,456.27, i mean you know it's not the main point but yeah you can there will be a profit out of it when i sell the outwork so by actually by buying the share
457.44,468.48, tension to my project like the less shares there are left the higher the price rises
468.54,469.92, the shares
470.01,471.06, and
471.06,473.82, the more i can do with the project
473.91,481.62, you know like so it's a win it can be a win win situation and that's my i mean that's my vision what
481.71,491.4, but on top of that you are just participating as well like this process of re wide riding the history in a
491.43,493.38, a certain way because
495.12,499.17, most of the histories to lost and
499.62,502.41, what is important for me as an artist
504.27,507.93, bringing the history to the present as well
522.48,526.11, history is always a
526.14,552.21, also a story like you know you you take the facts that you find and build a story with it like you and that some facts left and so it's like a clash like you can you can build you can play with it and you can tell stories with it and this is interesting also to use imagination shore
552.27,556.62, it's always use like a certain perspective
556.71,560.79, nation or a certain
561.06,565.77, it is often used a certain approach
566.43,571.98, the history so what what i use is actually that he
572.07,585.03, between and also the things that you that you cannot tell through facts i think art has a possibility like to explore or to approach from from also another angle you know
585.06,593.82, the historian also telling his story in other ways or asking questions to history i mean it's it's 
594.3,608.97, most of the things are forgotten shore and these not many facts that that are left but oh there are more facts and has more to tell than they are told and often its sole only from
609.03,610.68, a very
610.86,613.56, yeah very 
614.07,619.62, minded perspective so as this is interesting i think
619.8,627.87, also like the whole like the hagerman is involved or was involved
628.05,634.05, in the colonial partisans
634.47,636.0, forgotten
636.66,638.7, that is some
638.73,646.77, responsibility or some involvement that we now i say we as germans have
647.34,655.71, now to participate and we participate in the world history and that also before
