102.84,105.9, make a tool is such a great job
106.11,109.65, the life i wanted to do a really give me
109.74,112.17, and of pleasure and excitement
112.35,128.55, way to fulfill this of dreams to go to polish his school it was at that time he was only one school in arch so i worse applying something like six times to polish him school
128.79,133.8, would that the rest of the competition i never get the prize

161.04,166.68, always prepare it myself so i find myself national ischl and
166.74,168.06, at
169.05,170.43, a change
170.67,182.34, at agram new card what do you think it very nice
182.46,185.4, that pickup from the printers yesterday
185.55,198.87, that's one and the lettering is something called silly and braile is very cool baby but that's nothing attentively nice egg shell with emollient
200.7,209.31, missionaries billy as threepence pretty young water lasalle
209.73,220.41, this was the man who before i admire as a child watching them work and now suddenly become my colleagues
220.56,223.11, teacher was one morris
223.11,236.64, he cried huge one of the filled in the fifties and early early porters was like moles
236.85,244.2, farther on more and at that time when they were shooting the movie
244.29,247.2, i do was not
247.2,251.97, a decade later at the time were we were the
252.51,256.98, i stop which was in low sensitivity him stole
257.01,261.78, structure is festooned with small grain
263.07,271.26, every great which determinate house is it feasible that it has incredible
271.53,272.7, quality
273.57,277.17, we were shooting him months sixty mile
277.71,283.23, move on when you use the him tugging at thirty five
283.53,285.06, more
285.36,287.22, so it was kind of
288.75,298.41, give the quality which was close to professor but also in no we were privileged also to should move in thirty five million
298.59,301.5, this will be look almost like still
301.83,306.36, saturation of horror and resolution was incredible
306.42,308.52, so i start
308.88,312.51, using this festal
312.78,315.0, later professional
315.57,323.28, and i was in a way i was lucky at that moment with that when i have entered
323.28,325.86, should reservoir dogs
328.5,336.3, to quintanaroo this proposition to show this and
336.3,338.16, slowly he stole
338.85,340.26, which they
340.32,344.49, brace and it was one of the risen
345.0,347.52, they decided to give me
349.14,353.94, spite of i have very comparatively
355.14,357.42, small credit
357.42,361.98, to other cinematograph which uplifted job
362.31,373.11, it is pretended
373.59,380.31, i took my share and suddenly they respond went in one to meet me with me
380.46,382.11, unfortunately
382.8,394.98, earlier find out that my father died so i told quentin now listen i i go back to europe to california and if you give me life to airport
395.28,399.39, we could have interview it happened that it was clearly the moment
399.87,401.37, quintin
401.4,409.98, in the three foremen he give me life to her port and you know we will discuss and quintets
409.98,423.87, full of excitement was now filmer and the cries his traps going to be put on the train and i was an anemone all were excited how to grow on to this movie
424.8,427.17, so it was my really first
427.35,439.98, move the united states first major movie and at that time i didn't consider this major on because the budget was severely one half million dollar
440.58,447.63, it was the beginning the beginning i start working with her high caliber actors like a vital
447.96,460.2, he was very much on the way to become stanyon very formidable might manethe actors and i had to give to
460.59,466.65, credit to my technical because they were did prepare
466.95,471.0, straight the way go to set off
471.24,475.71, feel professional said and i was ready
476.1,481.8, so this is exactly i was observing
481.89,485.34, student here and this in school
487.26,502.53, i too have to learn as much as possible in the school because you never know where your chance arrived you really have to be read and not only read believed but you project
503.04,504.63, so
505.14,514.74, to employer to director to produce that you could continue shooting this and they feel safe in your hand
514.95,520.35, you are really the major creative person and the feet
520.53,528.12, i ignore a before but no wonder you ask your father i do
528.21,533.64, making a terrible mistake in not one like enemies body wants this
533.91,536.25, to
536.79,548.55, of course during reproduction it was kind of a lot of discussion about how we going to shoot and you have personalities they were costing idea how
548.76,556.47, how directly how he went to to look at this and he has his own idea about
556.5,565.11, i had to give you know huge credit to quentin was that he he was listening
565.56,574.05, and he was analyzing and his brilliant judgment of good way of feeling
574.08,575.79, so if
575.88,580.11, he has idea how he went to feel
580.32,582.99, what you want to tell
583.8,590.79, he also listened to to his colleagues to to his collaborator
590.97,599.13, i give one of example of the kind of cooperation is opening scene in resource
599.43,606.69, he is playing the music intellect which is very good quinientos this using stadium
608.16,612.9, tedious to go around around the people
613.14,618.15, the bunch of this war going to through this strait
618.42,625.26, by the infantine kind of idea because i go from the school and was
625.29,628.29, a national school that
628.95,631.23, come should not
631.38,635.34, i mean if you should not feel presence of camera
636.24,653.28, of course creatively you can someone could use this that you feel presses of camera but you had to be created decision otherwise should not be issued not exist so in our i simplify this and i give us example
654.63,659.31, the fine which is very simple tierrabona
659.82,670.68, this opening in over buzancais with four salute papa go to is the camera the arrival later
671.01,672.81, single just
672.84,675.27, choosing them as 
675.3,679.2, as collectors in the movie
679.5,758.64, so i exactly used this simple thing which was only associated with twopence i use in this resisters ion to quentin to show that way love grows where my rose mary god as gave billions of the seventies weekend just keeps on truck inarticulate
758.97,769.08, i was aiming for as was quality as was possible to lose cityfied sharp essares outin
770.46,774.45, color was more saturated
774.57,781.98, so yes it is much more difficult because everything seen you had to rely
782.82,793.26, so at the beginning i was and opposing his will sing him stockstill i started looking at the material i did with
793.35,795.87, if i stop
796.02,800.04, which is the final figure grain so therefore
800.1,808.08, bear there was allusion is is not as good it is not liberation
810.33,811.98, did
812.01,814.74, smaller pickerel
815.1,816.66, erotion
816.9,819.42, so small a grain
819.9,824.67, smaller lowestoft is beguelin
824.67,827.46, you shooting is much more difficult
828.03,834.66, because you had to bring more lights you had to live to set level of light were
834.93,838.53, i will respond to the image
838.92,839.91, because
840.0,843.24, moving around the big
843.27,846.69, to use it always take his
847.65,856.83, so he is to sing this restoration it demurred to prepare yourself
857.7,863.91, but pay office much apiece like later when you see
864.27,867.57, quality is extraordinary
867.9,873.6, course now in everything changed with in last few years because
874.5,884.88, dedicated became sugar and now getting even better so unfortunately can of fillettino now lost lost its grand
886.05,889.17, i myself while i look at
890.34,897.9, torontonians
898.44,907.47, a mother footprints estimates wallace who like
907.59,912.39, the field of digital camera is much bigger
912.69,921.06, so it's always advisable to work on lower lower stop
921.72,927.87, so what they do they put out a lot of aloof you know neutrality filters in front of
928.02,930.9, and to cut it down
931.89,947.91, so the sensitive she is in camerarius about four hundred or eight hundred a cassowary very high use at the time when i start more care is unheard to shot like a
948.39,950.76, i say into
951.54,957.66, not compromise the quality because straightway the greater was huge
957.99,965.22, was not probing but is the problem when this impacted in the rain
966.72,981.87, you know the great was as because oranges and of course a beginning and no i was complaining and staring orbs never did till be as as her but as his progress you had to embrace this
981.99,983.52, because
983.61,998.07, because he was technology where used to be a mighty wind was much younger and i used to this and i lalage but now i faced a new nointel
998.31,1006.74, it for sure is much easier is it better for people who decided to
1007.64,1018.68, make correlates is much better but also in give them more challenge the competition is much bigger than poor of people who using
1018.89,1026.63, images much bigger than i used to be so this is the challenge for this new people yes is easier
1026.66,1028.94, you have bigger competition around
1029.21,1045.14, so dey using as much as supposed to be white lens so of course we using wide lands you you just expand you know you see much more had to let the said so once again using big unit
1045.29,1049.37, it helping you very much but also
1050.21,1065.21, i could do that the short white short close up or a close abusing white house is just you move comerford of course you had to be very kind of sensitively if if you have to ride out
1065.24,1069.71, you go to close you could create that you could create
1069.74,1079.37, distortion and distortion and stars or actor faces not that is not particular welcome but it's really
1080.45,1082.31, beneficial
1084.17,1087.17, showing in one short
1087.59,1093.74, for example close up also environment and which the actor is placed
1093.8,1101.33, is that terminate but what kind of story telling what kind of is the man to do in this story
1101.6,1104.54, sometimes you know we
1105.47,1109.79, is the way to go sometimes whitest
1110.42,1116.84, i have to be designed during production when you take the scriptural you read this
1116.9,1124.49, you feel this what kind of how you want to tapestries side of the story
1125.3,1127.64, no problem yes
1128.12,1129.77, a more emotion
1130.49,1132.68, in children nine
1133.13,1135.77, i went for the world should be coming directly
1136.79,1138.08, into 
1138.2,1140.69, do you feel better mother flung
1140.84,1144.98, the negro that's all you had to say
1146.06,1153.95, i find that most of them that they are very operated they want to be i know they know what the will they do in
1153.95,1159.98, he scored experience after a most of his orders 
1159.98,1163.01, very much a world of color
1163.76,1166.7, it is so called acting for cover
1166.82,1188.18, they know exactly they know exactly what comrades do they know less they very often ask me what these how it is and they ask no one is day or that a white or close and you know i tell you you are his close ups wiedersehen exactly what were they doing
1188.54,1197.81, in the know the using for the advantage for example in the patrol and the one to stress the drama
1197.96,1204.53, the acting so that the shifting their body and the getting hit with a harder light
1204.62,1217.64, and some actor you know very old stars that they had cooeperative me little bit more light so that couldn't be kind of pop more
1217.67,1221.72, this particular sin so talkative
1221.78,1228.77, sometimes i give them sometimes i don't i pretending that i give me it more life because
1228.95,1231.56, i have to keep all
1232.49,1238.91, control over their line because maybe that libidine which they demand may be a little bit too much
1239.06,1247.49, so we have to be ready recreantly orientated and used always to have to
1247.88,1251.63, a way that is advantage to image
1252.2,1261.29, i live in the american gardens building on westmestre on the alemoor my name is patrick balan
1261.44,1277.61, years old i believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise in the morning if my face is a little puffy i'll put on a nice pack while doing my stomach crunches
1277.73,1283.49, i can do a thousand now 
1283.58,1290.42, he
1292.13,1309.11, you read the great very carefully you can make not about the kind of atmosphere would you want to get of course out of discussion with direct what they want to how you going to to feel if committing in
1309.83,1316.19, after that you go to a location you arising what you have on your face the problem
1316.82,1321.47, you feeling the set which production design i prepare you
1321.92,1329.42, is government but his great deity to choosing colour how pietist shade
1329.42,1331.16, you have to
1331.19,1338.06, and to relate the sad which contribute had in making looks even better
1338.66,1347.36, tonwich move you do if you do kind of like period more or any other movie you you making kind of research
1347.39,1351.17, in looking at other movie looking up
1351.35,1365.09, painting looking at other art works capture they are cold of analyzing these because it is could contribute you i know you director the just bring me kind of completely
1365.6,1369.98, he loved material and these showing me and decent
1370.04,1375.29, in this but to analyzing and to bring the same atmosphere
1376.34,1382.43, carbon of you know strange coloration to to look look
1382.52,1383.93, like that
1384.14,1388.13, some you had to to
1388.34,1392.3, look like carbutt practisin kind of armor
1393.02,1404.75, something else happened like shaft of light from the sun and some some other thing or actors play differently that you assume they will
1405.05,1417.17, you had to take the advantage of that and one of these words i don't know any too remember watching is one long track and corridor
1417.47,1424.58, for someone jackson and the going to assassinate this boy in the role
1425.15,1427.73, the corridor was very long
1430.7,1434.63, we would timing the amount of the
1435.14,1436.46, in
1437.03,1439.52, the dalgarno
1439.55,1442.4, long much longer than the truck
1442.85,1445.37, so when they arrived to the door
1446.27,1449.81, they continue at the door to
1449.96,1456.26, to continue the conversation to be kind of boring you go to normal kind of coverage
1456.56,1458.15, so
1458.27,1464.69, we get to idea acquittal to extend the work
1465.02,1480.89, not by manewaring slower but when they arrived to the door they looking at her watch and then suddenly okay still will have time and they go to right side of the friend and come up pancrates of rain
1480.92,1482.72, coretti
1482.87,1495.77, walking away they have conversation in a further away americana the returning back the ablution eration on the door and now entry
1495.98,1501.38, in this pining life we gain much more part
1502.13,1514.82, no i love overysel because at that moment i could judge judge my work and make sometimes small adjustment because during operating
1515.18,1532.85, when you are stick to your finder nothing else exists except except the image of this you know soulmate people looking looking left ride on this instrument the lighting or anything else or
1532.97,1537.23, it doesn't distract you choosing what the later your
1537.38,1545.09, to continuance show more initiative to push this staff
1545.63,1548.51, to be under service to student
1548.72,1558.41, how you do this that he not only guiding you but the guys who the experts could you give you advice
1558.89,1568.13, second to work as much as possible the advantage of equipment make mistakes and learn from the misty
