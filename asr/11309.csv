167.64,170.64, it is all apparatus the medical empire
170.79,174.24, the transaction is a medical part
184.77,188.13, and inimical aspire
191.37,196.71, she's talking about sort of all the medical institutions procedures which facilitate
196.83,203.37, sensation but is also connected to other things like psychiatry like college and so forth
203.46,207.09, agamenticus he thinks it's a college

212.7,217.29, going on here which are the metallurgical procedures at the state
218.37,220.59, kind of mental transition
220.74,223.71, why why i have this
223.74,234.66, we have this primary to respond to people who are deviating from the actual treaty is well okay so we can sort of censure
235.35,239.07, for many a sexual effectively by changing her body
239.43,240.63, right

251.46,252.99, a boy
259.41,263.34, she is the medical compare as a way sort of
263.34,265.29, supporting
265.8,267.51, sexual system
270.51,273.69, adjust to things to have been more
278.82,283.77, that sort of work possition confinement
285.27,287.82, also you know
289.14,293.4, sieges that you know that when we have the kind of
293.46,296.76, conspiracy as patriarch
297.06,301.89, getting rid of women and replacing them with sort of madeleine
304.14,306.93, complete the work faster
309.78,311.4, but
311.55,318.96, poisonous one last out there this kind of picture that the gap
319.05,322.86, he then is a part a criticism
323.97,325.44, manoel
327.33,331.05, and she's worried about the macleods for a lot of
331.74,332.91, for reasons
332.91,340.77, the manitou is work holding on to system when she thinks will be on to his gard of his system
341.91,345.03, other issues right caused involves
345.57,348.36, surgical procedures performed in the body
348.48,354.69, on really is kind commitment to integration the integrity she seemed his violin
354.96,358.11, violating the bodies national integrity
358.17,361.29, so of technological surgical intervention
362.1,363.93, yet something genuinely
363.93,366.93, i insisted to
367.17,368.52, flintergill
376.26,378.51, also i think
378.6,380.82, reason were about
382.26,394.53, model of identity that is sort of line with somewhat of rietfontein important on his hand wisewit natural for her to want to oppose his model
394.95,404.1, think about it then the way which transtulit his friend is in terms of the idea of an vying generosity
405.54,407.91, i always know that i was
409.14,410.46, woman
410.67,412.56, early in our
414.87,417.45, sort of locks down the idea
420.87,424.29, the sanogene atoms in early
428.79,435.33, you did have a few this is accomplished really goes for the view of that offered by john money
436.92,439.5, seatmate or
440.73,442.83, a generation
444.15,445.59, article
445.95,448.41, the only livery early age
450.06,454.35, for his position to as it was it acquire a general
454.86,458.91, messala maybe porticos tion to
459.0,463.71, which language learned that on the 
464.01,467.91, but the idea that up until uneager to
468.21,469.68, can
470.37,472.8, depending upon how you were
473.16,476.76, that the generation
476.91,478.41, it was money said
478.44,484.77, after a particular and that i only get walked on becomes a revocable at become right after
486.6,489.42, civitella but
491.04,497.31, it also says that the general denies the track social rule
497.79,499.77, a sort of given
500.82,505.83, you're going to have to have a gender identity and the further for the anaconda
506.28,508.83, very early to captain
509.04,511.71, i want you why this might be a proper
514.32,516.36, she was a problem
521.52,523.74, so
525.69,529.29, think about mannion
529.41,532.8, remember here the idea that identity can be changed
533.58,537.39, the whole eleven supper project is about
539.16,541.92, in identities that
542.16,550.65, women have this sort of male sauntered identity is masculine and identity and this can be changed
552.12,554.91, no identities can be created
556.14,558.6, this can happen beyond the age of 
559.98,562.74, this can happen much later
562.83,564.93, i don't are not fixed
566.76,571.35, he can be changed is essential the essentials of the lesbians upperscote
571.53,574.62, a woman away from a man i detest identity
575.01,576.54, getting rid of that
576.81,581.97, and developing you know trying to form a identified i don't
589.14,597.42, the man the medical model for the withering memory so in the name chaperoning up the selection
597.42,601.62, in suffrages intensified chance
602.01,608.1, and you doolooboorah the niece calls the medical empire
608.79,618.27, this is i think one of the main reasons that right in allusion assiniboines ally commenced to the fact that there is going to be a generality
619.71,624.81, the necessarily so to minister to a generous
625.47,630.6, now i can be very well with one of his other two with his good to be one
631.62,635.52, you can go radicalism there would be no such idea to 
639.48,644.49, it seems that have this past commitment or of
646.23,648.06, the sexual system
650.49,652.92, i actually see what she's got it
656.16,659.34, obviously miss important to sort of note
659.34,666.6, the radiates critics of this sort of medical model though ultimately may be made by strangers
670.8,678.06, that you know so it still comes on to the insane expectations are of dismal or that
678.24,681.69, you matterson a friend of one
683.52,685.29, she is a
686.22,690.54, reciprocated she's back in canada
692.16,699.69, and as melologue right that transactions are counties in ontario the cart or antique
702.54,703.44, and
703.62,706.08, she showed up for whatever interviews
706.47,707.85, that
708.21,710.97, of like dominant laws
712.14,713.73, the reaction was
714.21,715.98, that won't do
717.21,718.89, she
719.16,720.18, as
722.76,726.87, you think that you're going to have what you think that you're trying to actual
728.52,730.44, for answer was well
730.59,734.49, a woman in trieste way that women dress
737.4,738.87, that
739.68,752.79, that won't do i misshaped the sort of really good of blow it out and stood a lion do it in a cistertian the botan many contacts and intensifies
757.41,758.67, he is
758.91,763.98, methinks of ten paces are also wainwright of
764.13,768.09, performance is being undulated through the medical
768.09,775.32, model right or into get access to surgeries you have to perform a particular kind of them any
776.61,782.43, one kind of you know he inobservance
783.66,784.53, so
785.19,789.63, intimately the teaching is that no
790.38,799.29, certainly changed in some places over time that this model required the optic of exceptions sterical behavior
801.57,803.73, from a dominion of view
805.11,807.21, really deeply
813.57,824.73, also all this is happening you know at a time when there is a lot of them in his critique you know philohela corollaries of the acadians try
824.91,826.95, which seem as
827.28,828.69, as
828.99,830.25, up
830.85,834.09, against them the women in their place
834.78,837.78, and then you have you have all this stuff about you know
838.26,842.31, as to want to work or how could you possibly feel unfulfilled
842.7,852.51, how this lovely tacatou know like that rebaiting and they would be happier if he were home
852.6,857.76, aliande think that i think that the agaric
857.82,859.86, the work that happening is
860.19,861.96, his memories
862.23,864.6, he suddenly 
865.8,869.31, a part of you know a mode of life
869.94,873.03, transformed botheration commensurate
875.07,878.76, my word about that sort of beseeching that we can
879.99,884.79, entirely untinged to conform to our dividual norms of drop
887.94,889.29, it part of 
897.09,900.9, you see why ravenouillet served by this
902.34,906.6, particularly given to this the framer of pitching from
908.49,913.17, sievers
915.96,918.18, he
919.65,921.87, their idea the
927.18,929.19, forced to do this
930.51,932.25, so
934.56,937.26, then for five minutes
937.74,939.24, and there also
939.84,947.91, so we do beseech relegated get a sort of infiltration the ovipositor whose invading
947.97,950.1, there is this you know you know
950.16,955.29, stoner about attempt access because bitterness right
955.41,957.9, the oppositions are also
958.02,961.98, sisterkin of burying the broader four
962.67,966.03, and of point to some of the ways in which
967.92,970.53, something that she said is right now
971.49,973.44, i say is this
976.59,980.22, but i had to pardon
980.25,982.14, bunol
983.76,985.53, problems
988.11,994.83, sidenote or is obvious in taking up the line tremendous
994.98,997.8, sleepless hard to like walk through
999.18,1000.44, in which
1000.62,1007.88, another way i mean that i haven't you know even talked about the set i mean this is important
1007.94,1015.65, an important to bring that one for her final by buchanan she means me to female transept
1016.16,1022.01, a transcendentally topological
1022.85,1032.18, she thinks that this is primarily as an omen on applies to malinda on happy with the sexual
1036.56,1045.26, she is a wild deer certain cases right that which we do see females for individuals access in this
1045.86,1051.2, then they are the exception to the rule and that that phenomenon
1051.86,1058.67, mainly serves the purpose of obscuring sort of the true function of the unsexual empire
1061.37,1065.96, pasmore to make it seem like it soloviev one
1065.96,1068.42, really is about
1068.87,1070.85, about individual
1073.37,1076.13, in some of these sir
1080.51,1081.83, so
1083.06,1087.05, basically accusing malady
1087.5,1090.8, beside me body
1090.89,1092.69, a person of
1092.78,1094.16, upon
1094.22,1096.77, for reformation
1096.95,1101.36, racing imitates
1102.65,1104.66, drop off the radar
1104.72,1110.96, and this beatrice as he aficionados in which
1111.11,1112.79, what's happening is
1112.94,1114.29, a
1117.38,1121.07, aileen are being converted into men
1121.22,1124.55, being sometimes a lease to the search
1124.73,1126.62, ventana way it is
1126.74,1131.27, problematic allasame patients really going on here
1133.85,1136.4, that this is a male controlled
1136.4,1138.17, in
1138.44,1140.66, a body individuals
1144.74,1151.31, interesting sentence i got a boat
1151.4,1155.24, what about like women and plaisance often
1155.27,1157.67, the lianhan
1157.73,1164.21, i formerly potencies so sometimes she belinda of my
1164.78,1168.17, the scientific part about
1168.44,1177.65, cowardlike alienated she just peter tatters and i felt that legitimate she does make some interesting
1177.68,1181.94, umbrellas
1182.45,1184.55, were france
1186.53,1189.41, they still had a pelisse still
1189.41,1190.85, kind of like
1191.3,1193.25, i construct women
1196.43,1199.1, it secures
1199.13,1202.91, the installation in a ball
1203.78,1208.34, and to the candidates falcone women
1209.33,1213.38, i think you're right about this it is where actinolite
1216.47,1219.11, talk about be coveting
1220.58,1222.89, at
1224.57,1233.78, do rifle and increased for isolation what is it what is this you know encase on your view
1234.26,1236.0, right 
1237.2,1239.99, they mean that it's kind from the central
1240.92,1243.56, which issue should would be celebrating it
1245.27,1247.13, it's kind o
1247.4,1251.24, national place inherit in the too people 
1251.84,1256.16, which is it guilty of a kind of biologist thank you are a sort of life
1256.73,1258.44, intricate
1260.48,1266.0, and so where does this fountain of the things we're getting a together
1266.45,1275.9, like this to a definite line woman is and i think the booming that becomes like the false part of this
1278.9,1287.69, i tentativeness they have been addressed by some of the charleses link
1288.14,1303.44, i like to get a sense of the cold here like or reminiscence the way the knowledges are being constructed about like certain pains but unresisting like hers off on slave boy renunciation will not a random pentelicus really retention of like
1305.09,1311.39, i think that part like like lonesomeness to plan as contentedly
1311.42,1314.45, the incapacity
1317.18,1321.2, archie
1321.32,1325.25, now these male bonnele so i mean i think so
1325.31,1328.94, the issue that i think that when she consents
1331.13,1336.41, athenian she accepts this distinction between sort of like but alligator
1336.95,1343.28, accepted by rotation to aemilia when she worries about male body shown his face
1343.94,1349.46, seems a lot i bring about the morning the bombay showing up on the rostrum
1350.33,1356.09, he's actually bought into natural attitudes he's pointing that she sort of life
1357.29,1359.93, the natural attitude was
1362.09,1365.51, you one of the things i was one of the things
1366.47,1374.78, i want to bring what i think though asininities tenement
1374.78,1379.04, there is a tide arisaig problem
1382.31,1392.21, i got to it i want explain what happens with sandstone and then politics for generally these abysmal
1392.84,1397.88, you should go by what happens is this is taken up and stones are full
1400.1,1403.97, often assumed in the kind of elise query studies
1405.23,1407.27, dissentient
1407.48,1411.77, get it or of a denial of the sex genetic ion first of all
1413.33,1416.54, there is any kind of substrate
1418.52,1421.4, the casement writes all gender
1424.13,1425.63, i acted
1425.63,1430.31, then you get this idea of and our sewing a strict binary
1432.8,1434.21, i also wrong
1437.27,1439.43, it is too too unmade
1439.58,1443.24, and with subject position
1443.24,1446.54, have chapple basically position
1446.66,1449.0, all with respect to the finer
1454.7,1460.85, he
1464.3,1470.9, nineteen
1478.37,1480.98, chance people
1481.34,1485.75, trisystem
1486.56,1490.1, eunane that there is a second estacion
1490.82,1496.88, it's higher different model of sex gender that is deployed different vision of gender
1500.75,1503.63, i also mentioned also
1503.78,1506.51, this queer informed
1507.44,1509.18, as model
1509.78,1513.47, give up imaginary kind
1513.8,1515.87, for to
1516.71,1519.44, altringer
1524.36,1531.17, statistically that no chance edition and turned in her politics and we end up with
1531.35,1533.51, a new paradigm
