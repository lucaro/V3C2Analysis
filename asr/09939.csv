0.57,34.23, name's patrick milligan i'm a h student at the university of florida and i work in the litany and i study interactions between ants and trees and how they are affected by an invasive and species from ethiopia
35.46,46.68, though i kept the plateau is about a mile high area in kenya where the savannas are dominated by a single acacia
46.71,93.96, species and this tree is really dominant because it can partner with native and species which protected from large or before and in exchange for that protection the ants received shelter and nectar from the tree there are four species of native and that live on the occasion trees three of them are from the genus comatic after one is from the genus tatiana but all of them have the ability to sting a large herbivores that try to attack the tree and they can also release alarm fair amount into the air when a hen elephant or a draft comes along in the tried to rip off a brander eat some leaves
94.29,108.45, at that are near that spot will spray the fairmont the air the ants then bent together and swarm the animal that is attacking the tree they can even sting the inside of an elephant's trunk and scare that elephant away
109.11,139.77, the big headed and is listed by the international union of the conservation of nature as one of the one hundred worst invasive species in the world there really effective at colonizing tropical and subtropical systems and when they move into an area they killed many of the native insects there and the especially are good at praying on native hands species we noticed in the past ten or fifteen years that this aunt has invaded the kipple and they
139.77,152.64, directly affect the ants that live on those occasions trees when the big headed ants invade an area and remove the native ants from that tree they then take up residence at any
152.7,179.1, they don't provide the protection that i need if occasion colony would when in a case loses its ant colony it can try to make up for that in a few different ways the response that i actually look at with my research is how the tree changes its foot synthesis i use the like or list four hundred portable photosynthesis meter which allows me to clamp a censor on to indicate
179.16,207.09, then i can tell me the rate of photosynthesis those going on in that least based on the chemical reactions and products involved in photosynthesis by studying the photosynthetic rate in invaded occasions and comparing it to areas that have not yet been invaded i'm able to determine if those trees are altering their physiology to make up for the negative effects of invasion the main question that
207.33,209.16, find my ph is
209.46,245.7, what are the functional effects of this biological invasion and how do the changes to the occasion trees cascade to effect other species in this area i often call like iamblichus while for second home because i have become really attached to the ecosystem there and the people that live there there is this really beautiful harmony between the cattle ranchers and the conservationists and the scientists that live in this area where everyone is very conscious of
245.7,265.89, their own welfare is tied to the environment and so they work together to try to find the best solution to not only understand those species interactions but how we can preserve them for the future
