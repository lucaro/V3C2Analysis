0.87,7.5, here you can see i'm opening up the can snap it doesn't take up much room when it's closed up
7.59,9.3, i
9.36,10.59, so
11.19,64.8, it's always on so i didn't need to turn it on and i'm taking my journal which i have had the binding cut off on the justing the wit and i am clicking well i'm closing it properly and then unliking start it doesn't it's not bothered by the weight of the coverage a start scanning up both sides of every page automatically into an octave pitfour masking and then you can see it opens it up automatically on my screen i didn't do this and in showing me the pages as they scanned castitate other option is to scan each page separately as its own capehart useful and i've
65.25,84.06, for my sort of file folders and so on i used the pegs extensively but for something like a journal i rather scant into pets i can search in it later so my journal is done that took about a minute 
84.42,123.36, scant napes going to open up i could probably have set this to just go right to drop box but i'm new enough with this that i like to look at the screens so here i vote and up the scant snap organizer and there my sixty page pedanius on take a quick look at it i have that set to open in skane snap not a peiffer although i could have done that instead so i'm just checking that my pages are there and sonance this up
124.23,146.49, and back on scan snap i'm getting ready to drag my penitent the drop o falderal that's what i did and it comes up and what attacking me is in blue there you know to give a name for my file so i am going to name it
146.61,154.23, i could use that history but if i had recently named something in a similar manner
154.59,188.4, then the next thing i have to say is where do i want this to go out again i could have used the history button to look at folders i've recently used but i'm just going to find it new and on the fly on just going to make a brand new sub folder for this journal and i'm going to name that and then that is selected so i'm going to say okay and now you can see it's giving me the file path right there i click to save an it's all done
