0.0,146.55, there are more than four thousand aircraft park here the boneyard taken together these plains would make up the second largest air force in the entire world but most of these plains will never fly again they're here to serve a different purpose for the boneyard is where the air force and every other us government agency since their decomposing airplanes to be taken apart refused in other aircraft or turned over to the defense realization of marketing office to be sold as scrapehem process of amargosa to extract the very last tax dollars from these aircraft after they reached the end of their useful operation lives it's a mission that's been helping save taxpayers money since the end of world war two shortly after the second world war there were huge quantities entertained mercatores more successfully than others so a lot of them are rapidly outstation runs a aircraft were brought here for reclamation like eftsoone a lot of twenty nine were stored here after world war two and they were pressed back into service for creasote sisters principally in air force facility the maintainer own facility philpott was closed up i think i lose
147.3,430.71, storage facility for government aircraft so you find massa aircraft over there you find coast guard aircraft borderer navy marine reserving in its training units we have a lot of nicaea here a lot of one of the kinds are few of the kinds behind us here there's a beatrice maker it's specialisation one ever built by fortifications warranting the cold war america's determination to outpace the soviet union in the space race helped fuel and explosion of technological advancement almost as quickly as they were introduced us military aircraft were regularly phased out as near aircraft in faster hitter the outmoded airplanes were sent here and the boyards inventory began to swell with the vietnam war came a renewed call for even more advanced bombers and fighters by the time that war started to wind down in nineteen seventy three the boards fleet had reached an all time high more than six thousand aircraft to day some four thousand aircraft still sit in the board various stages of the regulation process but the inventory here much like in today's air force is destined to change you know as our air force and evermore and more technologically reliant fernie types of airplanes are being produced i would expect probationary years there may not be a need for such large facility there always be a ethereality but whether or not erinaceus one thirty five or salsafette in the world anybody who can is interested in amatorial if you mention two son interleaved reason turns out the desert climate here in two san provides an ideal environment for long term storage of these aircraft with very little risk of corrosion or other damage from the elements the ground were on here is fairly unique it's it's a very high helsingoer stable wantin it's as hard as concrete and very very very robust and with the dry weather conditions here now relative humidity around very low rainfall averages reclamation facility and that year round sunshine also makes this an ideal location for people to come visit and experience air force history in person normally when someone wants to get a good look at some military aircraft they have to do it through binoculars but here at the boneyard you can get up close and personal with everything from writers farmers tankers lifters just about everything the air force is flown in the last half century are visitors almost universally in joy the sense of entrecote in the desert to look at airplanes we don't wake of our airplane
431.49,476.73, so it's not all just about tearing down all aircraft as newer technology makes them obsolete preserving your force history has become like a secondary mission at the ponyard along with the puma errand space museum right across the street amager as a sort of monument to the accomplishments and innovations of the past hoping to inspire america's future pilots aircraft engineers and astronauts next generation of aerospace innovators for all you know can be wandering around here this week end getting that whiff hydraulic fluid if we can expose and encourage young people to come out and challenge themselves and find a direction through what we do here however little i think it's important work
477.15,486.54, time and technology march on the boneyard will continue in its mission taking custody about dated aircraft salvaging and reusing every part possible
486.54,495.72, except for the small handful of aircraft that are preserved for posterity once a certain model of jet fighter or a helicopter or long range bomber is gone
495.78,561.42, gone forever a calling this conception a lot of people have with a mark is that they're still world war aircraft over there if we more often than you think we know we do get emails or phone calls from people doing family history haelsingland fathers be twenty four still parked across the street and left general explained to them now and afraid not a miniature into beer cans probably sixty years ago so the idea the apple have a boatswain place where nothing happens at system big you know now what some ill billy far in the middle terhune old tracks in the santiago
