124.08,177.63, one day bananas dad said out on a hike up a tall mountain then was five years old and to him this hike felt like an endless quest to a non existent summit band was not happy the two hadn't gotten very far when they stopped to rest under a small tree bends father began to weave a tail to encourage men to keep moving in the story there was a castle in a far away land and a fire breathing dragon and the hero of the story was a small boy who set out on fantastic adventure and met many interesting characters the story will bend to move his weary legs for with each step more of the story was revealed finally the story was done and benoni dead had reached the top of the mountain
178.71,180.21, the fascination
180.24,181.68, the medium
182.43,221.64, my mother gave me a book a tiny book of shadows really opened up a new world for me by merely holding up my hands in a certain way i can create people or animals and really bring my stories to life so i decided i should go find others who were like me had a passion for puppets as the years went by

285.24,297.57, all john needed was a puppet and a story once again ben was awestruck by how this mysterious man could breathe life into something so simple
297.9,302.13, the wisdom of a friend hoping to understand her
302.43,365.97, this so later on that night i was listened to my friend applys guitar now nat a pretty smart fellow and for a moment i saw the path i was on and the strange journey of stout take the puppet is given life by this very organic process of the puppeteer designing republic creating it and then the ideas behind it become more crystallized the puppet materializes as this sort of thing outside of you that also contains part of you and it's a very accessible part you can make a puppet out of anything you can make it out of wood out of paper mache you could make it out of the scraps of metal can make it out of a song they really doesn't matter it can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be but it always always a part of you to create something that moves with your bodies with your voice that tells a story of your creation its
366.33,368.34, absolutely phenomenal feeling
369.69,450.81, apart making soup it is easy all you need our socks magersfontein duly faces head stopping a response of yarn worked great safety pins used to help keep your puppet and shape and help attach excess or how about a hat or glasses about i use your imagination let's begin o your socks are clean a smelly sack makes for milly puppet place your hand in the sack with the stuffing over the knuckles then in berthelot the pocket formed by our fingers using your other hand to help form the mouth cavity now you are ready for facial features margarot and get color let's take a moment to learn some basic hand techniques hold your thumb and forefinger in a relaxed mouth formation the common mistake among amateur socrates as to slap the top fingers radically to make the petal this looks awkward making it appear that the top of the head is moving while the lower jaw remained stationary instead imagine there is a string attached to your palm pulling it straight outward
451.23,471.93, maintain the illusion that the lower jaws moving while keeping the top of the head stationary now you are ready to experiment with your public just a little handle goes a long way it is amazing what you can do
472.41,490.98, we desperate learn more than hit the road searchers like him
492.96,539.67, at that creature good to do this missus bates all right i'm going to reflect on your last visit a little bit you know but i'm going to change it around a lot all right you know i do not mean you'll be able to follow oratorios that you see is only met to day you know and you

895.05,917.88, the frog town mountain properties have been performing for over ten years they shine a light on the finer points of puppet presentation there is nothing like family
917.88,954.18, a pleasure to work every day with this a lot of people out there that say they couldn't work with family at all but an we get along real well i mean you definitely annoyed by your simlinses endearments and the pastor would wake everyone up by blasting
954.21,973.5, and in the morning oh yes like the sound of that but in a tide so we want to go see the old man once and he was playing in portland so brian thought if we made a nelson puppet and set him up it was sold out so of course and then we
973.56,974.64, set up
974.64,985.44, little stage out front on the steps and started loosening telamon songs and turned out of the course of the night songs like his like like mentionin

1078.29,1121.46, i have we often have to trade voices as it sometimes there been dependent what character you have walking in what time i'll be stuck without having him on my hands and bryanston one eye and he's got a really good at like a postcard talking is one i like iranistan cameronians and onesime on a black mare so he can't conaille my words and so we it's really that's a great thing about puppies being behind the curtain as a lot of things you can do other you can do you can to normal theater you stefan that is a good estimate when i mean he's got it learning by actual lines with his men sometimes when specialties go wrong
1121.79,1131.18, kind of going with whatever is going on so i just start talking he somehow knows how to keep the idiot's coming achilleion

1207.65,1209.21, shadows
1209.24,1225.35, havana is was for show at the castanares as one thing that i like about the publication is it's a very traditional design is designed to look like a
1225.35,1237.38, a wooden puppet of we use still tear casting materials and light weight forms so the thing is actually much more expressive of much more light and much more durable
1237.38,1274.13, perhaps the original would be back in the day to nice blending of old nowadays see my keys i have them they have little plush octopus them out never mind about them to me a puppet is really a
1274.13,1278.84, a distillation of character public is only built to be
1278.93,1283.13, character and nothing else is only built to move
1283.13,1294.59, in a way that that character means to move and there is literally nothing else to the puppet except the character which is you know one of the great things about poetry as when you watching a puppet show
1295.07,1319.07, watching the character and your you as an audience member are investing you are your donners giving life to this character as much as the puppeteer is because the audience is is believing this is real it though it's gittin the thing that i know is not alive is alive and thinking so in a lot of ways i feel like you know a puppet is supposed to do less than a person can do
1319.07,1325.46, but but in that it offers a clearer picture of about
1325.46,1340.4, in doing only a certain number of things you pay attention to what the certain things are now i really think with helen ultimately you know in the exploration of this documentary as if he were to become a public himself
1341.48,1346.28, that would be it would probably be the best way to explore the medium
1347.63,1350.18, fuzzy from the inside out
1350.18,1361.46, or whatever materials money to use better ostentatious this papistic it's a start the set's a starter
1366.11,1404.0, begins to see puppets where there were no puppet before every object transformed into a thing and the thingness imbued them with life then realizes that everything and anything can become a puppet 
1411.14,1422.15, our hero approaches the mysterious beast
1422.21,1428.93, at any moment it would strike and then it does

1464.99,1503.27, performances by bread and puppet theatre and a puppet cabaret with a lot of interesting performers it'll bring together puppeteer and people who write about appeased like seems to me any way that one of the interesting challenges of puppet theater in terms of scholarly pursuits is that there are so many ways different ways to think about about puppets from a theatre history angle or sort of straight puppet theater history which is a pretty narrow field but also anthropology which has looked at the globe
1503.57,1526.4, aspects of poetry since the mid th century and sanatan phenomenology and a couple of other ways of looking at this the manipulation of objects as performance so i'm excited that will kind of see what other people are doing penal
