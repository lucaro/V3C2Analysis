20.04,48.21, i am adam i worked with the camerons and we decided that erfurt discussion to day on lysis thing that comes to mind for me with lineament of them and why are they simeuse they require a lot less energy so why is it so important to be located or you're not going to have this manifesto setting reconnut up five six lights if you like
48.24,119.16, when you're on a typical shoot so do you want to longarone all these lights or do you want to have a nice small pack into three four lights that can offend one case their light weight their battery powered to a move from one location to next quickly you're going to light a lot more as a result the second most important thing would be probably longevity you're not dealing with filaments so with an allied is going to last a lot longer and it can handle a lot more were in her now i think ledesma bad rap in the beginning because they were very limited one temperature control and just the overall quality of life it was coming out of them one of the biggest complaints was in this kind of a greenish tone so that kind of tintoretto of these mines and one that will talk about is this no one can that are in made that this one that we have here is caught in all seven deaths becomes to change the temperature and you also lochan these huge saturation it incredible wortheton can do so talk about that and a little bit so it's about some of the different limelight that are around here right now what a morning my hand is the first company that really started making
119.19,159.24, a lot of these lads for the industry and this one is light panels and problem the most mobile one that we have it doesn't have a tablet it does have a dim but control and you cannot change the temperature on this one now a lot of the other ones are a man i've gotten to a point that you can change to saturation pretty much all and whatever you need temperature wise which is pretty incredible and the other thing is nice is there all coming on right the imishologu the one cartwright now we are about at fifty per cent intensity so i'm going to just dalliance see what the setlagoli all away up
160.08,179.01, and that therefore power it there and take a back down to have so were fifty six right now there's a wide range
179.79,199.71, sweeter so can actually bring out greens and bring up when gentian if i can one but now we are into hume nicandre get crazy so i'm going to actually turn it up ticket
200.1,249.12, so this is drastic i mean this is like putting any jolt you could possibly come up with between this and then you can still also dollington and you can see it's just a lot of possibilities would really interest me as i find something that may be monotonous these lights and their smaller they run on the battery is one in the key one is a fill of back light sometime highlight for example in this table right now amusing an actual punctilio but you know it would be nice if i could have the multiplies i can really start creating and dynamic scene minus crab this royalist and this is like panels it's a one by one the flood now this only does thirty two hundred 
249.12,297.48, in terms of temperature you can't do that but you can see you can adjust its intensity and it around and running on just a little dynamic which is made by a inordinately so much a high light as a as a specific role and both photography and film making and it tottering light and i'm sure you've heard of it till it's not pretending light if you have it like going to give you the whole story about it but i'll say this this comes with a mouth that you can put wordsworth mill rods to it it will basically goat now your camera is set up and it's going to sit right there and usually got to be using this first aria where you have a beautiful girl in front of you and you just on her face to looward by a diana
297.93,309.0, these are made by rosco and i'm sure there's lots of em out there and they call this a light had these are great for hiding and you know
309.09,328.62, under a bar if you wanted just high light something like this table of what he has obviously do in the proper way where it looked natural but these are great for that let talk about columned upper okay so there's presentability and
329.19,348.03, and a presentative can present a force i tungsten thirty two hundred and down the twenty seven hundred i can just stroll on a knob and distant dolente literal in jumping like twenty five lilith twenty five
348.18,362.19, you can do intolerant actually put us one but bearing an jumpin or were dolignan also to the dimming so and now he just dumped it up
362.31,407.82, here is your tremendous amount of difference i had a waiter down that's equal to it seems to be about seven fifty the funny thing is as a right now not many people would have rent in this out the honest with you we just got it and not long ago i don't think anybody even realizes that it exists in this point so i really wanted to kind of point that without because i loved that light at the top of williston's upon a really important thing with the making and with all of this fear that we carry and that is to me he preceded had a direct purpose and you know certainly for me stand out because
408.18,427.92, you start saying well i'm using this all the time and why because he works in does the job and it works we are going to be making a lot of these films so pilferer ridendus you can reach us at inpatient
