0.12,30.09, you much for radiation
30.21,32.94, gentlemen giorni
33.33,38.46, this is a fish with all started for me about nine years ago
38.82,59.7, it is and with this has to do with food disinter action will be complete during the first part of my presentation in the following parts reveller explore the senses the interaction between a sense of yermak also as attractive as possible you have the box
60.78,76.8, i don't eat as a remind you because ye will or integrates what is in the box with the presentation and use how descensus react on that maybe now you're convinced that food is just food
77.04,84.15, in the presentation it will become clear that food is not just food food is what you make of it
84.27,96.09, percent of how experience food is not in the food but round the fatal show this clearly during the presentation and we was start directly with a first
96.24,98.94, experiments and your box
99.42,101.58, have you
102.63,113.64, open the box or david took out of the box and you open the top but you don't smell and you don't pay so you do like this
113.79,127.44, don't you don't smell any don't they so this everybody is sure insight if you cannot eat you good don't eat it with if you can please so everybody has over the to her
127.44,132.42, so now you ingeniose her earthly this
132.63,153.15, okay ever you notice you bore in the shower it about a body yet for the sugar so it's so that you will have substance it superseded texture because of the caesar a hoopoe
153.21,154.47, you have
154.53,161.25, cinnamon so it's a very easy sick but it shows something fortement
165.33,189.45, so and the heron to one so so shows something from mental debts if you look to the century made fitted that nose and the tongue that excitement of the experience is determined by your nose you know is really a crucial element in the eating experience and
190.2,194.73, we made on this mask this york
194.91,209.13, gentlepeople remember how important the noise made the extra big long nose and even flavour is that important that favour that your own will also determine
209.13,211.35, nations we can make
211.53,213.39, then we go into
213.39,215.22, food bedding
215.37,222.33, so a small crucial bards and going to footman because a roman also the germans
222.45,234.57, can you combine into your plate now how did he set with his whole food bearing an idea about the ten years ago assertor with chefs
234.57,241.59, that time you had for other from a boy and he had time to close his restaurant for a half year
241.77,245.85, experiments and ninety nine per cent of the chefs
246.12,255.24, able to do that so i sort of a creature of finding new methods to develop more efficient newcoming
255.36,271.77, and so while doing this we looking of course you saw with something you look as a something mennonite past and there two people one was a flavor from human and he had made a combination with jasmine
272.13,281.4, based on the fact that for a favourest when when he smiles jasmine he knows kagami has some forenote
281.7,290.4, so alice typical for jasmine that depending on the concentration goes from fort meet
290.85,293.31, it's quite
293.91,324.12, to have a mediator into judgment what would happen if he would combine the jasmine and liver so he has done that at a seminar which as the mere combination of the jasmine and the lever and we the great combination now one of the chiefs also present at that event was his woman i assume most of affiliates women in search of perfection fairfortune resound there are the nerestan in them
324.27,331.62, a long and so has morals present at that event and when isolate he was working with chocolate
332.4,336.66, it is something remarkable well
337.32,342.99, who likes to make chocolate somebody would like to make a
343.44,348.78, sometimes you find in the recipe of a chocolate cake pinch of salt
349.32,355.56, the first example of interaction we have five basic facts so sweet
355.92,366.93, so bitter mammy and salt maryfort ones who are not familiar with mammy that the parishioner
367.41,372.42, five basic tastes but the interaction because
372.48,374.88, imagine a man to have this
375.12,393.12, sling but i wont to use as much salt just by adding many increasingly alarmed i can have a dish which is assulting but with less old everhards which is to set all add acidity when the half dish which is to better i will add
396.72,415.38, salt the great answer you may we think that she gerold be right answer but sat his more efficient if you if you don't like donabue it marette try to add some salt and if you talk to baratarians they they have sold
415.77,419.58, because they know that the initiate balance bands the flavor
419.85,435.87, so you have sold in the top of it because we want to reduce the bitterness why do we not want to reduce a bitterness because by genetic we don't like it like sweet like salt lick mine but not bitterness but as that of adding salt
436.05,442.65, he was adding medications within chocolate and salt ingredients like an
442.8,445.8, and chocolate while
445.98,457.44, nation so eaten why the chocolate and the caviar matches he contacted the guy from the flavor house they looked at the face of profile and they saw overlap
457.53,467.13, actually quite accidentally because the overlap they saw was not the correct one as we have shown later but they found erling so
467.19,488.04, and in nineteen o the ninety and two thousand there were rocking on ascension of an hypothesis that you can combine ingredients when they have flavor romanones in common to two out of the nine years of research we have done we have found that not
488.25,502.71, correct really have to look and which are important molecules and how are the interaction between all molecules again interaction is a crucial part to determine what can be combined
505.95,513.93, we will have out some some steps because i have here a molecule which is cold bengali
515.61,519.12, and my question to you please have a smell
520.86,525.87, yeah okay he had a smell like a perfume so not not to close
526.65,527.73, this
527.85,530.58, i tried to guess what your smiling
532.5,536.7, she not that difficult to guess guess what the what you may
539.97,543.42, maybe somebody over the mind of tooele out
543.63,544.98, this man
554.01,583.71, but these have a smell and actually the bensersiel for almonds but also for junior apples for pies because all those plants are part of a family and they all make tentative if you having a barbecue and use applerod or cherrywood it also contains the bengali is your inurbane and you're eating cherry blossom peterboro at will also contain depends on it all these ingredients at the combined benoliel the chocolate
583.86,591.66, because by roasting grate that molecule sebak stake or rose chocolate
591.69,599.73, making that monica base on a breakdown product of monastic you know all this ingredients
600.18,603.99, beats important so that means that you can start to combine
604.38,631.8, one is a disadvantage height at the fender so it is roasted for great mentality roasting of almonds and carries to you can combine based on that moleswich is in common one is for example that an element in an amanoolla to face contains mendelian dried ham also
631.89,639.78, the mutoscope those based on that policy have in your box also
641.25,643.8, not apple but the other chocolate
644.16,645.12, one
648.0,651.21, this coat also contains
651.3,658.68, from nature the monica adjust mouth it ejaculate contains mentality with beating
658.74,687.51, joy contains at a tea of recruits and desolated at the best restaurant in belgium which is a fantasyland store restaurant and is made by socrates in a moment housing food being all the time to create his new type of choice have have a bite and imagine your attestors round in a crest in the belgium
695.31,700.35, a great
700.71,703.68, so what you do 
704.73,717.03, scientists the majority of of the company are barges or physicist and not we do as we analyze with particles it the flames from product so affordable the fish
717.18,753.54, with other lives the roast to a different types of equipment that is put into a database and took on the four data base we have algorithms and they visualize information and what we call footprints and these are used by chiefs bartenders and food industry wrote right we have about one million ussolie the majority is one of the half twenty percent is bartenstein in the oftenest on our our algerian
755.73,765.3, it took like this for a moment the change very soon and of this month we have a part for free
765.51,791.97, with ingredients and with recipes and there's also a scription part for food professionals for as i want you can find on the website or the footprint trees so that the visualization used to explain to her to fwhat combinations are you can make so when he for the first time and is the oyster
793.02,798.39, to compare with other ingredients we found much
798.42,800.07, what we
800.16,809.94, right the black agate lasso i find a connection between easter and the kelso
810.03,813.51, back to this from the beginning
813.57,818.91, this is actually a combination of oyster and gericault
818.94,834.42, it's a dish from a famous chef in belgium to milan starch and become centres it was based on in another as we have done on the oyster and found connection to 
834.42,844.11, to the s actually how do you reach a footprint like this so we have the product you want to combine it in the middle
844.47,894.21, there and all around in the besancon combine with oysters and the repressed into getreide on the top we have very products than you go to meet her and spices condiments vegetables and so on so imagine aunt to make a combination between oyster and fruits i go to the fruit category and i see kinemon bergamot or possible combinations to do or shall amon is a classic on but for example bergamottes also sittest actually worked better than than lemon because the distance the shorter the product is to the middle the better temascal that secular type of oliver from spain much is very well to oyster you have the cap the burgomaster to the centre the better to match with all the ingredients that you see around the foot print
894.57,896.4, do much with her
896.88,912.45, with the ways and as a aside as a footprint of comes it really and aspirational too for ships to create new new combinations or for a high incest find confirmation of fortified by the by intuition
913.89,958.29, then you had to coming out of the first food pantry so you were with a lot of brands very strong and everything that cocktails with headings was also in great intertainment like provolone have analyzed all the coffee from from colombia assegnato work and bear and chocolates and december was intonation in the past but now he dealt
958.59,964.02, we do a lot of research on quite a lot of products
964.14,978.12, at otto protocole interesting for you because one we have the foot brantome platform merican see the combinations that how the new outside will alike with one or hand we have a private p
978.21,1024.59, or which is used by companies for example in the middle and we have to ripen the apis much more vanamee find honor on the foot being upside because we're not only able to say what combinations work but we can also say in what quantity it works and were not into big data so we don't paterson what is there on existing recipes or to relate in the company is really analyzed and try to understand why certain combinations work and because we understand for any able to generate from scratch recipes so for example with a coal grate i can select whatever drink you want and the computer yerville what is the ideal
1024.65,1027.68, drink in that case
1028.37,1053.48, there some people revered are all over the world for example in the left corner that belgian chemist become the best european chief of the year we have hasten from earnest of conary adoniram langannerie bartendin the world the guiraudon is a garret
1054.14,1069.89, and he took a ten on his face so which is alligator otterscope because one may we have the creativity you will get all the chefs williston all with a lot of seville and also working with which foot with foot companies
1072.11,1092.78, can also use in another one of the ships also using food bring his grand acts from one in chicago is using footballing inishmaan also use it outside and were he to he does it but are another one but is sitting at the table and before you dauville
1092.81,1101.09, and in the billow the rest and the roar of notice and then they come with the plate and they put the plate on top of the pillow
1101.09,1114.53, the place is some wide being with some tomato mango to rise and form of a bear but the plate is pushing on the pillow and the royal bed by retaliating
1115.16,1118.04, mixing the not make room with
1118.43,1120.05, though i be
1120.74,1173.0, so this in combination with this much sorting with pine brings me to the following persons which is sleepiness fitters and he has published like chichinette in the nineteen thirties or the spithead of his time at least for the the footpaths on portstewart he was ready mentioning that people shoot at flavors perfumes during lunch and i will show you an example from rock aich is a number one in the world a serious use the room it was also working on unusual combination so the sardina the finale although for me it's not anatomisation i think you can imagine that a gilt sardinians
1173.42,1174.47, no
1174.5,1179.12, okay but the native was quite unusual
1179.48,1186.92, but he also was thinking about something else and for that i need a ranter steve
1187.97,1197.12, he doesn't know what he's going to do so or if alethea
1197.18,1203.87, drink alcohol liquor so first of all i will bind you by false
1206.87,1208.7, the two different things
1212.48,1218.27, arkas first of all ages this
1218.3,1221.51, now and and then you have to start roaming
1225.44,1228.62, okay or give you the first drink
1232.22,1235.16, the most
1237.59,1238.7, and
1239.48,1242.54, the amount and ruin on the
1242.54,1244.25, at
1245.78,1248.51, thank you so
1250.1,1253.43, in mind but you have tasted now i guess you miss relate
1264.92,1267.05, i like to see the second drink
1269.12,1270.35, i have 
1272.09,1277.34, no and i return mister rabbit you and
1283.13,1288.56, okay you can the least blank full form no
1289.46,1295.28, so can you describe but you what how is the first thing different than he in the second drink
1302.96,1307.73, i think the second one was a little
1309.02,1323.81, like sweet lady here and the first one had a more and a woody taste to it okay and i feeling that you were about to tell me that i was drinking the same thing they hear
1323.96,1340.58, but to give the right answer because what you touch is also influencing the texture full into your mouth like the more of the biltmore like a stranger so you have the wood well something soft but belike sweeter softer greener
1340.64,1350.63, great thank you very much you want the rapid backstays i have given notice thank you so
1350.93,1380.57, that guy the earthly penal marinate had had the idea that when people are are going to find dining the shot were a game and the game you have sand paper or felt because by teaching that you will have its time different experience although it's the same food and yet set in belgium from salt's off that gave an icecream to people in the after the decent paper and something soft
1380.63,1385.79, while being the sun paper the the eyes became more grainy
1385.94,1398.63, something soft more dreamy and all texture on table being the chair the table cowall influence how will experience the food so texture
1400.28,1407.48, the table got enamel it or quite important to determine who actually well perceive
1407.75,1421.46, this so do what you touch but also influence how you taste or the texture is an oval of touch is stamped and it is a famous example from the faucet
1421.7,1431.63, it's like it but what is fascinating a bit it's only i think but left it is i cold and the right side is very hot
1431.66,1433.22, you're drinking it
1433.4,1444.95, make it to get gold and a hot it's only icecream with really fantastic experience because you playing water with with the temperature and you don't expect it
1445.01,1453.89, so notation the interaction between the side and taste and we've done research for a pain company they wanted to make
1454.64,1463.76, a new range of course but the word had something new to it the wont to us to research what is relation between
1464.12,1465.26, the
1465.29,1469.79, and the caller so i would like to have five
1469.82,1472.64, sontag came
1474.53,1477.23, gone
1478.37,1487.43, you you should be from europe or us not from australia or asia or explain afterwards whites
1493.31,1495.65, we made coats
1498.89,1502.22, how much alive so he can stay
1505.28,1508.1, the
1509.63,1512.75, she's all her five guards to
1513.56,1524.57, you can also play with us so we have to fight cards so as explained before we have five basic taste sour bitter mammy and salty
1525.17,1535.22, no i go in to ask you which guards reflects which these so have a look at your five guards and show me which gardiston
1539.12,1541.88, something too much go for it
1542.51,1548.78, you're all right so this is a sweet cart now which god is the soul
1550.91,1552.5, there
1555.44,1563.81, okay all five grettir is a select so the goldicutt which one is salty
1563.84,1565.67, god has a soul
1566.87,1583.16, keats also to this are otasite familiar with no raging to inverness and and mary which is not that acquainted for us to veritatis cortelyou think is better
1589.16,1593.42, this one so the majority had a flight this is better
1593.42,1596.27, the last card is a more
1597.8,1605.51, thank you very much i will explain why you can make the and from your from europe 
1605.84,1608.3, a great
1608.48,1628.34, her age so steamer calkilatin you very much so why is it that we can make association between taste and colour because we build that during our lifetime the first time you you tell
1629.39,1635.33, or a line or a nitrite remember that it is
1635.42,1642.38, so so you will associate the color of the fruit or the products with the tastes
1642.56,1647.75, the same form for example for sweets of fury avogadro
1651.65,1679.43, this is a street car in the talk you have sweet desert so why do you associate this with sweet because of sweets of orange of strawberry of bananas so we have even this remade association the reason i i said not people from a trio as because they have different reference in the different fruits and the manifest association between the colour and the taste
1679.64,1702.38, you know on this experiment a lot of time and in europe and thus it also so why is the salt because salt is white but only it is not so it is a combination with blue colour of the sea yellow the color of the sand green of allegation of that color gave us salty in impression
1702.92,1710.09, mammy that the tatars that matthat the beef
1710.12,1720.11, so also associate those color that's great various well with more dark you associate those cool
1720.29,1729.2, the yellow and the green and the nose also a dish which is so and look so
1729.92,1746.0, or better and better every don't like so by genetic we don't like acidity and bitterness because a critical fomentation of sable toxic better than be like voices like like those berries were never eats very
1746.12,1753.02, by genetic is not by learning its ly by genetics if you detest with
1753.17,1759.44, children just born new born there they will hate better
1760.28,1777.74, so then you can be like a combination so you have streets of disarray and then the callers associated to it so for example you see red can be sweet or mammy but when ratiocination it for example yellow and pink then it will be sweet
1778.01,1800.48, will be mainly be salty and when you have a green and yellow it operates so i can put products on too and see the relation between the proceeds and association we make the food taste like over so you will associate those colors with it over
1800.57,1802.16, and if it were drawn
1802.28,1813.2, at this i don't elmore extreme but will be for example tell to barton this if if you recoil is sweet don't you see
1813.23,1838.19, colors because before even that the cocktail renverse made a judgment that the cocktail will be sour amenities and sweet it will not fit may be out now what is wrong with it it will not fit is only high and chest who can permit themselves to play with us like heston has some dishes when he changing with colors and taste
1838.19,1848.69, more like a play in the in the normal world in restaurants and distressing cockleburs you shoot half to fit the in the color and the test
1849.11,1855.05, so let's see if you've got it so the wit is one
1855.08,1859.13, the green is to direct tree and the blues for
1859.4,1863.33, this are four times the same popcorn
1863.87,1868.55, which of cornwallis the most salty
1868.64,1870.74, one white
1872.39,1875.6, two green
1876.95,1878.75, the red
1879.71,1881.09, for me
1882.83,1884.96, at the four
1885.02,1887.72, because if he escape
1888.59,1892.4, the blue is most associated with
1893.87,1895.73, so in the blue
1897.5,1917.48, cornelis most assaulting besant experiment imagine your inner bar and we can play with the colors we have like a white rat a blue and the green color and you have wine in the glass and the glass is not unspannable so you can't see the color of the wine
1918.14,1922.31, so you get the same line in the same glass of four times
1922.76,1924.71, with a wide collar
1926.57,1931.01, and a green color so
1931.28,1937.22, how will this wine change from the other one this one not be the most
1939.83,1963.71, it so and if you do the best you actually see that just by changing the color of environment the same wine just as wine well satanically be more sweeter perceived than when you have different calls so actually when you play with the colors in your bar or in the oresteian le influence how people deceive
1963.71,1965.57, the food
1966.62,1974.06, so that the more fruit in that but that's lying to the sweetness and as he likes treatise most that will also be like
1974.36,1975.32, most
1976.43,1981.98, so coarsely big influence on harry perceive food product
1982.67,1993.95, is it only the color is also for example the wet so issue with each a yogurt with these points so some plastic spoons and the stiletto
1994.4,1997.04, the state punishable
1997.49,1999.17, i have
1999.2,2003.82, associate that yogurt being better
2003.82,2009.22, though is the same youth there is my when you drink
2009.46,2012.01, and it's a heavy glass is
2012.52,2038.56, a more premium and the whole met about the shape of the glasses and influencing the drome his only true for really experts is not ruefully average consumer if i give you the same wine and if definite classes but i briefly you will say it's a same wine when i give you the same glassenclosed difference flavor is just in the perception
2038.68,2047.44, this is also with a manual of many cart is light or heavy heavy mingoville more expensive better
2047.47,2060.43, that has an influence on high perceived the foot also there the past so in the second one the sea this point same cesares
2060.43,2066.01, rich jewel based the most saltiest short
2072.88,2075.82, for anybody else
2076.54,2101.5, the the second one will taste the most sharp and soldier is more like a normal way of eating cheese so you not assisting different with it but eating a cheese from a knife like this will make the cheese more shalt and more sharp so again the discontinuance
2101.74,2118.51, you perceive it also interaction between the material of the spoon for example and the taste like if you have a spoon which is served bronze of it sink it will taste more bitter than than like a goal in oranside spoon so your saadat interference
2120.28,2126.25, let's go to a following interaction between hearing
2127.42,2128.89, seeing
2130.99,2138.88, me to one story one professor very active on this motion
2140.56,2151.63, experiment and research is a caress from oxford university and he is working with some mental and as some had one
2152.14,2162.91, as an oyster at the casa have it when you drink a glass wine when you decision and you take the same wine at home and you take the same line is not the same any more
