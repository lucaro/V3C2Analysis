54.42,144.15, there's been quite a bit of talk lately about alternatives to nursing homes retirement communities and assisted living facilities do we age better together and is their power in community another mystery for me was why i moved blindly into the silver sage village chousing community in north bolderwood i had no idea of five years ago that living in an intentional neighbourhood we place such a huge roll in saving my life chousing is a neighborhood of people with private lives private homes but cheesto live together as a community neighbors also share in the ownership and upkeep of spaces such as the garden in common house i wondered what some of my neighbors thought about growing old among their peers all of us are over fifty years of age what are their perspectives about aging and community margaret porter retired from the federal government and moved along with her husband and to boulder from maryland i was pushing to live in it nicer apartment complex simply south then he said no i want to be one inside reaching out and not on the outside licenses to contract an movin that's how we got him

151.14,154.92, he had margaret or among the original silver sage members
155.01,162.87, the poor me he has a are
163.14,180.27, and recalls a retired public television staff member he and his wife jean moved to boulder from san francisco but in two thousand and eight june was diagnosed with the mania which we doubt confirmed as all times
180.48,184.86, he is a mostly retired facilitators and mediator
185.22,189.0, he and his wife and a long time bolder residence
189.3,200.4, first of all after our daughter left for college he motivation was down sizing but we were knowledgeable about causing this unit happened to be on the market
200.49,215.19, when the cook is a retired nurse who recently moved to boulder from kentucky she is among the newcomers to silver sage village had never heard of chasing the former so and in lower we take back and
215.61,228.66, an opportunity came up where there was a hinted available at soerensen of wonderland hills development which developed silver stage village he and his wife brownie also live in silver sage
228.84,252.84, so really came out of the work that checkered did when he went to denmark and studied what the danes were doing with the cosmoline and tether was one chasing community senior chasing community and denmark that really impressed me started by five couples in the early fifties and
252.84,258.87, so very much out of denial that it was easy for them to imagine a happy and successful
258.96,260.16, hood
260.67,267.36, i also wanted to find out if there is any research happening about to housing
267.51,280.47, the work that i have done with cousin has led me to believe that there's something very positive happening there it's not an easy way to live because you are living close to other people in community and people kind of know your business
282.57,288.18, what advice do we have for any one interested in joining or developing a co housing community
289.02,293.64, number one is you've got to be real about the housing you're doing
293.64,302.52, i have merely thoughtful conversation about how you're going to
302.85,306.75, be compassionate with and care for one another
306.84,317.7, one of the things i'm also very interested in is this idea of mutual support and how can older people help each other cause in our society we often think of older people is dependent
317.7,320.1, and we need to take care of them but really
320.1,331.26, many older people are quite independent are quite able to help each other the nave been in the college dormitory or demand binary but would a people live together
331.32,332.49, any way
332.7,336.48, in america had any place
336.66,347.34, we have a peroration

361.47,369.06, much more of an opportunity for growth for everyone involved then you might possibly imagine
370.23,379.47, i am first and foremost what's the most critical and the mountain or office is if it doesn't work socially why bother
379.59,408.42, always assumed that everybody is going to have family who will take care of them when they get older and that really is not the case for everybody for one reason or another they don't have family or their fire away or whatever living in cooling isn't easy facing up to personal changes and meeting those challenges continued to be important as we age regardless i'm confident there will always be carrying people around to provide neighborly support for others
409.05,436.71, i hope you've gained some insight and some tips about aging and community a juice whether living in chousing is the life style for you
