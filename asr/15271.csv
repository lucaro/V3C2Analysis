0.03,23.34, hello hello everybody this is nice for you to carry we are in chicago at the people summit this is the third and final day and today we are joined by adiabeni hoare you today and great coterie haven't dealer and ideas going to talk about cointet about some other things we're going to start with 
23.4,29.34, the third day how have you enjoyed it or how what is your perception of this time so far the people some 
30.42,43.59, my group could think in focus a lot on firmly issues and so i've loved the sun smit in terms of the energy and bregava great talk and there have been exciting workshops
43.71,48.51, from the point of view of somebody who really focuses on foreign policy issues in like
48.57,52.74, are they and that so strange to me because it seems
52.98,55.71, a criticism that we have throughout
55.71,61.05, sanders campaign is why is it addressing the issue of
61.23,68.76, the empire the huge pentagon budget if we want to find health care and three public education
68.79,74.07, and the needs of this community and infrastructure where's that money going to come from
74.19,75.96, bloated pentagon budget
76.02,78.45, now donald trump has handed us
78.66,83.91, vehicle to talk about it because in addition to the big pentagon budget that already existed
84.0,92.61, and another billion and this time he sang we're going to take it from the aw're going to take it from nelson wheels we're going to take it from
92.61,94.44, school programs
94.95,98.7, we would all be able to come together and say at least
98.79,102.0, no to that extra billion for war
102.15,107.22, and yet i haven't heard that mentioned at all in the entire great
108.39,119.4, no really good points also bring up you know some maybe oversight in the people summit bringing this up but let's talk about this more literature so we have this pentagon budget is massive
119.4,130.74, you may talk about like some statue percentages of military spendius maybe even comparing and you bring up the good point those resources could be used for other means
130.74,135.6, when it comes to the pentagon budget on what is the deal with the how is it so expensive
136.14,141.42, thus has always had a budget that is
141.72,142.83, nor this
142.83,147.66, in recent decades we never got the peace divide that we were supposed to get
147.78,150.81, after the vietnam war and
150.87,159.0, the pentagon budget is without the extra billion already bigger than the rest of the bennet countries combined
159.18,160.68, massive
160.95,169.53, and then along comes donald trump he says a military is decimated we need more tanks we need more planes we need more troops we need more marines we need were this we need with that
169.8,177.18, and you would think that the most progressive voices in this country would be the loudest ones out there saying
177.24,193.59, ah that's not why we're not winning more raining words because we're in worse shouldn't be in and we should be getting out of those words instead of throwing more resources and more of our soldiers into them while we were here at the summit to soldiers got killed in afghanistan
194.79,207.15, years were in afghanistan the longest word the us has ever fought in our entire history i have not heard the word afghanistan mentioned at all in the summit at a time when
207.42,210.06, wants to send more troops
210.18,216.21, afghanistan to guarantee that we will continue to be in this untenable war
216.33,220.35, where now with thanks to donald trump going to spend
220.47,224.4, then percent of our discretionary funds
224.52,232.56, the pentagon and yet were arguing to see where we should be taking the money to provide things like free college education
233.46,241.02, point really good point so when it comes to coincon you talk about a little bit pink and the mission of kolbenhayer do
241.5,252.99, i started when george which was threatening to take us into iraq after the attacks and we like so many people around the world said no no no no this makes no sense
253.35,258.18, little did we know how absolutely catastrophic it would be
258.27,260.13, i was the wrong thing to do
260.16,266.43, we formed around that it's called code pink because george bush for your younger listeners who might not know where your viewers
266.49,278.4, he had at that time a color coded let system you remember that were the terror alert there was the yellow of the range the red make you feel scared justify things like military invasions and we said colin
278.46,284.55, a different way of dealing with dunwich as deal with the individuals who attacked us
284.97,311.46, and maybe even the country behind it saudi arabia because we should talk a lot more about that but not use it to attack other countries like iraq that had nothing to do with so we have been working ever since then against the perpetual state of war that our country is in and calling for a reduction in the mills
311.58,330.12, and instead use our military to defend us at home and take these hundreds of millions of dollars we would save and invested in things that we need at home as well as things would do good for people around the world like the millions of refugees that have created in large part because of our policies
330.15,347.67, i mentioned the catastrophic results of the invasion of iraq will look at the millions of refugees created and the us doesn't want to take in those refugees and we don't want to give the massive amounts of money later needed for the refugees from syria from a rack from libya from places that
347.73,349.59, are militarily involved
349.86,352.2, that's been the mission of coping
352.26,371.94, ay and so you bring up a very very very good point about the refugees there is probably the biggest refugee crisis in the history and right now it's caused by the western imperial forces military forces that are like as you said responding to this war anterson it comes to these refugees when it comes afghanistan a
371.94,373.32, in
373.35,386.67, sort of gaynor opposition to that at the capital and can you talk a little bit about that like how are you going about maybe picking your people that you are going to restore it
386.73,390.69, first we say about the refugees we also send people to
390.69,397.71, places like greece to the border in syria i myself was the border of a turkey and the refugee camps
397.74,406.5, we go to jordan we tried to get people to care about the refugees raised money for refugee projects
406.62,417.81, and then we also want to get at the root of the problem which is the militarism and so we go to live now in washington d c we go to the hearing
417.9,422.25, we go through the halls of power we
422.37,424.02, try to
424.98,435.27, port bills that are being introduced in congress but we're really trying to hard to rebuild an anti war movement that was so strong under the bushes but fell apart under but a boma
435.45,440.46, still not building itself up under them which is hard to understand because
440.61,442.02, now
442.08,445.95, not only increasing the military budget that we talked about
445.98,450.78, taking some of the worst of what obaa did and increasing it for example
450.9,452.25, old
452.25,459.06, massive mounts of weapons to saudi arabia saudi arabia is the one country most responsible for the spread of terrorism
459.36,465.9, here comes down mate's going to one up a boma and felt even more weapons to saudi arabia
465.93,470.49, in the meantime saudi arabia is destroying the neighboring country of yemen
470.49,474.72, a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions
474.87,478.5, a million people facing famine right now
478.74,484.5, and we're having a hard time injecting it even into a place as progressive as the people summit
484.53,489.87, so if you detect my frustration it's because i'm trying hard to find ways
489.93,520.98, get people to understand the connection between all the issues that we care about and the perpetual wars that we have been involved in and the fact that we are still an empire squandering so much of our resources on trying to invade and occupy other countries as well as supporting repressive regimes like the government of israel they repress a courage in egypt and i think that if we manage to get people to connect these is better
521.1,538.23, be better able to confront the policies that both the democrats and the republicans have alluded on to continue to spend so many billions of dollars of our money on wars that are creating death agony and millions of refugees
538.29,551.37, when it comes to these wars do you think it's a mechanism of them perpetuating their monetary gain and the continual you know expansion or do you what do you think is driving these wars
551.79,568.98, first of all we should recognize what general eisenhower told us in the early beware of the military industrial complex it is so strong the power of these weapons industries is amazing it can even take the most progressive
569.07,577.77, elected officials and have them voting for things like money to saudi arabia because they have repenties
577.77,579.12, in their districts
579.21,590.1, i would say it's money money money if you look at the saudi policy its oil the oil and it's the weapons industry and unfortunately
590.13,614.07, the weapons manufacturers and so smart that they produce a piece of their weapons in every single congressional district and then come election time they give money to the congress people this is a corrupt system that is made up of a revolving door the people go in and out of these companies into congress
614.1,670.62, and it's part of the system that's become so corrupt that war is extremely profitable and the voices of the war makers are unfortunately right now a lot stronger than the voice of the peacemakers even when the peacemakers were in the street stallion peep into that thanatomania couldn't stop this impenetrable war machine what is that that attack to the institutions that invest in the war machine and a divestment campaign like the fossil fuel industry is done that goes to universities pension funds to all of the institutional investors cities are on cities and say we have to pull our money out of the military complex
670.68,674.67, the thing we've been doing is going city by city and passing resolutions
674.79,681.87, we want money pulls from the pentagon and put into our cities were taking that nationally to the mayor's conference
682.05,689.43, that meets at the end of june and trying to pass it nationwide so these are some of the ways to come from the bottom up
689.52,693.54, unfortunately from the top down it's too corrupt
693.72,712.02, maybe a couple of ask questions when it comes to talkin already you have a refugees welcome sure on it there was a refugee welcome banner that got dropped from the statue of liberty in talk about just like the movement even around in the united states of america around welcoming refugees
712.08,724.23, i think we should give to the movement of welcoming immigrants because this is a nation that's built by refugees immigrants slaves native americans but this is a nation that has become so cruel
724.23,757.53, at the people who are in desperate situations whether or not it's caused by our policies we should be carrying about people in desperate situations around the world it's a basic moral issue i know i'm the mother i've taught my children and my grandchildren to care about people who are lacking in food and lacking in clean water and lacking in medicines do what we can for them and as a nation unfortunately have gunpowder now who is to do the dance
757.53,763.89, wants to take families have been here immigrant families for decades and throw the man of this country
763.89,773.76, very opposite of what we need to be as the nation a kind compassionate nation that welcomes people into our country when they're seeking refuge
774.06,790.56, so maybe the last question here people summit hearing that they'll probably be planning this next year there's going to be other such types of conventions what do you hope in the future to tackle not only just a foreign policy needs that you're talking about the people need to be recognizing but also just other things in general
790.83,800.19, the elephant in the room is that their party issues and people are more and more critical of the democratic party and it's great to hear the fiery speeches saying we don't have to stick with the democrats
800.28,814.98, then what do we do i like the green party i think it's great but there's a lot of people feel we need a new party that's going to come out of perhaps the bernie sanders movement that's why there's this campaign draft sanders for people's party i think it's a great idea
815.01,826.35, to be clear that whether or not bernie sanders decides to join that we're going to build up this party in this party can incorporate the greens and the socialist parties and all the smaller groups
826.47,831.48, have a significant alternative to the two party system so i hope that
831.66,835.83, we have a much more open for the conversation about that
836.43,842.58, thank you so much is there anything else you'd like to add people saw many refugees foreign carfon policy anything
844.44,853.89, obviously at the time when people are desperate for alternatives a lot of people have voted for trump we're doing that out of disgust for politics as usual
854.01,880.02, i think we have to do a better job at reaching those people we have to do a better job of having a big that people feel is a tent where there's a lot of good parting going on inside they want to be part of that we have to show the alternative lethargic good for our spirits shoemaker
881.28,898.47, for joining us adiabeni from colin and i thank you all for joining us this is no you care are here at the people submit you like our word go to uncorrupted give it you can if you can montmichel us a lot again thank you so much and we'll see you again
