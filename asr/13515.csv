5.7,32.16, reasoning is called the incredulity of saint thomas paine cavasa
32.22,36.21, an italian baroque artist in the early 
36.45,43.74, captures the moment of thomas's doubt about the resurrection of jesus dissipating in the light of the evidence
43.86,47.13, he puts his finger into the side of jesus
48.84,58.62, is the paintings notoriety due to carve use skill as a painter or is it due to the fact that so many of us can identify
58.62,60.51, the contents of the painting
61.05,73.32, all of us go through doubts about our faith at different times and ask the question is there enough evidence to support my beliefs with christianity it all comes down to this
73.74,90.63, there enough evidence to support jesus resurrection from the debt we all have a belief a belief some people believe in evolution and some people believe intelligent design
91.02,95.85, some people believe in capitalism and still others believe in socialism
96.09,100.11, those that say they don't believe in anything and yet
100.53,102.78, believe in that belief
103.41,105.63, what do you believe
105.69,116.73, and what is the evidence of your belief three weeks from now you will present her belief and more importantly to present the evidence of that belief
118.32,138.6, question caroline caroline had weak polani's fine just thinking about this time we got it was a great minesweeper us and even christians all her lives
138.75,140.16, just the thing
140.85,149.76, now the evidence for what i believe what i do you go to church your whole life but it's like as moses and take on everyone else's face
150.0,212.01, you know why well i mean i believe because i adopt you see my predicament minor predicament i think that will be good for us to explore the foundation of our faith i don't even know where to start how but with a resurrection as that is coralie eleven do that you domingos come onto
213.18,235.53, oh i'm getting nowhere with this you know rome wasn't built in a day rome also fell all what's your presentation about evidence for the resurrection of jesus
237.27,265.35, i believe in that oh ah and you don't get a personal investigation into the claims of jesus lessons what what did you find out susanna good man a teacher devote spiritual person but as far as empirical evidence of the other action there is none is based on claims of others that invested three years of their lives falling him it's understandable made one think their lives had been wasted when he died
265.71,279.75, i think his body was stolen it hindered tradition that jesus traveled out south east asia learning many of his teaching from the spiritual ears of india so you aren't denying jesus was real notion
280.02,282.51, i think everyone was believed jesus was real
282.51,286.05, but he did not rise from the bed well what you believed them
286.08,293.61, a muslim i believe his body was taken into heaven so he would not experience a crucifixion that is why his body was never found
293.85,301.47, rely on evidence that is the source of our life we have an even discuss what buddhist mormons and others say
301.8,306.21, no one has any idea what a cur with his body but it didn't rise from the dead
308.28,317.61, every one has an explanation porticus body not being in the time i was that
317.67,335.94, the resurrection occurred if his claims were true and it only be held a capable to him as being god just like claims on that of explaining away that's conducive to one believe
336.0,355.35, you're bearing beliefs on the resurrection don't prove anything but you all agreed on one thing with me and that is she says body was not in the tomb something did happen 
355.41,393.72, all testament prophecies about jesus or manuscripts like the dead sea crows which predator proven true according to that bruce if the new testament were collection of secular writings their authenticity which generally be regarded as beyond all doubt some spicy that chess didn't die but fainted he been beaten crucified and starved for three days how can he move a hundred pounds of burials and move a fifteen hundred pound rock
393.72,409.59, hundreds of people saw him over the course of nine appearances some were strangers and sceptics there is no historical account of groups nation when paul wrote first corinthians he told people to ask the witnesses since they were still alive
411.84,494.07, solomon is okay the empty till the entrances baby a boulder that neither lovers to put it into place the boulder itself water fifteen hundred pounds and the two had a roman sea on it he put a death sentence had been crucified upside down on any one who provided besides that there was a contingent of at least four roman soldiers guarding and transparent any one for stealing a body so the defences were put in place he the boy from being stolen exactly and by this time masticators had a man in him to the rosebody anyway he how much do you think that french way i don't know for five hundred pounds timmediate trying to move a boulder that was fifteen hundred a babylike chided hippo has just read never mind and that does even factor in that the roman soldiers or the fair being prostitution
494.1,504.0, pinafore no one
506.37,526.71, in my study of the lives of the apostles i found that they were men who ran scared from the local authorities when jesus was arrested and crucified they lost all hope and some went back to the old professions they gave no inclination whatsoever that they were about to change the course of human history
526.74,547.89, what brought about the abrupt and extreme change within them the apostle thomas doubted the claims of the resurrection by saying he wouldn't believe until he could see the marks of the nails and she says hands what motivated thomas the man who anonymous would doubt to travel to india and china to proclaim the truth about jesus and face martyrdom
548.07,550.41, the resurrection of jesus
550.71,562.32, five hundred witnesses saw him alive and flesh and blood when the apostle saw jesus resurrected it became a catalyst that emphatically changed the course of their lives
562.32,565.05, if jesus overcame death
565.83,580.95, they have to doubt or fear nothing for the rest of their lives they were persecuted they were imprisoned and many died for their faith why would they all embrace the life if it were alive
582.06,588.6, everything hinges on the resurrection if it's true that every one should believe in god
588.75,593.7, it is false and christianity should be dismissed as a force
594.54,605.85, some people have a hard time believing the evidence for the resurrection it happened two thousand years ago there is no witness that still alive to speak authoritatively on the matter there is no smoking gun
606.0,612.15, and if you only focus on a single piece of evidence i'm not sure you can make a compelling case
612.9,623.28, if you step back and look at the big picture a mosaic of truth emerges jesus was who he said he was
623.67,624.75, let
624.99,626.22, he died
626.46,627.96, rose from the dead
628.29,638.13, the world has never been the same since
640.86,645.03, he
