2.79,8.19, the premium the deputy director of another earth middle east
8.73,15.51, offices in montalvan ashland i am deputy director of the tele
15.69,21.48, we are each all organization we are actually the only organization in the middle east with
21.63,24.06, staff in these three areas
24.45,33.78, on any topic and in this case we are focusing on environment as a means to co operation in the region and peace building
34.05,42.48, we feel that climate change because the impact will largely be on water resources both in terms of
42.63,55.2, warehouses more scarce where they already are scarce and in terms of sea level rise this could contribute to greater instability in the region and we see
55.2,60.84, then raise awareness about climate change and its potential impacts in the region
61.35,67.5, action to address this starting now and working into the future as a means to prevent
67.53,74.82, possibility for greater political tension or conflict in the region and towards cooperation and peace building
75.57,83.7, the impact that we are predicted in the coming decades are greater temperature increases
84.03,88.35, water scarcity increased sea level rise
88.65,92.94, to thirty seven meters for example in some areas
93.27,94.41, and
94.95,105.33, increased trout more extreme weather events like floods and other more severe weather events of that kind
105.57,110.13, and by viscount shift from one area to another
112.83,151.05, we started with this paper climate change and a threat to middle east security that was founded by the ape environment group in the united states and if we also have the support of the east west institute and the international task force on preventive diplomacy and we wrote this to create greater awareness both among the public and a long decision makers on the potential impacts of climate change and what can be done both to mitigate and adapt to climate change and why this is a security issue both in the region
151.2,160.11, how can affect political tension as i've mentioned and from a foreign policy in security perspective from other countries like the united states and
160.14,163.14, in europe for example and
164.52,167.88, through the types of projects were conducting that
168.18,170.4, to restore him protect
170.49,177.12, water resources as well as conserve water through projects like rain water harvesting where we conserve
177.33,182.22, resources on both sides of the political boundary
184.2,212.01, we were in a cross border manner in israel palestinian jordan to restore and protect a shared water resources and letting these types of projects will become more important as we see the protective impact of climate change over time and one of our projects the good water neighbors project works in seventeen communities in these three areas with youth adults and mayors
212.31,213.42, to
213.54,226.65, each and all of those levels from a community perspective as well as to influence policy makers from the top down so we were both bottom up and talk down to learn about and
227.19,238.44, it projects on the ground to protect these resources so for example we have rainwater harvesting projects in schools these prejudices concerning water
239.49,248.28, example in jordan and palestine were girls cannot go to school because there's not enough water right now for the bathrooms these projects in naval
248.34,258.15, girls especially to go to school every day we also have reconstructed wetlands the takes sewage and through a very low technology
258.33,259.89, natural way
260.22,269.37, at the siege and then put the water back into the river in a much cleaner way and again that both cleans up and
269.79,278.97, conserve more and restores more water to the water bodies we work it sometimes in parallel in each of the three areas we work in
279.03,295.08, we also were jointly for example we have been very successful throughout the second into this project has been operating for seven years and he has been able to obtain permits to bring palestinians into
295.14,298.23, israel so we have been able to work
298.41,303.42, the political difficulties in the region and on these types of projects
303.54,311.1, we have set up these projects were pretty much in our three officers because we work as a single organization
311.13,313.95, we're very well together and have a
313.95,330.84, similar approach of lash and all of our offices on how to run these projects we also have field researchers that work part time in each of our communities and so they are trained and also were very well together with a
330.99,339.78, common produce very much hope or organization was founded for years ago and if the original man was cope with now
339.78,346.02, theatres of the earth middle east because we are affiliated with the international
346.77,348.33, of the earth
349.38,351.9, organization by name
352.02,353.04, and
353.55,366.75, or created in order to have environmental projects again cross border in momenta projects that poster cooperation and understanding and
366.96,368.97, toward peace building
370.77,382.86, we hope that by creating greater awareness against parting with this paper that we wrote and showing that the potential impacts are not just on the environment but they are also
383.31,387.78, society and in the economy and also on security and
387.81,391.35, all the political stability in the region
391.59,394.53, we are acting to mitigate
395.13,400.89, with mitigation and adaptation in the region and by creating greater awareness
401.19,404.25, of the region so that other countries help
405.0,412.8, nationalisation in the regions particularly for the developing nations and we are working with other organizations
414.66,416.79, so that as israel
416.91,432.21, joins the act as a developed nation that israel in the post twenty twelve period of kioto where all of the countries will be looking at what to do from twenty twelve and beyond because the kyoto protocol
432.42,433.59, addresses
434.73,437.1, twenty twelve
437.31,446.22, israel will look to take on commitments like other developed countries in that time period of twenty twelve and beyond 
446.31,458.61, we will completely stop the impacts of climate change but through our projects we hope that again through mitigation and adaptation in the region and of course other projects and efforts
459.63,462.54, our projects and more broadly to
463.08,466.2, conserve energy and water and
466.44,468.99, cleaner technologies
469.23,480.3, on the supply side that we will mitigate and help without evasion and prevent the most dangerous impacts the scientists are predicting courtier
480.3,485.07, if we do that we we might have laid the most serious
485.31,488.01, political economic and environmental impact
489.15,498.63, we do see climate as a security issue both for the region and for other countries because of the projected impacts and that there may be
498.84,506.79, responses but that all of the countries in the region and beyond need to act collectively
506.97,510.63, to recognize that this is a very real security threat
510.78,513.3, both in the region and globally
