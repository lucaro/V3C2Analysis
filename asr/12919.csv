0.12,26.4, in southeast c this is aldebaran and it's part of the texas avenue in tributary which ultimately drains anacostia here we have a very dramatic example of the impact of uncontrolled store water in southeast c we have these christians which are predominantly sand when uncontrolled storm water hits this and it just blows it out in all this sediment is going to end up down the anacostia eventually likely down in the bay
26.46,57.03, not what we want a name stephen riling i'm going to bimetalism protection specialist with the district of columbia department of environment so this technique called regenerator water cambaceres it is that over time the will just get better the vegetation a comeback we have all these plantings that will mature and the conveyance part of it as you can see is a series of steppes wears these coverture which shall way of slowing the storm water down letting it settle at the sediment seton these pools
57.06,63.39, and these ponds they act a slow the water down they also act to infiltrate the water back into the ground
63.51,73.17, and then also obviously by looking at ningrat habitat for wildlife so that's one of the other goals habitat creation total costs
73.17,74.73, this project here is
75.0,77.19, someone and
77.19,78.81, presently it only took
78.84,80.43, construction
80.52,96.9, less than three months to do the bulk of the construction and planting have been sort of sporadic as needed this tributary which is melcarthus or make way into a creek which is maybe a mile downstream and eventually into the potomac and then the bay so if we can
96.96,99.45, the problems here at the headwaters
99.93,115.14, place to do it we have a very impervious watershed up here and so there's greasin oil from vehicles sediment and kind of fertilizers under coming up the lawn and so we like to slow that downs and hopefully keep it here before it makes his way to the bed
115.32,123.72, a branch which is north east this stream had a history of surly a lot of trash a lot of dumping
123.72,149.37, not a lot of biological life and just a very very poor quality stream this is what you might call a traditional natural channel design the stream restoration structures are designed to deal with high flows in to keep the channel relatively stable during lowther now water flows through here possible for fish to pass through when we have a storm will will happen essentially as the water will rise a peer
150.03,157.11, come over here due to the grating it will tend to fall back into the center of the stream so essentially the
157.38,162.81, drop water comes up here and then it's going to fall in this way over these stones
162.84,167.7, opposed to coming in and turning out the pen this is a band along literature
167.73,173.67, and these basically float on top of the stream and the trash that comes down from upstream will
173.67,176.52, get caught in these structures and
176.52,187.83, because we really want people to value the stream and we know that people some pression litter and just general imperially impacts people's thoughts and their ideas about what their local water bodies are
187.95,202.23, a lot of work to do and the district in terms of stream restoration were restored in the last year and we have four other stream projects in design and we think we can make a real positive impact on the anacostia and the bay over all
202.26,206.37, at times some money but we're well in a way and we expect to
206.4,207.33, any more
