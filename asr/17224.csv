60.21,64.41, temporarily removed the downs about and said it aside
64.77,75.18, a full rainbarrow will weigh up to four hundred pounds and so the area where the barrel will rest must be made to be firm and flat and both dry and wet weather
75.36,84.27, away any grass or other plants and dig down three inches into the soil why did enough to support the barrel plus a few inches on either side
84.45,86.88, level the excavated area
87.15,97.11, and then spread and level driveway gravel until it's about even with the surrounding area now sat down to tinderbox or similar papers
98.34,102.36, wiggle this into blocks into place to give them a firm footing

109.71,112.65, the cinder block to the height you need
112.86,119.16, these blocks will raise the barrel off the ground so the gravity can help distribute the water
119.58,125.1, the rainbarrow on the cinder block so that the weight of the barrel is evenly distributed
125.34,129.75, check that the barrel is level and adjust if necessary
129.96,134.76, miss the distance from the down spout gutter connection to the barrel
135.6,142.44, cut the downs about you removed to fit the distance from the gutter down falconnet on to the opening of the barrel
143.31,157.8, insert the downs out into the gutter above fastened the bracket holding the down stout to the house with the down spout resting on the rainbarrow you may not need to refasten the downs out to the bracket
160.41,166.38, next wrapped three turns of teleclus tape around the threads of the rain barrel placed
167.91,170.58, this helps to make a trip proof connection
171.66,178.29, now screw the food into the rainbow stopping when the connection is snug and the food is upright
178.44,182.73, these are plastic threads so don't over tighten them or you'll strip them
183.09,198.72, insert the screen over the opening of the rainbow this is important because it keeps bugs animals leaves and most importantly the fine gravel that washes off the shingles on the roof from getting into your rainbarrow and clogging the irrigation system

231.78,237.33, dippers and miniature soaker hoses to release the water directly over your plans
237.78,248.82, the kids are made to connect to outdoor foes but as long as your rainbarrel is higher than the plate on a water these kids were well with a gravity fed rain barrel water supply
249.36,253.65, can install trippers which dreader over the roots of the plant
253.86,258.36, so houses that wet water over the roots of the plant
258.66,271.44, you can use these sections of miniature so khost home to distribute water along the length of the tomentosa be placed along a row of plants or wrapped around the roots of a larger plant
272.07,273.9, a quick over view
274.68,279.99, start by inserting the filter water into the fosse adapter for the irrigation system
280.11,291.27, this is particularly important in a rain barrel fed irrigation system because the gravel are great that finds its way into the rain barrel kenealy clog the small openings of the trippers
292.59,302.22, following the instructions that come with the trip arrogation kid attached the distribution line to the adapter and screw the adaptor to the rain barrel for
302.85,307.74, distribute the line so it follows the course of plant he want a water
307.74,324.9, because the system relies on gravity to deliver the water to the plans made sure that the holes runs down hill from the rain barrel posset to the area you wish to water the instructions that come with a kit will suggest typical lay out for your watering situation
