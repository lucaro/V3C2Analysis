2.43,16.53, attention
16.74,69.12, i can use that by introducing yourself and no allusion eyethorne at the news stand a man aristophe ah yes worked at the original and ruinate a bunch of sins in the past made a bunch during that time and now we get to show mamma so we went in was one which it makes in indirectly bring them there to show them yet the way it started was just with kind of like heart grew people and the employees and are friends and stuff a and eventually just led to whoever could bring them by or have some one else bring you would sell for
69.12,83.01, and so with scantlebury like so your photograph sages that is made mostly for the best yes i mean the way that like
83.04,93.99, me but a lot of people i guess were like seeing this wholesale there's kind of serious ones that are like very photo or fall like one
94.14,97.86, a kind of stricter things and then
97.98,115.08, the other cool thing about making scenes distended like the domestic you want you know said hermanitos are some immodestly those are polite best one you know because it's something that like would really
115.71,150.45, yet made otherwise and can't really translate anything else and maybe it's something that you could make like a website for but there's a website for everything so monaco may be something most contenting in yet like the fact that i had some one took an idea small like duida and genteel process of life finding all the work all homesteading in stable and in printing it and then graniteware to like give the people like
150.9,153.99, now when you see it in your hands that's like the
154.38,156.39, the best hands that i think
156.39,163.5, have some of those silly ones in the one that is aesthetic
165.45,169.14, i mean one is
169.59,212.58, pictures for that so holoserica it's on this for the really big one on broadway and i went to that you that're also worked here and like i just happened to go there away with a cousin of mine like flaccidity just realized how coast sitivations like light lighting all grayville sprayed mahalaleel on little tours of men so the sally
212.79,215.67, just photos that we come
215.73,229.95, you know this citadel who also makes a bunch of them nearest i went with him and we descended up taking all these photos and that at some point we had enough and just
230.49,232.86, together you know so
234.0,254.85, you know again it's like really this is like the one that's not done the best but like a lot of people have had a good reaction of emilie you know it's bad it's pointed to her no reason for it to exist there is so you know
255.15,274.71, and is it also in response to this controversy that there was with the fact that they would make large size so i had no idea of it i noiselessly
274.77,298.17, i mean this is my own so obviously you know i like to enough to put it out but there's timanyoni projects in that vain matter here the like they just work laid that the artist's just the one that is like a tourist in his every day life yet exactly
298.29,307.29, and mike i mean it could be that it also just could be like one of the stones like some one just did it you know it's
307.41,310.08, because these are
310.17,325.29, you know those actually aren't for sale sorry i know seenister is the esoterically was out
325.35,341.64, oh ay i know that's what it's the kind of crazy because everybody gets to that might set a bilious free still commandant
343.44,353.97, all different like books artists books and see that people have made and this used to actually be a store that we had in subway
354.72,367.89, reliable we kept one copy of everything as an artist is not there the person is barnaby
368.58,395.73, and it freeholders and because that something theories in a that why we wanted to feel it exactly i basically the leopard we used to sell at all i bogallala it wasn't a lot of money sabatier
395.82,400.71, i mean when it's it's a great thing to be able to have
401.79,403.65, yes of course
403.89,418.53, really versificators how this works neverden from from the rigistan originally supposed to be a store and it wasn't ever
418.59,459.51, i mean also wasn't really supposed to make money we have to sell things i can't do stimulator i was just for all these people to be able to like how something that they could sell and you know tiliaceus it out too which is why it so making her because there's i think twelve hundred titles that we had from the time that we open until we closed and closed the borer you know said hundreds and hundreds of people whose work is in the man and how and how is it different to win
459.96,462.81, pretty different just
463.32,471.57, always one person that comes in that would have never been to be original 
471.78,497.73, usually someone over usually someone who lived in the city for most their life and is just like his own away sanitaetsrat lieutenant
498.0,505.02, earthenware the company was sure
505.23,506.25, he
507.03,507.63, he
507.69,515.55, i mean even like this woman left like an hour ago but is always like one like
515.61,518.58, she said she'd be here since
519.48,530.16, it is so as fairly and sheik i see was were changed whatever and like she says isis cool that it would have been a young
530.55,552.99, anointing there is finally like i think six months ago a new business alone and you have antithetic did tattoo we go like we got some windingsheet like
553.05,557.91, actually do it be comfortable and not have to take money from
557.91,568.71, the article not take a collision is like to your selling for like five bucks like oration in just like doesn't it
569.25,580.05, anastasia behind her we did like selections from all the local stores and a eneid it
580.65,586.71, no they weren't really money was but we say not the satellite
586.8,597.12, and they care the coolish star and in the one and stay so even though they had their story to a very know but
599.25,604.05, you anecdotes
604.32,612.3, he yearned
612.3,623.1, the colegiata to get over here for i know it to the last notion athenian
623.43,630.9, one of everybody right or toothsome nineve again reddish
631.14,643.14, i coachman it's good but you never know like even so all we did the new stand we had peeped this
643.65,646.71, people who made seems years ago sallie
646.83,672.54, though there's a kid died for these things sometimes the just the connection before the internet especially doesn't get maisie the first yet as sitting in a box and there is in the world that are like a cooling international
672.63,674.43, and
675.03,677.34, yeah
677.52,691.29, dissatisfaction on association like a forester sure
693.93,736.38, is that what's common between the one in the subway and in the well in years that does a great deal of talking to people you know people are always very excited to see this and i as usual in her as it is in the in the superterrestrial so it's like very disinclination on you know sometimes people in here it's more like people don't know it so for sale or not for one i know i history or the people that a bit to the original one whereas like the one on the train to be also since we were in between two trains we had a lot of computers like people that walk by every day
736.53,738.72, certain point they would also stop it
739.17,754.02, then a lot of those people i didn't know what any of the stuff as you know so same thing person talavera oneadatote
754.14,757.71, one person may it is you may
757.83,781.62, allentown i get stupider or with kids come with their parents and looked through some analine outcasting out like good this is just tallington like a month later come in and bring stuff the pain to gattleton
781.86,791.34, the thing is can you tell a bit about how what it means for you as an artist to make his benefactions
791.46,795.6, now relating to operas of work that i can make
795.72,803.85, for sure i mean this was like some of the first stuff i did just because he's a most accessible
803.88,813.96, he is made right away you know and a kind of shows you he also have like an anodyne to give it to people you know if
814.08,818.01, you're lucky enough to find a cheap way to make it then
818.16,828.42, essentially given out to three so like helps you gauge what in your work you can working sticking like you feel strongly about
828.6,842.37, silesia that i don't really like now were like consigning all made this out of any interesting project or stolen when whitelocke that
842.4,847.44, i think tis for me personally it was they were like
847.44,874.53, to mediate like you make it your like admitted it and you didn't even stop to make whether i like if you are making the ligating you have to like you too you don't to file the right stuff he created usually takes you know hours days weeks months to do but there were two fettered you like i met
874.92,887.49, it makes a good work attention it all like the all different you know even in my home all the work i have long canterbury play
887.67,910.05, then a quieter and more serious and more of a fool project in the aloneness stupidity like peter soon to he always makes good because i i think like he's one person where he figured out like
912.06,927.87, i know the answer i think the good ones are something that is very tedious experience of bad or something you think of and that's like like that's why i brought a peristyle
928.29,933.57, this lake they are precise presides
934.26,939.72, there is so goodly
942.15,960.63, there was one rather a second ago there is none which stickers all over the cover to see i found a marionette to be a storehouse to be like
960.99,973.41, this guy work always do ateliers a lot of stuff in it it's a lot of stuff and like a lot of our friends similar people i guess like
973.47,975.54, but i feel like most of it
975.66,978.51, from him and let
978.51,981.9, even this like the cover is like all stickers and then
981.9,985.59, planted on like the fact of sedan
986.13,994.89, like cool because you know if you ever go to kings to make copies you all is put him in these envelopes the countrey knows such a
995.1,996.69, it's like we are just
997.44,1003.08, polestar within its printed on the literary paper
1006.8,1009.26, certain things taken from
1009.65,1019.07, other photos it's tex that he believed was taken mostly from like nopal he liked photograph something the pollinctor as a
1021.8,1028.88, and you know it to me this work because it's like so many different things happen and like
1029.66,1037.73, it works for you because you see what is referring to oh i guess yer more like
1038.03,1062.78, like personally and some that i like wot may be not everybody likes the same thing but it's also as you said in the beginning the way that it made that makes them very specifics yeats's almost what you see people like treated as a real work of art like not to sound like pretentious about it i shouldn't know doesn't need to be polite
1063.05,1065.27, the thought into it because it's like
1066.11,1069.41, the old thing is like okay used the setting
1069.56,1088.97, like that is free so it's not like an adonis so like crazy conceptual fine art way and necessarily it's just like part of it as makes it a cheaper thing to manillas better you know and then you could see like the same dumaliso
1093.23,1098.39, it's clean nature in the way that people interest and
1103.7,1123.53, you're all like different things it's natural stuff like rocks but that have been drawn on to yet he first said then it's something like a 
1123.59,1129.98, well inouye i don't know so it's just
1130.55,1133.01, you know sometimes the like stuff bad
