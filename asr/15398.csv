4.74,44.55, i eenamost master office
44.97,46.38, sorry now
47.7,50.04, mister lester is travelling
50.25,85.14, she said he's traveling and catarrhal accretion schedule that enemies were in a tone but oh i must indeed you sure you called her a etnaean idea is definitely to day etiennette
86.37,88.47, you know the word nay
89.07,90.93, production designer
92.37,98.67, sevington 
99.63,117.93, a resistance or editorial
123.6,150.75, i entertained
152.79,164.61, at richard lester movie is like to work on you know what the set of a movie your directing is like quick i trotskyite delusion by saying that
164.94,191.07, there's a kind of exuberance that happens shooting quickly but i really the tree is its panic and it set just masquerading as exuberance that sense that you come in look at the set walk around once or twice and say right the cameras here let's go for it as opposed to saying would be better if as george avenue to to do as to the issue
191.1,201.21, here and there at their theatre and then i'll work out ultimately which is the best way i never had that financial luxury to do that and so
201.45,206.1, i had to take the easing this is the way it only be let let let do it
206.64,223.77, some actors love working away at their are people like to run to come prato a piece of material and george he cottonopolis that and there are some that like to build slowly and developed
224.13,232.74, theatrical manner and that in an that way it's very difficult for them because by the time they've come to to feel comfortable with
233.01,246.27, material of the shooting that day year your tenant another scene number i think george scott is probably the finest actor in my way of thinking that i've ever worked it i think he had an instinct that he would turn up
247.26,250.56, his first rehearsals of a scene where so
251.37,278.49, in science and he caught all the nuances of the material extraordinarily he got bored very quickly and estates used to practice a golf swing and when you start getting seriousness
279.06,305.07, serious of sign language and the pantheon walk through with a cigarette in his mouth riante middle of the take because it would nobody wouldn't tell the two anybody that we were actually shooting i don't know he said about how i won the war at the time that i was released if i fell under a bus to morrow this is the film i'd want to be judged by is it still true having made another fifteen movies since then
305.1,308.34, even after i said that i really
308.88,313.95, and then i left before across the road and i was very careful about but
315.75,322.95, i was very poor the film that i was very proud of what i attempted i know it was a failure in that 
323.76,327.33, large was preaching to the converted
327.39,361.98, by experimenting with a kind of brain alienation i managed to alienate everybody especially the distributor it turned out to be really controversial even old from the theaters and memorial day that response surprised you know we even during the making of it before trinette the script and selling it to newspapers and you know there's pettiest of things going on which meant that there there was a lot of interest in it mainly as wisconsin
362.22,430.41, that sense that making an anti war film film as opposed to making an anti war film that was was very important at some words are necessary they have to be fought for god's sake don't glorify them don't put nice music behind them and half littondale it suddenly decided that they can get on with each other and be the krapotine other siderealised
430.62,437.13, no intent to intention of showing it to anyone who was not going to be a professional film at all and
438.21,451.77, cut it on the operas amateur drummer and we had a fairly comprehensive drum it so he laid all the film out on the kittle leading teaching about the size and
452.43,467.67, he then showed it to one of his friends who was a television critic who said i've got i know somebody who chooses fell to the number of festival won't you finish it and take it up to him and i
467.73,473.91, wrote the music for it and got for jazz friends to play it
474.3,480.93, in the end it cost pounds to do the whole film from one end to the other we got one print
481.44,504.87, took it to advertised saw the adrenalin the entrances co film festival so i then went to the san francisco first then i got the coeordinate because that listenest had this one print that was wandering around said and then it suddenly became a film and then i said well as the pace then not a telemetry more and i film director
504.99,508.11, show it to people who said yes if we ever want ter
508.5,611.52, minute version of running jumping standing filamelle you know so needlessly nobody fell in for about four years economists
612.81,621.39, a copy of the great review that peter bugged out of it for a new york magazine when the three musketeers was released and sent for
621.42,634.47, conveys with admirable grace the view that wars conspiracies battles have always been carried up by those unfortunates who stand to benefit least from the outcome yet who risked their lives none the less for honour king or country
634.53,660.06, suggesting that mister lester's delightful movie is also a political allegory i hope we'll keep knowing out of the theater because it is rare indeed to see a slapstick comedy that is trenchant wit it youth you know we all have our hobbyhorses always something about religion and most of my films is always something about the way that
660.99,664.77, as you were describing his musketeers that 
665.04,677.16, people that end up having to do the work are often the ones that didn't deserve the that fate the three musketeers in the forestiere actually shot simultaneously and originally meant to be
677.61,683.58, as one we had shot two films together at the actors had been paid to do
683.82,685.41, his whole body of work
687.21,690.93, there was in the end
691.62,696.75, there was nothing that i could do one way or another i think probably
697.29,699.99, i would have liked the films to have been
700.8,716.07, one time put back together again just to see whether they worked because they in my mind that's the way they should have been because they started up with very light and went more and more into melodrama and you can see the line quite clearly if you put the two films together
716.55,723.48, one person that's influenced me more than any one else was buster keeping i thought he was an absolute master what what he did
723.72,724.5, and
725.16,726.69, he told me
726.78,748.47, which i've never really practised well which is the economy of thought in that you never in a kenfield has any shot that is absolutely necessary again him in a funny thing happened on the way to the willows offered that part on broadway i didn't want to work in the theatre
748.47,768.75, was it years later somebody had actually remembered that one casting came up to the film that he had been offered to cradle in with both feet where is it like to have them it was wonderful and terrible because you remember him from his work and his great strength and his great physical
768.87,777.24, physical beauty and dexterity and he was nearly seventy and although he didn't know it he was dying
777.39,779.85, and
779.97,806.49, he just couldn't do the things that he thought he could do and had in the end we had to use a fiscal double for him caught a lot of the time and at end up having muster keeton who didn't the spoken words and you had somebody else do the movement with was a travesty but that's the only way we actually could get through it but what he did was with marvelous and we did have one more glorious sunday where
806.97,810.0, we just went out with a small crew
810.0,823.32, into a field outside madrid said to buster anything he'd like to do just do it and i'll see if you know you do it in costume and assyrian find a way to shoehorn the picture and we just
823.62,836.37, and had a drink and sandwiches and shot some material some which is in the film that remains one of those glorious days that you know that makes what you do all worth while
836.4,842.79, what was your way of working with david in
842.79,844.5, i think he is one of the most
844.74,846.87, continuously inventive
846.99,859.26, tentative ever worked with and i worked with some more but to david had the courage or lifted the woman danesford to enough to try anything
860.31,866.34, and he now knew that that i would i would stand by him
866.64,879.9, we've had to fight her way out in very odd circumstances with david is not the stop terribly wrong you know there there endless stories about david you know there is the opening sequence of three musketeers with
880.65,892.26, the focus buller saying what's the top david and he said what other two or twenty two you work it out and the folks be enough to fill decade with it and he had with
892.35,903.78, they all think is that david was right and you know it would look wonderful wide open or closed down totally in the middle or in boring
903.78,929.25, the kalander ful sense of how his photography would fit into the total concept of a film because he conceived the film and over all were as david really was is interested in in the technique of struck photographer and i know nick nick was always interested in everything in filming we always felt very early on when nick was focused hollered say one day were going to be working for him
929.31,932.22, so they were different in that way but
932.91,947.76, nick had an ability if you said to nick light it like somebody else he he could do that or as david really had invented a way of of lighting that everyone else since has been copying
947.79,966.69, he animistic film was a homesick so they knew about me and then they had seen running jumping and standing still film and they liked it
969.78,973.17, so we went to meet them and
975.6,980.67, well enough and the fact that i used to play a bit of pie that 
982.14,989.67, reasonably understanded tearless figure in what do with it knows it it just fell together
989.76,991.05, the good thing about
991.08,1012.71, first elsie is that they were only being asked to do things and represent things that they with which there were familiar you know they knew about presence they knew about rehearsals i knew about pumpion directors you have to give the beetles a great deal of credit for understanding what they were what they could be
1012.71,1023.9, controlling it pretty well and i also they also have a great skill at tiring and working with people all through their careers that were good for them and let the woodenest
1024.32,1027.02, they wanted to do
1027.71,1033.59, that a great skill in that there
1033.62,1036.41, be able to not only to know what they are
1036.53,1044.63, what they want to be and how they want to be presumed to be but to find people that can allude in that and help them
1044.66,1061.16, achieve that what we have to do is to the old ways to artificially separate them and we deliberately set out to give each of the four rather artificial personality traits that the old audience could remember
1061.67,1063.71, to keep them more
1063.77,1071.93, separate personalities so that you'd remember all four in because there is always a danger with groups is that you remember
1071.99,1082.76, one or maybe two people in the group and then the end years later you say well who was the fourth person in that group and you can frame we work very hard at saying well
1082.85,1113.63, george is going to be mean and he'll never him on no throughout these films olever put his hand in his pocket and by a drink and could be the one that was considered cutbill be winked at and ring will be self delusion and the one that moaning causes up the back and nobody pays attention to him and any know you worked we worked hard at that in the scripters
1113.87,1116.87, percent of the rights of their album
1116.93,1126.71, so advance sales of the album made the film already profitable so nobody was worried about the film and there was
1126.74,1147.41, was fun and they were great fun to be with i mean it was hard because luminous on the streets to fill them but we thousand people from nowhere they pop up out of traps and from an dusoloy do one take on anything and then you'd have to go and find another location to do the same thing in some place else because 
1147.89,1168.38, police said we can deal with this so technically it was difficult from organizational have it was held but the rest of the time it was he was great fun they were enjoying marijuana of the time and therefore there was a lot of laughter going on hanging on the plain to
1169.37,1170.45, from the
1170.54,1173.9, start the filming in nice
1174.59,1177.86, my son was three years old at the time
1178.13,1188.84, he was put up with that more and he christliche for seven hours and he laughed for seven hours and then we we landed in new york and they said you got to go through customs
1188.99,1201.02, what and they say you've got to go through customs it's a rule and we'll hear we're only in transient down to lariat i said no no that i go through and they said were not
1201.08,1204.53, going through custom and there is terrible argument started
1204.89,1211.7, in the end the beetles on and nobody we didn't have to go through customs but all the girls had
1211.73,1216.56, at that time it was very popular the sent poor teddy bears
1216.74,1237.8, so they because we didn't get off the planet they all filled up huge luggage skips at the airport with all their tenders and there they arrived at the plain or give all given to my son you know in these undispersed under this mound of too acutely toys while the the boys went back on to the plain and
1237.83,1247.16, from their standard up again they laughed all the way down to nazareth has great memory of being one of the great times of his life
1247.43,1252.32, there was that sense that john had distanced him himself
1253.13,1256.07, from a lot of us
1256.58,1257.9, but
1258.02,1264.59, he was he remained one of the three or four people that i think has had an enormous impact on my
1266.6,1280.31, there he had a personality that could cut through all the nonsense that will speak of this time in he he had he suffered fools very badly and he would he could be extremely cruel
1281.3,1282.5, the end
1283.88,1285.2, there was a
1285.35,1314.24, warmth and a great intelligence and i don't reminisce and a couple of people have been kind enough to try to do some books with me on on the past and i have no memory at all for it i can't i can't remember my own films for well moresques is that come all on television occasionally about monitresses you know and sometimes i've been the subject of the man i've got the least sixty or seventy per cent of the questions on intercession i honestly don't have a good memory for it
1314.33,1355.97, and i don't remember seeing my secretary of say well you remember when you had had that marvelous lunch with birting the conductor and i said well i love burning i did it i like that i like the rain the minute i first left american came to your episode felt that i was i thought comfortable here and i've never left i think one of the great advantage i have had is that i haven't seen most people's films and a i really tried to be the kind of danesfield film studios you know said of savage innocent
1356.45,1398.36, i've never been an assistant on anybody's films i never was all a film said except my own and i never knew how people made films and it was only when i produced the first superman film that i came on the waster director work and i went into a sort of total catatonic shock to her what god's name is this man doing it was so different from the way i worked and it was i just didn't know what was going on on the sadducee out of her i left the stage i think robina is a romantic subject i think it was dealt with in a much more anti romantic way that i'm not a sentimental i don't i don't have any sentiment about my own life that all or yonowsky wife
1398.45,1406.79, i know that i never never did what i said i would do i mean i remember saying in an interview that the one thing i would never do i make a sequel
1407.27,1409.7, i thought that was the worst way of
1409.76,1421.94, films and i've made even of them so you know i still think the principles right but you know you grow up of course and
1422.0,1423.95, things change
1424.07,1425.54, not
1426.77,1434.93, so much that culture changes but the sense of optimism changes you know you won't have to one has to look at films made in the early 
1435.41,1445.82, be ye of someone from the s because we were in a very exuberant time things were good things were being tried we all felt
1446.0,1466.97, there was a fresh wind blowing i keep using those metaphors because spring to mind that one looked looked forward to the future and then when at the end of the sixties when the pain the time with peculiar and bed sitting room the sense of despair the sensation but that that things
1466.97,1470.51, all these movements that were coming up
1470.99,1481.43, that sense that the beetles embodied of that if you want to do something just guided it put your energy into it and go for it
1481.61,1501.41, to see the other side the dark side the tapering and the exploitation of people and the drug culture starting to take over and live at that war and nixon becoming president or the you then have to look at the films made in the late somebody else these
1502.31,1505.25, i do find insufferable the
1505.55,1517.49, the arrogance the assumed arrogance that happens with people who know the answers it important that there is little purpose of
1517.49,1519.02, those of us who are
1519.29,1526.94, given the right and privilege to entertain use that to say to people now wait a minute
1527.33,1532.67, accept this is face value look at it and say am i being called
1532.76,1543.8, you know is this person what he seems to be is this hero really a hero what does he stand for and is it really is a really heroic lesser is there a film
1543.83,1562.07, so you hadn't made that you didn't get the chance to make it work with harold interned a screen play of joseph conrad victory which i think is just absolutely stunning piece of cinchona
1562.13,1575.03, distrust and people were saying well i'll make this one for them and then they'll give me the money and then i can do what i really want to do because you never do attend up doing many many films for them and have in recent years
1575.24,1577.49, back at any of your films
1577.55,1579.29, the able to watch them
1579.77,1586.34, audience and just kind of sat there and watched one of your movies i thought it was a good idea not to to er
1586.43,1588.11, the films again
1588.32,1628.37, every once in a while they you find yourself in the room or some tall television and you start to watch and then i get interested but i find my setting so nervous because i think what you remember is all the things that were going wrong and where you didn't get it right and the thistletons thinking my palms are sweating in it twenty five years later while i am my doing this in the turn it off to give up so i don't really know what my phonsie and i don't know whether they hold up well or or badly or not and i
1628.91,1654.68, at least spare myself the embarrassment of looking at a film and thinking my god look at all these people in behaving in this way and the other thing that sad is that three quarters of the time if you look at the hill most of the people that were there and they were your mates and you suffered with their old dead and you think this is awful you know they
1654.68,1668.03, i feel like to live the life of a successful film director a life which is a very bizarre and so far removed from the experiences
1668.24,1669.8, most people
1670.16,1689.57, and i want to know if you are aware that is bizarre or whether after a while it becomes normal to you i don't think of myself in any way as not not being ordinary i certainly was aware of the bizarre life especially during the years with the ether
1690.35,1691.34, you have
1692.12,1699.05, to go to the senate you had to put a paper bag over your head that's all about i understand that but
1699.11,1707.69, a couple of years and for the rest of my life nobody knows who i am but what i mean is no one would ever freemantle
1708.74,1730.94, filtering the middle of a field with people asking them what the best class they ever taught was that what i mean nowhither difference between this and live this time that peter gets used the same kind of questions and you deal with them in the same way as you know in yourself you're just you know you are what you in it you know you get up you go to the low you have breakfast and you know your normal
1731.09,1733.94, as he remove that you'd like to make now
1734.36,1738.59, no i really i do honestly think it's a young man's game
1738.68,1741.38, i have lost confidence in
1741.83,1744.02, at the
1744.05,1760.19, my ability i always tried to know technically what was going on i always tried to learn what were the new lands is what were the new film stocks how one could use the equipment if there is a thread that runs through things and if there is a thread that runs through my life and
1761.33,1764.15, it embodies
1764.33,1776.96, what i think is important for people to do it is to question excuse me now why do we see a pleasant canal
1779.36,1784.37, that's not the wind obey
1785.54,1798.98, today i am to sit alone here at the great heart beat of a great nation here to day great well served by the fine we walked eighty miles with you and camera great
1800.06,1857.12, trying for it heretofore elaborate
