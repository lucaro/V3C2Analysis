18.18,51.12, a father was making a film but diverse neighborhood
51.33,53.25, some ways i was correct

86.1,89.97, families that baby city at others kids
90.39,96.12, have saturday morning lessons on how to fix your flat tire
96.99,100.56, it's those kinds of things and most of its free
100.74,105.0, tis all in the spirit of neighborhood
105.15,112.74, i think that's what is particular to unpleasant community besides the incredible range of
113.01,116.07, in background that are represented here
116.43,120.06, usually did my grocery shop in
120.72,123.33, pharmacy
123.63,126.75, sort of like daily shopping stuff my dentist
126.81,137.64, pleasant street i got my hair cut to get my hair cut on the pleasant street the shoemaker i mean that's a great thing about me pleases reads prey much everything that you need
138.06,147.51, and it's really rare and i don't think there's another street like that that has all your daily stuff the hardware store yea then i'm going to some the restaurants
148.26,155.16, living there and everybody has to expectations of what they expect of me pleasant so that
155.76,158.4, a lot of crossing in a lot of
158.43,164.82, with each other but this also a lot of tension between them of these groups and you know the
164.85,174.54, people have more power than other people to let it play out in strange way i became much more identified and much whiter and a little less black
174.78,189.75, when i got there in the night as i got their right after the riots and you know so it wasn't really quickly getting wet through the nineties of started thickly after the metro opened and i ain't two thousand was really the
189.9,196.71, the time when things really started changing you know property values started exploding i guess
196.74,199.62, change but it has been seen
199.92,213.63, when i was first moving in here i moved in after a lot of negative things had happened to my pleasant verascope that were the rites and the generally was just
215.22,217.59, wasn't doing to 
244.14,250.95, certainly nineteen sixty eight exposed
252.48,258.81, before the racial tensions within the city the city was going through
259.08,260.97, rapid turnover
261.54,268.62, and yet there were many things happening that positive in the city but certainly in the black community
268.92,273.36, along the night record or george avenue
273.81,280.11, florida at the section florida an things were not going so well and
280.17,285.21, had been before that there had been disturbances but certainly 
285.24,296.85, not just naturally but here in the nation's capital there emerged their great concern and so remember bill clinton saying he is a student and
297.09,302.01, go up to hear and look out you can see the smoke rising from
302.19,311.67, there from the burning buildings that were current so that was that was and then election in a very different context
311.91,314.73, a latin out by
314.97,334.05, an african american police woman brought something else to the four that was there was problems along the ascham's morgan and that float over into mapleson because it was right on the border with it boothose were part of a broader moult
334.2,337.38, history in this city that been there
337.44,341.88, tenth century and from the african americans and then in the
341.88,355.05, as one with other groups particularly latinus that was morganatic a barricader are there a very different one than the african american one which was much more historical
355.2,356.79, for
357.06,361.8, waters are the boys had much different kind of
362.58,377.76, gloria because it's changing all stillman
398.34,404.22, after nineteen ninety one i thought things became more harmonious about pleasant
404.76,407.13, so sure about that either
408.36,419.73, what happened and he thievery tricky what happened and where the agreement came up around after the so called disturbances he cut right we were you know
419.85,421.59, the whole story
422.13,426.15, and all of a sudden small groups had all you know we're going we're going to
426.75,428.82, we going to interest this
428.82,430.95, in the addressing his
432.57,442.14, controls on the local restaurants i mean it was his way of all of us and ethelyn this is an element of our community that we don't like not restaurants per se
442.62,449.82, where will the latin clients that they would attract more latino come here and we bring me more lenora restaurants
450.33,451.98, going to get out of the control
452.16,453.93, where it all started
455.52,460.35, the agreement and then i just been just on very rigid and a dog they got very nasty
464.58,466.98, there's a curiosity here of a
467.16,469.62, a small park right next to my house
470.82,475.65, and the recent parents as a promenade there they be good neighbours
477.72,478.89, come
479.13,482.19, the place they've been good negresses
483.6,485.58, that little
485.88,490.38, and which is at peace among lamotte was never opened ever paid
490.68,492.45, at least two people are house
493.23,494.49, the french
495.09,497.37, they had control over it they could use it
497.55,499.14, there was a firing
500.52,504.42, the people who came in from the suburbs and said
504.51,505.8, things
506.46,508.5, to steele
509.91,513.69, and to put a play ground there and in nothing is played round
514.56,517.8, they never talk to anybody in the permanent
518.13,524.91, a lot of those people didn't weren't particularly community minded so i know one of your questions was
524.97,531.36, is it a community and i think it's you know it's changed in that sense
531.45,533.43, some ways because
533.7,536.91, got the sort of influx of people who
538.02,545.25, didn't think of the place they live as being part of the community like to them i was sort of a refuge you know
545.25,582.63, you come home you have your friends from other places but being part of a geography based community wasn't an you know wasn't something important for that too
582.63,596.49, the
599.19,613.53, toronto
614.43,634.41, the boer
634.59,639.24, because the people who moved in from outside the goblin from suburbia
639.54,642.06, are your little guest professionals like me
642.72,646.02, now how to access the political system
647.61,649.8, the ones who enter
649.95,653.52, the ones who know out to call up their couplers and get things done
654.21,655.89, who are active
656.22,657.51, take over
658.32,663.84, people these people are relatively modest unsophisticated background don't know how to do that
664.77,666.6, then a great disadvantage
667.44,669.45, that's what i decided i had to do something
670.86,672.87, andy and that was
672.93,677.58, but by two thousand men to the huge battle over the paper
679.74,684.69, it was i that i decided that the ceded a voice where the people who weren't
685.74,687.15, one
688.5,692.46, by prosperity
693.48,695.61, i speak for the people who aren't
695.97,702.75, every art speak with people aren't any meetings are not enough going to meetings is not
703.11,711.15, things that people you know the part of your everybody's culture and when we go to meetings i grew up in mexico where you
711.72,713.79, speak in the spoken to
714.24,715.92, everybody pastime
716.1,720.42, you know me i you know a little bit of it meeting her not the way
720.48,722.43, most people
722.7,725.13, specially if you're talking about
725.4,727.02, so people
727.11,730.23, come from a lot of looting the come to his
730.65,731.55, city
731.91,733.59, urban area
733.59,737.94, gone to the sandemanian their own country
738.15,745.71, there you know the dumped into washington d c and probably that's why the porter responded
745.98,751.23, in the festival and the organizing the community citizens
751.44,755.04, i know how it works they have the language that the other thing you have the language
755.37,756.3, it
756.36,761.73, of course i mean you have people that are retired people to have higher incomes and have time to go to meetings
762.63,765.0, they're the ones that started having the voice
765.27,766.41, problem
766.89,768.33, who has time
768.57,769.83, unter
770.04,773.58, and advice renewed commission job with a lot of work
775.38,776.49, of time
778.71,781.92, with an which are dominated by
781.92,783.9, white little class ocasional like me
785.1,788.58, and it's very hard to get anybody else i mean we were
789.21,791.04, her heart had getting
791.55,794.46, from the minorities to retrace
794.46,795.72, impossible
796.8,800.88, because they just don't have the same kind of resources arichat we have
800.91,803.76, this makes the stouter
804.42,824.88, class professional there is also a kind of tension about a people who rent as opposed to people who own your personette viewed
825.75,837.6, and there's a lot of mixed feeling about people who come into the neighbourhood and went group houses or a rent apartments in ah in basements and in the
837.66,859.02, buildings what's going to happen to the apartment buildings when the hispanic population disappears is an issue that on the horizon i think whether these will get turned into condominiums or not who's going to come and live in them and so you knows
859.02,869.82, the neighborhood i think the kind of people that you're talking about us for susan i think that might be from some of the long term residents i feel on the border because i am a young person
870.48,882.0, and you know i could be perceived as a cause of generation even though you know i have a very humble means and i'm just living in this tiny you know so apartment
882.12,885.0, i may not look or be
885.57,948.27, what the heritage of man pleasant is used to heretofore to tell her to a forfeiture
948.81,965.04, i think these last serves are supposed to you know take the place of the back yard over the back yard fence conversations among your friends and neighbors i think the liseron we had we have a list serve on the website we have a huguenot
965.04,975.18, for a number of years before i got too busy for me i was doing a sort of a moderate you know muleteer so news letter about neighborhood
976.95,979.05, obviously they don't reach
979.11,980.97, everybody 
981.0,988.62, i have to be able to either have access to either at work or a library or a cyanometer
989.1,992.67, william lost
992.97,998.61, unfortunate certain people certain sequences of the population i do honest
998.61,1003.74, i do know letter which i hand deliver all over my district
1004.37,1005.93, copies
1008.72,1009.77, this
1009.86,1013.01, my communication with everybody not just
1014.15,1015.56, a lasso
1015.8,1016.85, everybody
1017.18,1018.56, no letter
1020.39,1023.03, what's going on because i tell them what's going on
1024.35,1026.81, they can call me they can talk to me in time
1027.53,1039.41, i spent a lot of time on foot minnigerode so old people neither really big problem is that weariness properties noontimes ah the langannerie
1040.13,1043.22, the owners forgather probably of pennsylvania
1043.4,1046.31, that's not a very healthy
1046.43,1050.03, situation you know you don't really have any carrying
1050.3,1056.87, carrying and just responsible landlords and again the city does not have enough inspection people to go round
1057.38,1058.64, he
1060.17,1062.27, but shelterless
1062.78,1064.55, my back
1066.08,1067.4, now you've got the
1069.2,1071.63, one of her street is one of the park road
1073.04,1074.42, and
1076.97,1079.52, certainly sources of troubling
1079.7,1080.99, it
1081.41,1083.9, yet they've got to be some place
1084.68,1086.42, down move him out
1087.2,1089.21, to make your incoming population
1091.22,1093.83, part of building started to get more crowded
1095.24,1099.38, where you might have had five people within in an apartment
1099.47,1109.04, i might have had eight or nine people living in that same apartment there were also people who were renters
1109.19,1111.32, who were sort of
1111.74,1113.48, financially
1114.26,1130.82, sort of in terms of their life as ready to buy a place and one salutant couldn't afford it you know said they moved generally east and bought a place and then there were people who are sort of in that same situation in other neighborhoods and
1130.97,1148.7, pleasant was basically like the western most neighborhood that they could afford to live in and all pleasant is a community a community that like a family and like most families there is a lot of dysfunctions part of it there was a lot of amazing warm compassionate generous
1148.76,1150.62, but there's a lot of
1150.77,1152.75, difference of opinion
1154.07,1155.63, represented as well
1155.66,1163.52, and one thing that i saw about my pleasant right away once i moved here that it was immediately clear when i visit it
1164.96,1166.76, trompe
1166.88,1169.4, and people use it different
1169.43,1171.98, everybody in a different interpretation
1172.43,1185.93, i bowed and they all you know memorials memory i think now because they are renommee what they want to remember in a way they went to remember him but of course you always want situate themselves at the head of it
1185.99,1188.63, i would talk to a
1188.75,1195.74, of course he told me this great story about your taking over the government you know and
1195.8,1200.78, in a foreign withall overcome with business again his way of writing history
1200.87,1210.08, gaining the upper hand gaining the power i mister march like a gaily book of a who has control
1210.26,1211.61, the discourse
1211.61,1214.16, this course profligate
1214.79,1223.61, the people that have control of the discourse are the ones that are creating the story people have this vested interests in
1224.45,1226.76, creating themselves as
1226.76,1230.18, like the core of the neighborhood and
1230.27,1240.23, ay that they one of the ways that they do that is by giving the neighbourhood a certain identity so in slavocrats his identity for the neighbourhood
1240.41,1253.37, in your in your quest to create yourself in some way you leave in your way this this particular identity for the neighbourhood but then that would take on a life of its own and
1253.4,1262.88, we can pick that you know that story of an sit in all kinds of ways that are detrimental to the neighborhood without any thought of intirely accurate
1263.45,1265.88, some cases it might be but
1266.09,1270.53, can't just assume that it is so it really has to be investigated
1271.01,1278.12, eaton
1288.62,1295.19, i i
1298.46,1313.37, tatiana
1338.57,1356.6, eatanswill in associating so i was really interested in how people talked about the neighbourhood and
1356.75,1360.26, how people created and identity for the neighborhood
1360.29,1362.36, sort of use that
1362.78,1375.65, lay off of in terms of creating an identity for themselves as legitimate community members and identities for other people as coronation members you know so i was like
1376.91,1385.64, what kind of place is not pleasant who's remplacant person who's a fake mountpleasant person and who should have the right to decide what should happen in the neighborhood
1385.73,1389.93, i was really interested in you know the relationship between those three parts
1391.19,1394.46, what i found i found is that
1395.24,1403.61, for as of a thing not pleasing is very unique in that there is a very high proportion of people who feel like
1403.67,1408.74, they are members of this committee who identify themselves as
1408.86,1410.69, pleasant people
1410.72,1422.21, eaton
1444.2,1448.37, i 
1452.42,1453.11, he
1475.34,1480.62, first started this thesis i thought i was making a film about a thriving community
1480.65,1511.28, however every rose has its thorns and not pleasant is no exception there are serious problems facing the community that needs be adjusted but almost every one and that over the course of making this film was proud to be a mountpleasant person
1511.76,1606.14, the
