80.88,93.72, so stansmore from time at may be can give us one of your most memorable experiences of events from the time you were you were attending she
94.32,107.07, let's see i guess one of my most memorable events as i cannot see something so pleasant but its memory there were two three of us in the class there weren't 
107.19,112.17, the best physical specimens of young boys in their
112.2,127.26, sixteen seventy year old and me and haunches were always in a special group and we had to work only on a few things if i remember correctly it was pushed up and pull up
127.5,132.57, and mister miller and afterwards mister ashcraft were
133.2,144.6, very hard test rivers i mean or as turned out to be a friend later on when we got together here and the us but remember was sheer hell
145.86,152.7, i was on the sacred that didn't seem to make much of it but i remember he was a miss
152.88,157.71, but but condemnable 
157.77,164.76, okay how about perhaps in the bigger scoutings and a new being in japan
165.03,191.34, i would not jennison and memories of you know maybe with the carolineans specialising in japan and where were you living and some of the experiences of memories that you remember from that time embraced
192.69,203.01, from knowing each other personally we didn't know much about each other's families that only happened i think after he reconnected i don't know whether you know but our class
203.31,215.07, through the efforts of candy whitecap aisles passed away three years ago stated in touch for a long time she made every effort to get an all the
215.55,231.66, addresses and current addresses of our graduating class and tilted every five years we get together and can't connecticut and joy brownsover and it's quite an amazing in one when
231.99,255.84, i would say even as are more of us are in touch and twenty thirty musket together on the east coast over a weekend in summer on the every fifth year or anniversary and so that's quite amazing but i mean i started the story because of the kids who are on
255.84,265.59, we did indeed very much so my father we lived in kittie lived at the top of tolerance
267.48,276.09, we used to get the bus in the morning red door shane's office and it would be
276.39,294.81, later his junior and senior by a few of us in our plans lucile to and gordon and oneadatote right to school it was explicit was very different the marsport go down to automatic the attain to a sort
294.87,298.17, so there was that was always fun
299.49,304.02, living growing up in japan you know we knew we were always different
304.35,317.49, as much as you know i was born there and at the time spoke you know very collapse because they didn't trojans language
318.9,320.79, i can think
321.12,323.31, and that was in
323.67,337.02, that they actually started to uintah gentles and high school so i tell the newer oftener basically being trained to get to to schools either the us or
338.43,343.02, prince of the few people who hear and talkin
343.8,347.67, everybody was basically headed back to the us the majority of its
347.73,350.7, that's what we were being trained to
351.03,352.56, to prepare for
357.24,383.04, as to a destiny and honestly the score on the mountain you know i went to the feast man made island so i only heard about different episodes of the location of the scowmen talk more about will you remember about the physical location the school on this mountain and like how that with affected your experiences
383.28,407.28, well from this there were two ways and get up the really steep road that went that was near the cemetery and the one that came by the dam and the bus would take the by the dam and when you want to to get on witwatersrand took the steep hill down oftener but i remember the hills were very steep
407.76,423.18, remember the campus especially after the month steadiness built i remembered a portail be plain basketball after school for hours on end emanated taking public transportation back home
423.48,430.23, remember the dam and all the activities that went on over their news constant in one
430.26,432.87, escape i guess that
433.02,436.14, i was probably
436.14,439.26, the more conservative
439.35,441.24, students there
441.51,444.39, and i probably did not
445.44,448.77, risks as much as other people did
451.95,459.81, we brought her lamented and after every day so we brought our lunch and so therefore you know there was always
459.84,474.66, i myself if you are the people you know in just sitting eating in the classrooms or outside the ear i think i do yearning this carnival
474.78,481.89, might have been before but those of the years that i remember and then we had an obviously the talent or you that i
482.22,485.37, myself and kenyon
487.35,489.69, see one one
490.17,491.67, i 
491.79,493.53, and
493.59,510.81, so the cause was relieved was really nice to was the very attractive tudor style of building that was the man to see main building and then the additional building that went up in my freshman and south are there was a prevailing of went on the neosho there
510.99,511.95, and
512.25,515.46, i know the names of some of these people there
516.27,531.15, the students that were like pure american you know i just saw them as americans i love library because i'll be able to go to the best where you read sports illustrative alessandro unction to america so they remember the
531.24,535.92, cover the football covers you know the players from land
536.61,541.65, so those that wonderful things are we we saw
541.89,543.15, and
544.11,566.55, the other was soft larger year a fellow john locate the class in all her brother walter john and i became fast friends john got into trouble at school and he was allowed to stay only on condition that he lived at home and no longer the dark and he and i tutored him and mad
566.55,568.47, and
568.71,588.66, america very close friends and he was sort of my you know open my eyes about america you know the truth he lived in predetermination from your friends
588.72,615.9, so that the point of that is that the american pharmacy on to road and the international shop in nemoralis candies and all these imported products were talking about the latest
615.99,621.66, you know just being imported some things being important for the first time
622.08,628.14, his colossal like lucile and candy who had access to the p
629.73,658.08, and they could get all american products any time they want it at prophecies the basic change so let there's an american base of the wisner can basingstead thereafter so if there's a reconnaissance like a store you know not only a grocery store with probably see it all american produce
659.34,670.2, yes very cool if you are poisoned you want to bigotries to like catching cold air was then he got access to the basic change was
670.95,672.21, is
673.86,682.62, reinecourt start cause every talent
682.71,685.8, alterative as a clap
686.04,704.04, then you okay all into ask you if you had a particular person or may be a teacher or a september or some one from sea who you better member as you know learning for being inspired by doing you times

731.19,733.2, we were the democrats
733.44,736.32, frederick loves smart is
736.71,743.61, and but i remember he was so wild everything about him was so
743.7,745.86, a convention
746.01,780.51, it was fascinating and he richard bruce was my class and myself and others would get into a lot of argument in some of them i don't remember by member went particularly about making value judgments in history and writing history and to mean we would go up and he would take one side and then when he felt it was convenient he would start ainter side again so you refine yourself arguing against herself unwandering bateese went on to become a photographer and went to vietnam and came back
781.92,785.82, visages infantry a few years ago
786.3,791.13, we we stayed in touch with

857.25,859.74, the americans and
860.01,874.74, at least for me i don't maybe for some other people as well you know the american students were very very especial because they represented what we
