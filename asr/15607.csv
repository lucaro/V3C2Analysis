21.9,23.97, ever
27.09,31.56, did not kill my best friend i did this member him
32.43,35.52, she apace with my gun
35.79,36.87, for
37.59,39.45, emediately 
39.45,43.26, i durst for happy to retire apart
43.44,44.82, as a woman
46.26,48.45, there's
48.45,50.55, attention on him
51.09,55.65, inestimable in thinkable 
56.04,67.65, doing a lot of research you make opinions do not those opinions down you constantly trying to undermine your own thoughts about it you try to search through this information to try to figure out what the truth is
67.8,74.04, many times i thought he was guilty in the making of the narrative film and in the main the jenks and
74.1,76.38, when i thought he may not be guilty
76.44,81.15, as obviously learned more in this story i got more and more convinced 
81.75,90.69, what's your first memory of that night that your mother died
90.9,103.11, father came and got me and he said i am on over here for to that he see rome and we looked out a hall window out on to the roof
103.95,105.6, there was mammy
107.22,113.58, for
113.7,119.16, i never forgot it i mean it happened i was there i saw it
119.64,121.17, i saw
121.71,124.11, never left me
127.08,133.74, a little pit falls in places that he didn't want to go and yet he wanted to make it appear that he had no secrets
134.16,139.5, that was the challenge that was trying to ask the right questions and the right order and we spent a lot of time
139.68,141.99, i like that order ought to be and
142.08,148.5, second guess where he was going to do and then and then organized a question in such a way that we would get what we have it
153.39,156.96, the downside to sitting down and doing an interview
156.96,163.5, the upside the down side of giving an interview is at the interview were
163.65,164.55, will
164.58,168.39, what i've said to make me look as bad as possible
168.96,172.56, side is that there will be
172.74,175.5, something out there from many
175.59,181.74, i will be able to tell it my way and somebody is reasonably open
182.91,190.2, a different story or a different situation and what has been put in the media
190.41,213.99, an opportunity to believe it is enormously charming and that something that you don't necessarily anticipate when you just hear that somebody is a triple homicide suspect and he's funny he is very clever and he knows where you're going many steps before you get there the minute you mention a piece of evidence he is already
214.29,221.07, rough and figured out how i can try to counteract that piece of evidence by the time you get to question number five
221.19,232.2, that's challenging and what makes it most compelling than certainly this had real consequences or that really it really change things i think for
232.23,236.28, as well as for obviously for orders and the families that
236.37,238.38, that were left in his wake
