276.99,294.63, the experience and they have well borer one of the important aspects of my project that i'm really interested in his theresas of citizen in such a limited definition of what citizenship is it the bare minimum
295.5,336.69, doesn't talk doesn't address the people who are citizens doesn't address the kinds of citizens they are and for me it doesn't address how citizenship is performed in the city every day thereafter teetotalers
337.77,347.01, i was quite surprised that easier was for me to work with people that people were so willing to participate because
347.25,358.23, africa you think african migrants and are they the invisible they are the prejudice against the die on the borderie things happen

378.51,383.43, one of the important parts of this project as i don't just want to come and
385.53,387.93, meet the people and just
389.76,397.62, a project that represents or presents to everybody what's happening for the right to kind of dishevel their
397.77,401.22, the sort of struggle there facing
402.72,405.54, through the process of immigrating
405.57,410.4, a lot of them for example don't have residency status and
410.49,412.08, are in the process of
412.17,413.46, to get it
415.65,425.82, that our project as i want to be sort of learn about their lives learn about them it has to be meaningful for them as much as myself
