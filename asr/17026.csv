19.68,26.34, i just wanted to tell you that i've been reading everything that i could for the past couple of days
26.37,30.09, even watching can which i hate a sorry
30.09,36.6, i liked him when i liked it when he turned he was running it i can't stand the
36.72,51.21, that they are doing now but i been watchin sea and because i really want every word to see then to what this new phase of our political life is going to be so some of the things that i noticed
51.66,59.55, some of the phrases that sort of game on to was that we are in a new era of responsibility
60.0,68.52, really kind of a wonderful challenging ethical thing to be thinking about this versus and title mentacom placene
68.58,82.44, we were a man these people will show how long they been not complacent and many of you have n't been complacent for a long time but i think it's it's sir we are a little bit and titled and i think there we have to kind of think about that
82.74,92.25, i think the one of the other things that they were talking about that we are about to tap into the deep well of american optimism
92.37,118.95, what i mean that's what brought immigrants like me here that deep well of american optimism that it was possible to do things here that a way this was a country that reckoned us those ameliorator poor your huddles literally and we came here and we we tried to figure something out it within the american system that is still in revery one on earth so 
119.1,127.53, there is also there was also a very interesting word or phrase which is there is work to be done
127.83,139.77, one there's nothing more wonderfully challenging than for us to feel that we can do meaningful work and this wonderful phrase called a spirit of service
140.25,145.77, which is really a beautiful beautiful day to think about so
146.31,164.52, week i was reading the news letter from public architecture which john peterson the founder and president and at of the book talked about out every week every month rather and
164.85,172.29, down turns there is no less potential for innovative public interest design than during the best of times
172.38,179.37, argue only it is during these challenging times when public interest design is needed the most
179.46,193.32, for farms with unexpected staff pounced staff capacity that comes with the projects lowdown pro bono projects can be good for business and great for moral
193.59,215.64, firm and non profit registrations with the one percent program reminded that remain strong in december showing both high supply and regimentation program the folks from parkinsonia how they participate in that end and unsurrendering to the same thing
216.18,228.03, voluntaries and public service heard of what we're going to be talking about so i hope that we are going to talk about that
228.42,238.5, he went on alice up and i'd like to introduce them one by one in no particular order i have always pronounced his name step adonis
239.1,245.55, come on up steve steve i have no steep but but day's work
247.71,277.98, really when he started jersey devil and did skilled craftsmen work with killed craftsman architects inventors artists and has been doing that kind of work ever since he is he represents to night he represents the educator's segment of our audience and his teachers everywhere from portland the pacific northwest college of art decoration
278.49,292.26, and he's done work and seattle so steve steve is husband and activists and it continues to be activities not tired he still gets a cargo of it so
292.56,298.23, being here eric ran mailman where are you eric please come up
300.48,329.82, his work was was and is a lot of it is a single family housing but one of the things that had that and multi family as i was and town hall so it got it goes through all the income groups when one of the things that correction and the brancas attention for the book is his work were habitat for humanity a wakontas his design for 
331.02,337.05, projects for in roworth carolina for habitat humanity which is
337.35,345.03, but i understand the largest home developers in the united states so there's a lot to be done there
345.09,347.34, cartaret
348.0,353.91, romances a new title he is director of design for the form
354.33,385.5, still case ortheris that at the end james lucilla the power house of design thinking the new power house of design thinking it looks and what interesting is the that great background which is which also held an industrial designer which he is to think about prodding about people in a much more inclusive way he lives
385.53,390.63, australia and even in freedom wisconsin 
392.07,406.02, so in this troubadour friend so and then no outside now he's in grand rapids so welcome bread and then we have fasted bills
406.2,445.71, how many of you know he is also trained as an architect he a planter developer hepatitis is what sort of was really interesting to me that he studied at the coleorton paris and then he studied french civilization and interior design and architecture and he becomes a sort of a renovator of historic product projects in a later and is involved in a lot of community groups here in the lanes this kind of wonderful education actually benefits all of us
446.28,449.49, welcome bill and david green
450.15,454.08, he is an architect with perkins and will
454.5,464.07, he he focuses a large scale planning and what is what his bocas entitlement projects
464.07,467.25, i hope never to use that word again
467.43,495.0, i think that sort of sort of a really difficult word for us now to think about i think design activism is much more interesting than that but he is also very much interested in the fruition
497.37,516.57, okay okay and then we have a set of three respondents who are who are here to add to the conversation and become involved with us in the discussion as you will
516.69,522.9, we kind of state the talkers with perkins and will people
523.05,537.15, because of this i surprise of one per cent for pro bono program that they have adopted in that they're doing some really interesting things with perhaps because of that so christianae you 
537.48,539.7, as your face now
539.88,554.88, he's with foresail and ryan gramarian parkinson will and he's the graduate alaciel project and that the kid is the one blame it all on him
555.48,560.16, when the neighborhood fighted out and then we had plenty
560.64,565.74, the sallow to the folks and if she so
566.16,578.58, actually the executive director of the community design sent a planter and is fairly new to her planters and she's looking at the needs of low income
578.82,611.91, low income neighborhoods and the application of planning research and designs kills to these to those needs so and then she is obviously a very strong advocate for those for those people so we could use her certainly we could use all those hills so run now what i'd like to do as i'd like to start with asking the panel in general and maybe will will first be kind and asked for volunteers and then on the panel
611.94,613.86, no i just call on the
614.28,621.81, but one of the things that has happened which is really interesting for me and i think for all of us
622.11,623.25, that
623.85,649.68, something changed on january twenty years and i think too we need to recognize that there may be no opportunity for us to think about expanding the the roll of architects and architecture and all of us in the kind of new environment that developing around us so i like to ear as well maybe i'll start with stepan
650.43,667.89, and to talk about education what has changed on january twentieth in terms of education how how you i mean you you have the large the broad perspective that that probably a very few of us have on this what is different now
668.58,676.11, a couple of days but i have an sustaining 
678.42,680.01, i
680.07,681.51, educator
681.78,685.68, i think i've never been a shortage in the part
686.91,689.19, responsible
689.58,694.35, naithing they wanted us those bills
694.86,696.93, in serciety
697.02,703.35, loosening cocoa
706.65,708.15, he really
708.96,714.51, aunt
714.63,720.42, we try and hear them that overpower in school and i think it can happen now
725.13,729.48, other are going to be gentle
729.78,732.15, within
733.59,741.24, a programme mishanter will be in his
742.92,752.85, abundantly in private stuff batrachian butter
753.3,765.09, to continue you've been talking to your students so you may lecture you be here talking to some
765.09,773.37, one joins the rule of what was the mood of the room there
773.79,774.93, the students
775.41,776.7, really 
776.79,787.8, was excited to see well i essomenoisi and noticeable a different way of doing architecture
790.5,792.57, i love
792.69,795.99, i alone working for it rose
796.44,798.69, so
798.99,802.65, transition to practices we don't give me prepare to do that
807.66,818.19, yeah that's that's pretty bad actually sometimes my dog
819.27,825.15, so maybe eric in terms of housing what's possible 
826.08,832.05, it was possible to day or to morrow and the next year and the next few years years
832.08,835.92, can start what can we start thinking about in terms of
835.98,841.74, those you know the expedients would have attachment which is 
842.16,846.6, for housing for people who have actually really needed
847.5,848.76, a huge
848.76,852.87, orchomenos to
853.08,855.66, housing
856.77,859.26, an encouragement
860.1,866.25, i thought environment ability to northern 
866.64,868.05, in
868.11,873.72, i see some of the profits picking up on that and actually leaving a little bit of the charge more so
873.9,875.7, then
875.88,879.39, housedame
879.54,882.06, more than just putting on 
882.06,882.81, he
884.04,887.79, haines
887.94,892.53, i think it's really important to remember that you
892.56,899.28, you practise design skill you're talking about you know great life
899.49,903.24, you know energy performance and these houses
903.39,908.64, really important things that people actually need and take you and
908.76,910.8, decrease their
910.83,914.64, payments their bills so i mean i think what you're offering
914.64,921.9, very straight on architectural solution and also beautiful when it also incredibly useful
924.48,930.75, nothing is as gondremark
931.23,932.91, i
937.17,939.81, i
942.15,945.27, he as well as their doing
947.34,949.68, i
951.72,953.64, resources
957.45,960.66, small community
960.78,963.9, thou
965.64,970.5, the standardisation
978.63,984.48, let's go to david green who deals with large scale contained well
984.54,1000.56, what are you saying here i mean my experience with the big firm in recent months is that they are suffering the great deal of difficulty that the intelligent few months 
1000.62,1006.53, how is this this sort of new energy that has been infused in our side and in our
1006.53,1010.76, thinking of helping helping you all at freewill
1011.12,1021.71, interesting case i disordering a parting well into summer first so i really can't answer that question but i do want to and the reason i about paris orally for partisan will and love herself
1021.74,1028.97, but the reality is the question is how this is changed with a booming on what really happens we have somebody with intelligence in the office right now
1029.21,1036.08, and seriously and there the two words i come in about this and one of them assisted nature of a sort of political
1036.14,1038.99, not the politics of the democrats and republicans but
1039.05,1043.85, as prior to each of us individuals that thing that all is collectively together
1043.88,1045.83, a
1046.07,1051.56, what we had to do as architects fall back on the notion of design is this kind of
1051.59,1057.68, i westover issues that we got a salary
1057.8,1060.35, difficulties
1060.44,1077.99, i would hate to see us squander this opportunity to write poitrinaire about this i mean to mormonism five years is supposedly we have gotten one thing built affected his batteries we can understand the sort of collected nature of this process
1078.08,1081.38, i really think a boma is going to be able to come in and say look
1081.59,1097.13, awarding due made sad and out reason and logic to create an atmosphere within which not a fearful atmosphere but an atmosphere of as you say a sort of red passion but we can start to see these things develop
1097.34,1101.72, in that were not doing this right now we are losing natural resources 
1101.84,1114.26, we can't get one mile track git right in those of the sort of questions that we need to ask ourselves if we really want to make a difference in the world and that is expanding architecture that salutes students
1114.29,1117.62, what teaching students for the last seven years i don't
1117.65,1125.93, what people say face bad but make them explain why it worked this just because somebody says something does not make it so you have to prove it works
1126.38,1130.85, i think i think we're talking about not just self interest
1130.94,1143.06, community interest as itself interest with interest in the larger idea of one the one or relationship to the earth at each other that i'm so what's the one thing that's been sustainable in
1143.06,1164.0, in audience is heard this before what's the one thing this sustainable in savannah new york philadelphia is the sitooation of the public round right on ontario undifferentiated landscape that thing that exists or times not the individual project and as long as we fetched vidual project we're never going to get a right because we're to set these things up there unsustainable
1164.06,1170.15, architects designers we fail to ask ourselves that is a difficult question it has been in the curriculum for
1170.27,1187.19, before it had slowly re emerging in the curriculum is not an architectural process historically although it was fired by we've lost that will were trying to do as recantation of architecture is getting back what we had years ago with thousand years ago and years ago
1187.85,1200.72, it's also very interesting to me because most of you have been educated in modern in modernism which was all about reaching out to a large group of people and understanding the needs of
1200.72,1209.48, society and somehow when we translated a terrific something else so i think we have to go back to those
1209.63,1215.69, principles that we that underlay be learned in a faulty manner because it was about
1215.93,1217.4, some
1217.67,1227.48, architect building modern buildings but but still it is there it is there and in a very much interested in the hitting the history books again
1227.51,1230.0, figuring out what to do about that
1230.0,1246.89, i think that one of the things that i actually i'd like to kind of jump to the industrial design because industrial design is allowed reaching more people i mean a product can reach more people can aforementioned individual
1246.89,1257.75, then the building of building as a long time it has a huge sort of expense the tacit so he brought him development the product is more accessible
1257.84,1268.97, and i think as a large amount of factor in the middle of the country that is kind of looking out from your grand pyramid in a cornfield
1269.15,1290.45, these and literally this this amazing place that at this at this world one are you say what is what are the manufacturers who are you together in that in that small spot in michigan that are the most influential american manufactured one is the boss what is going on there
1293.27,1295.34, i think 
1295.4,1302.6, inordinate people that
1304.97,1313.49, and the miser architectonice in that atween to react to
1313.55,1319.49, pressure encouragement
1319.88,1325.25, i like that and my person
1325.25,1328.55, the fractures feltham
1328.73,1331.01, fortunate
1331.1,1339.62, as much an impact noticeably issues but the nescia issues around work as well
1340.22,1345.68, you're actually i mean because i know that the manufacturers who and awful
1346.04,1354.2, tried to understand what how social hopes have changed or changing and becoming different different work
1354.23,1357.95, habits of recuperation
1358.07,1370.73, you have this sort of amazing polyglot of people that you deal with to day for generations in the workplace at yodeling with so you have it not about
1370.85,1376.85, luxury pride of what its many types of products feeling with many many kinds of people
1376.91,1382.79, lately and i think you know the key for industrial designer and architects alive
1382.82,1388.1, understanding contact understanding the context of the things to make
1392.33,1398.96, a designer often imagine that we can create a better world
1399.02,1403.88, redirect that change people's behavior
1403.88,1407.63, you know i heretofore created over time i think
1407.72,1429.74, is that he had decided to hand understand and were attaching the confections and recondite to some extent but i don't think that object necessarily a change our world i think it's understanding that designers bring to problems and help change our world
1429.77,1443.48, so as we look at the lovely actings we decide we travertine accordant american understanding to the rest of the world for what work should be like
1443.63,1446.42, thundered
1448.82,1452.63, inconstancy
1452.78,1459.77, small and smaller faces all round the world people were in a closer potentate
1459.8,1465.95, londonomania into those words spaces and the more environment
1466.34,1470.36, really pomanders and first
1470.63,1476.15, well that is to be something new for our american manufacturers because we were
1476.42,1482.57, putting them out there and this is the greatest element into it and now you're looking at me
1483.02,1486.23, and local communities and local culture
1486.47,1493.79, with shotover different direction as a manufacturer because it's more more complex for you is designed
1494.12,1496.25, one side ospital
1496.88,1512.27, but interesting too well and that's that's the point i was trying to make her okay so ill what we who we do this i love to talk about the belt line with bill say but
1512.63,1516.95, i do that i'd like to ask 
1518.96,1522.77, the perpetrator of the great life green
1523.34,1529.16, of the belt line to explain that other
1529.34,1541.73, i i made a desert about the concept the idea of winicapora to a city like a land of because i think we should talk about this place but
1543.8,1547.82, the folks
1548.3,1550.1, yes
1550.61,1556.19, well i was at school at georgetown degree between our secure and city planning
1556.7,1560.12, i was interested in and had been studying how
1560.15,1563.51, instructresses influences are development
1563.69,1565.55, without parts
1565.55,1569.21, i credited
1570.38,1574.43, thwaite created a different kind of urban growth pattern
1574.46,1577.73, teresita accomplishes
1577.85,1581.51, filiation of these central city are
1582.71,1584.3, i take
1584.33,1588.8, teresa
1588.92,1590.78, there
1591.32,1600.71, recognizing a lot of faces entertainer you go but this unique when you start to trace a line of their sister
1600.71,1602.54, to
1603.83,1606.95, that is opportunity for the men
1610.43,1615.89, the origin of inaction 
1618.29,1620.24, and politics
1620.51,1623.36, i am
1626.99,1630.5, what happened was i was work for our itinerant and
1631.25,1637.76, unobserved of them happen to be on the monometallist rial
1641.84,1646.19, the intensity and we were talking with my forest in what he did you
1646.31,1652.01, partagas this old man and railroad or death was something else 
1652.19,1654.08, we 
1654.62,1660.74, about the idea was to castonia not tottering allumettes and massing
1660.95,1668.45, response from catherine of the city council represented as an tessalit started to picture
1668.75,1671.51, an important
1671.51,1673.94, i m
1674.18,1676.82, he was receptive
1676.82,1679.46, monsoreau
1679.52,1686.6, the athens for the next three years he went out to mediocre the city
1686.75,1694.82, the people of the city who saw a brighter future wearisome thing for himself he bought in idea and transformed into
1697.61,1699.32, people
1699.71,1704.42, the sabbath rest evocation aboard
1709.13,1714.35, i come along with the project and the political leaders wanted to do something different the life
1714.56,1722.6, eternities of the public or comes up at with their visions intestate believed there this is where
1722.66,1725.51, and just imagine
1725.6,1730.46, i think it important there is that we
1730.49,1738.38, we were not so of say a word great about an office now we've got all these opportunities and sit back and wait for them but it
1738.41,1741.8, that allusion there working
1741.83,1747.02, he at
1747.23,1750.26, his perceptive these kinds of things
1752.96,1754.79, we
1755.06,1765.77, he's got a lot of other cantata on him thank you so much i think i think what you point out though which is really interesting
1765.77,1780.05, that academic research and sort of presentation can really get the ball rolling in some of these issues and i'm not sure enough schools are doing that kind of work i mean you were in last program
1780.05,1784.28, zionists degrees being granted
1784.43,1788.96, that there's lots of room for this kind of expansion
1789.65,1792.05, at that day
1792.26,1797.09, the tabatiere parris projector of
1797.3,1802.19, to happen and david as an several cities
1802.25,1814.46, with students and several of the students are here to day some of them even wore at foreswear totoloque secrole that come with
1814.64,1818.87, eastertide
1818.87,1826.46, the opportunity but when he really started to get down to the next fall putting it together in front of one changes on one of which is
1826.7,1834.98, austerities and breakdown in logical dimension or in black at work for
1835.1,1838.43, i 
1838.43,1845.3, condition and george tawas crew crucial and the studies were critical and in getting this
1845.9,1851.72, the city and part of the process that he developed
1853.43,1857.63, at
1857.78,1865.04, the army of nurses measurement in everything abrogating
1865.16,1867.05, a great great
1867.38,1886.97, great information available so what i do is i love to ask bill say about this ballingall because he's also entertainment
1887.15,1888.68, i collect
1888.92,1894.41, and in your particular context may be as a developer
1894.62,1905.15, that kind of talk about what that means to some one who was done very well in atlanta bringing back historic buildings and turning them into something
1905.15,1926.27, a youthful that portend the saving as a result saying some of the old neighborhoods of a glad that which he seems to be very some person are left and many of them are and so what does what does this this bellinger inland
