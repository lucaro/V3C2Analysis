1.35,4.38, this video is about process floats
4.65,8.76, improvement focuses on improving processes and out comes
9.21,13.41, changing processes we aimed to make systems work better
13.53,16.14, ultimately to improve outcomes
16.5,19.47, an important improvement to is a freshet
19.83,23.25, also called a flow diagram of loma
24.27,30.0, essentially a picture that shows all key steps of a process in sequential order
31.23,40.59, why should we be process and create a frochot drawing a flood helps us defined and standardized key steps of a process
41.91,49.68, as to have a deeper understanding of a process and analyze the sequence of steps or actions that go into it
50.49,58.35, we had been able to more easily incorrect identify problems in the floor of health care from the patient perspective
59.19,66.03, mopping the floor of our work helps us highlight waste and allows us to understand wherein efficiency is lie
66.66,77.97, he then leads us to the critical step of generating and putting in place solutions to improve and stream lined walk processes which ultimately led to improvements in our comes
79.14,87.93, for charcoals a great communication to to help improvement is to elope a shared understanding of how a process is performed
88.32,97.11, drawing of low charge require some basic materials some not guards or sticking out a large piece of paper and a making pens
97.8,104.76, on and this video we will go over and example of a location patience visit to a clinic
104.88,109.29, first here is a five step process for drawing a low cut
110.13,111.27, step one
111.3,113.58, find the process to be mapped
113.94,117.36, it did at the top of the large paper
117.54,128.55, step to bring tom the activities that take place in the process sequence is not important at this point although thinking and sequence may help people remember all the steps
129.06,139.5, decide on the boundaries of your process where or when is a process start where owen does end what level of details should your flow charenton
140.04,144.81, you want this to be a high level low chart or do you want to get more granular
145.14,154.71, step three is to define as many key activities as you can in the process ride down each activity on a card or a sticking out
154.8,170.61, when all activities are included in step for arrange the sticky notes and sequence and draw arrows to show the flow of the process step five review the flow that with others in wadin the process
170.67,175.02, such a front line conditions supervisors and patience
175.02,179.13, see if they agree that the process is drawn accurately
179.25,189.15, added the frochard of needed now that we have looked at the five key steps and drawing a low card let us move on to some common symbols
189.18,191.28, used in drawing these charts
191.61,196.41, you choose to use these symbols are not is up to you and your improvement
197.19,201.33, a rectangle shows one step in the process
201.33,204.18, step is written inside the box
204.42,208.47, usually only one arrow leads out of the box
208.62,213.66, and added shows the direction of flow from one step or decision to another
213.93,218.76, a diamond did not decision points between two or more pots and your pichot
219.21,229.8, question is usually let in in the diamond more than one arrow leaps out of the diamond each arrow shows the direction the process takes for given answer to the question
230.28,234.75, often the answer yes and no or true and false
234.84,242.52, this symbol that resembles the letter d signifies a delay a waiting period when no activity is performed
243.15,252.99, a circle is a connector or link to another page or another flushed the same symbol on the other page or other flushed
253.11,255.63, indicates that the floe continue there
256.23,266.43, a barleymow imports or outwards or receiving or sending any type of data examples are receiving a labrador
266.55,270.18, sending an order for a prescription medication to the pharmacy
270.33,272.49, sending an emanation
273.12,278.31, a document is represented as in a tangle with a way webs
278.79,295.23, start an ensemble represented as over around rectangles usually containing the words start or and here are some tips for drawing process futures don't worry too much about drawing your flesh the right way or the wrong way
295.5,299.31, it is a way that helps people who are involved
299.31,301.17, understand the process
301.53,309.18, make sure to identify all keep people involved with the process and engage them in creating the float
309.48,321.48, this includes those who work in the process or are affected by it such as conditions supervisors and patience involved them by interviewing them before the session
321.63,329.34, drawing the float with them or by showing them the developing for chat between work sessions and obtaining the feedback
329.91,338.46, drawing a floor chart needs to be a hand on process by front line stakeholders do not assign a technical expert to draw the closet
338.64,342.39, who actually perform the process should do it
343.41,355.14, sometimes it is best to stop with the papuan and sticking notes coboea is available for drawing flute and a quite handy for drawing a neat final diagram
355.62,361.68, the messy initial stages of creating your float using ben on paper is just fine
362.37,372.63, now let us look at an example of a process frochot that was drawn as part of an effort to improve process turn around time at a pediatrics outpatient clinic
373.29,377.22, high level map of a difficult patient amicitias drawn here
377.49,383.91, we decided to color coates by whether they involved the funnels the nurse or the physician
384.42,388.47, a rosette the patient checking in at the frondes
388.71,395.25, the front desk the clerk enters the patients in the nation and to the electronic medical record or mayster
395.67,402.9, he must not from the ear that the patient has checked it gets the patient and a mother from the waiting room
403.23,406.14, tis them to the vital sign station
406.68,412.11, records the patients bilin and then walks with the family to the examination room
412.56,418.71, the medical transient season the emir that the patient is now in the exam
418.77,420.87, she abused the patients got
421.14,423.99, the example and see the patient
424.44,428.79, residences the exam to consult with the attending position
429.45,439.83, next the attending physician enters the example with the resident conforms key aspects of the history and exams for supervision requirements and then exit to
440.25,442.17, it completes the visit
442.41,445.62, the visit somebody from the computer in the exam rum
445.62,448.29, walks to the printer at the esitation
448.47,453.9, the rent comes back to the exam room and give the peninsula to the patient mother
454.41,462.03, the patient and mother then leave the room and go to the check out desk the clerk held them skate next appointment if one is needed
462.6,464.82, a mother than leave the clinic
465.48,467.28, the end of a process
467.43,472.47, portable of the flow that is an identifying areas for improvement
473.37,475.35, process danced
475.41,478.14, people doing the same work in different ways
479.04,481.74, shouted or out of sequence
482.43,486.42, the steps that do not add value to the outcome
486.54,490.89, the steps were arrows or delays occur frequently
491.28,497.1, the door did for a typical visit in the clinic is a hundred and twenty minutes or two wars on average
497.13,499.29, time spent in waiting
499.86,507.99, drawing the process map held the clinic staff understand that much of the time did not add value to the patient and a family
508.8,511.98, spent in waiting was essentially was
512.46,515.7, motioned to walking between the waiting room
515.88,519.27, but science station and example was waste
519.78,523.62, this information was obtained just from a high level process map
523.95,533.1, we can get even more granular like by mapping out steps in greater detail and adding and time spent at and between each step
534.18,539.1, stuff identified steps in the process which the fair could be improved first
539.4,544.53, the wide science could be measured in the example instead of a separate vitalisation
545.7,555.99, the resident would review the patient's chart in advance of the visit to using some waiting time in delay printers could be located close to or in the example
555.99,564.54, information could be sent electronically to the patient if the ear allows fred and the family alexandrine the visit summary
564.75,569.22, remember that quality improvement is a process not an event
570.03,575.04, process flow that helps a team map out steps and activities
575.22,580.59, identify those that result in waste and do not add value to patience
