0.81,2.7, as sara
3.75,8.64, i started this project till each other stories and
10.08,11.31, since the birth of
11.34,12.72, so child
13.32,14.61, my daughter
14.61,15.96, striking
16.32,17.88, but
18.57,20.16, at my first mother
20.94,23.97, being adopted and 
24.09,25.59, pulled out
25.89,28.29, little automata
28.83,31.2, and the arabs
31.92,33.87, details my search
35.13,38.1, for family for my first mother
43.08,44.37, at one
45.03,49.89, said this one and enjoy
50.52,68.97, early on sunday morning and march two thousand three the steel shank of an ice pick was crammed into my lower back a shadow of bed clutching my side only to discover there was no wound no blood my wife lord drove me to the hospital while i rise in pain
69.03,83.31, during my check and i began to feel very noted the lack of a frantic response was unnerving where was the game where are the doctors and nurses crowding over me jabbering in obscure medical jargon
83.37,89.76, why do they call this the emergency room what the hell was going on then i threw up
90.27,101.28, next child birth it is said the kidney stones produced the most intense pain it's the closest thing that i as a man will ever come to knowing what it's like to be in labor
102.15,114.54, or medication didn't work so they started me on some serious ivy pain killers shortly after the stabbing sensation began to fade away and doctor came in to ask me a battery of questions
114.57,121.83, honest gal from one to ten ten being the worst how at a rate my pain eleven
121.98,124.71, had i seen any blood in my hearin
124.83,131.16, yes some last night is there any medical history of kidney problems in my family
131.64,134.28, i don't know i replied i'm adopted
135.87,140.82, was every physical exam every medical checkup
140.97,148.05, even induce doctors visit the questions have always been met with the same blank i don't know
148.11,149.37, i adopted
149.97,155.37, i've always known i was adopted kelly my older sister was adopted to
155.49,166.5, are parents told us from a very early age that were special because they got to pick us we felt unique in a way that a child who dresses himself and mismatched socks feels unique
166.74,178.05, my sister has blond hair green eyes and dark complexion i have brown wavy hair brown eyes and pale freckled skin neither of us look like a parent
179.28,188.25, i went to a catholic grade school were kids in our classes had four siblings on either side of them while looked alike i didn't look like anybody else
188.82,191.28, this is a hole in my life
191.28,197.31, it's a feeling i'm sure the estimated six million other adopted americans can relate to
197.61,202.74, the exact number of total adopted people currently in the u s is unknown
203.22,220.02, because there's no federal law that governs adoptions each individual state handles adoption differently the last time reliable statistics were gathered was back in nineteen seventy five maybe there are more than six million maybe there are less
220.32,244.44, from a report on the national adoption information clearing house website states quote in nearly all states adoption records are sealed and withheld from public inspection after the adoption is finalized most days therefore have procedures by which parties to an adoption may obtain nonentity ing information from an adoption record unquote
244.77,256.59, missouri were both my sister and i were born and where our adoptions were finalized does have a couple of procedures in place that gives a searching adopt like me a few options
256.71,260.25, the first is a mutual consent registry
260.31,272.91, this only works if both parties know about their registry register and give consent i signed up eight years ago when a periodic updates of my current address but it never helped
273.96,280.77, who works at the registry told me they don't even keep official statistics on how many reunions they facilitate
280.8,284.7, she thought it might be one a mother may be even to
285.63,320.94, from nineteen eighty eight to nineteen ninety seven missouri averaged two thousand three hundred adoptions a year the second option is for an adult adopted to obtain either assign notarized consent form or a decorticated for both of their adoptive parents depending whether they are alive or deceased then the adopting must send it to the county court the finalized the adoption just to start an adoption search the third party search agent the adopted has to pay for the search agent out of pocket and there's no guarantee of success
321.6,326.88, i adult and i still need to note for my mother to learn where i came from
327.33,329.73, there is a third option
329.79,340.32, to approach every state county city agency and private institution involved in the adoption and request copies of any scrap of information related to the adoption
340.41,352.26, just like there's no federal law creating uniformity among states regarding adoption there's also no state law creating uniformity between government agencies and private institutions
352.38,360.93, this means that one place may include a first name and blank out the last name where another may blackout the first name and include the last name
361.2,368.13, so there are roughly six million people who may not know whom they look like or where they came from
368.25,378.03, they don't know if they have an increased likelihood for breast cancer or once they retire whether or not there at an increased risk for the mental decline of all his
378.06,384.06, we all grow up on aware of the potential biological hazards lurking in our genetic histories
384.15,394.98, we are all ignorant of where we get our eyes are smiles or our ability to deliver a killer slam dunk my doctor was un phase by my lack of medical history
395.25,401.58, he was more interested in analyzing a treatment plan for the three decently sized kidney stones making their way through my body
402.3,417.15, i decided to have the nastiest stoner movement take my chances with the other two smaller ones the medical staff managed my pain and kept the ice picks at bayville waited for my calcilate exorcism
417.42,425.04, after the sons evacuation they analyze it and prescribed a preventative diet so this sort of thing wouldn't happen again
425.94,431.22, one night in the hospital i wandered out loud to lure while this was happening to me
432.27,435.72, as a teenager i suffered with him rosanna
436.53,440.4, i told her i was sick of having these surprise medical emergencies
440.79,450.87, why don't you start searching for your birth parents again my wife suggested once you find a biological parents may be will be able to answer your questions
450.96,454.44, plus it will be helpful when we start trying to get pregnant
454.47,459.24, after returning from the hospital i dug up my search file
459.48,467.91, my search for my biological parents began in earnest in nineteen ninety six but it really began three years before that
468.3,475.65, i was home for christmas in nineteen ninety three when kelly showed me a stack of paper she had received from the state of missouri
476.13,482.46, it was the non identifying social history of her biological mother typed up by some social worker
483.51,488.88, i was amazed at the detail it was at once abstract and concrete
488.91,507.54, and keep places were blank spaces were names of people used to be it was a sort of declassified personal history document it could have been the construction of a writer's fancy but this woman was real she was out there somewhere she gave birth to my sister
508.02,518.67, kelly's birth mother was very social and studied to become a nurse kelly a very popular girl in high school was at the time a few credit shy of her nursing degree
519.15,525.48, having gotten this far my sister was satisfied with what she knew i didn't want to go any farther
525.93,530.67, she shared her investigative secrets with me so that i might start my own search
530.82,534.06, it was three years before i was ready
534.63,540.24, before i sent up my first request litter i already had a couple of scraps into it my origin and my baby book
541.56,546.45, there was a baby form a pamphlet with the name baby jonathan written on it
546.9,549.66, my name is to be jonathan
550.05,556.14, there were the notes my father took about my birth mother during the placement meeting just before i was handed over
557.22,564.45, pampanga drama music physical characteristics heredity
564.75,569.91, a swedish giant german french and english basically a year out
569.91,573.69, for most popular iowa
574.53,586.05, for years whenever i would drive through iowa i would stop at random town colibri and look at your books from the time of my birth mother would have gone to school
586.38,590.73, i study the hands in the faces looking for any familiarity
591.54,593.25, it was hopeless
593.31,600.39, eventually i had all the information about my adoption that my sister had about her and more
600.78,610.2, i had the same kind of blank out document that told about hobbies and interests but no names are places my birth parents identities were still a mystery
611.01,617.94, after eighteen months of solid tective work i abandoned my search i was emotionally drained
619.29,627.12, as the years passed i pull out the file now and then and go through it each time i reach the same conclusion that it was hopeless
628.08,633.18, about a month after my kidney operation i was discussing my renewed search with my father
633.9,636.75, always a pragmatist he attempted to console me
637.02,643.44, you need to prepare yourself for the possibility that they don't want to have anything to do with you i do ever think about that
644.13,646.98, yes of course i had thought about that
647.76,650.55, i had him on the phone i shared my findings with him
650.91,661.62, counting the blank spaces i knew my birth mother's first name was four letters long she marched in the rolls board she was according to his notes from iowa
661.92,663.12, iowa
663.51,679.68, i was from iowa not you are you sure i asked it was right there in his handwriting absolutely i kept a journal back then and i remember specifically riding down that she was from iowa i even had a way to get in contact with the mother's family at the time
680.28,684.39, all these years i have been looking in the wrong state
685.71,691.44, i knew from the copy of my adoption to create that my name before i was adopted was jonathan emerson
691.86,695.13, someone had neglected the blank out my name
695.91,699.72, the first name matched the name of my baby formula pamphlet
700.2,705.99, looking for emerson's in nineteen ninety six and every phone book and iowa seemed an impossible task
706.65,711.48, now i knew she wasn't for my way and now i had the internet
712.05,717.15, another suggestion from laura proved to be the golden key unlocked all the doors
717.54,722.94, why don't you investigate the roles ball that's a pretty significant piece of information
723.93,734.55, she was right i contacted the tournament of rose's prade office and pass a dankali oria i had them face me a copy of the prey program from the year my birth mother would have marched in it
734.97,739.41, only three universities march that year and none of them were iowa
740.07,743.4, soon all the pieces began to fall into place
743.4,748.29, what once seemed interesting but unhelpful was now very important
748.56,752.67, i started with the first university in called the school library
753.12,759.15, was there a woman on the marching squad with the last named of emerson and a first name for letters long
759.21,764.79, i asked him to check the year books and school newspapers from the year of the school marched in the rose ballad
765.48,769.68, later in the afternoon i received a call back from the librarian
769.86,775.05, there was a woman whose first name was for letters long and whose last name was emerson
775.62,780.36, that i want them to email me a picture of the marching squad from the college year book
780.48,785.37, within minutes i had grayskin image of my birth mother
786.0,788.22, i know it now it's her
788.25,791.61, at the time i had to be absolutely certain
792.45,796.68, the name of the drama club matched the description from my social history
796.92,802.95, on directory listings from her home town machination i had about her father's occupation
803.34,813.72, the age a number of siblings matched i even checked the nineteen thirty cents is to verify the occupation of my birth mothers paternal grandfather
814.23,815.85, everything checked up
816.18,821.55, still more phone calls and our net research on earth an obituary for her father
821.55,823.05, grandfather
823.11,826.05, he died of cancer in nineteen eighty seven
826.23,830.04, i now had her married name and new city of residence
830.22,833.76, a simple internet serge told me her address and forever
834.0,838.17, i was tended away from speaking to the woman who brought me into this world
839.4,853.83, my birth mother whose name is just four letters long travel across the country to live the final months of her pregnancy and seclusion at the willows maternity sanitarium at twenty nine twenty nine main street in kansas city missouri
854.19,857.76, it was the same place my parents went to pick me up
857.76,860.49, giving their daughter a little brother to play with
860.58,867.36, before the pill before rove wade middle class on which mothers had few options
867.93,871.74, keep a child who was conceived out of wedlock was a social taboo
872.1,877.53, the mother would be thought of a selfish the child would certainly be derided as a bastard
878.37,881.55, man would marry a woman so deeply scarred
882.3,883.59, then
884.67,889.83, the young woman who stayed at the willows were to have no contact with the outside world
890.58,894.42, i was encouraged to use a made up name to protect her privacy
894.54,899.1, exchange of personal information between the young women was discouraged
899.52,905.34, the will is hospital sat atop a hill at the end of a very long flight of stairs
905.91,907.8, no visitors were allowed
908.85,915.3, i read just about every property deep legal document business record and newspaper article on the willows
915.57,922.65, the kansas city public library keeps a vertical file three inches thick on the willows because so many people inquire about it
924.69,929.7, it was a private institution started by edwin in cohort in 
930.15,939.75, and its years of operation pigworth edmund anchors daughter in law estimated that twenty five thousand women had stated the wolves
940.59,943.65, in nineteen sixty nine the willows closed
943.74,952.53, it was eventually raised and if you believe the newspaper accounts all of the facilities records were piled up in the back yard and burned
953.7,966.15, so if each of the twenty five thousand women had a file of say fifty pieces of paper that would add up to one million two hundred fifty thousand pieces of paper
966.6,974.7, put all that paper into boxes and you get a wall of boxes ten feet tall two feet deep and eighteen feet long
974.91,977.97, that would have been one hell of a fire
978.36,990.12, i contacted the kansas city fire museum who checked the kansas city fire departments hand written ledgers for a six month period around the closure of the willows there is no record of any fire
990.33,994.32, the articles that mentioned the fire included no eyewitness accounts
994.38,997.05, no fire department officials are quoted
997.44,1003.02, apparently someone was very interested in keeping the identities of these young women a secret
1003.38,1012.29, there's a rumor going around among willows adopted that the records are stored in a limestone cave under the world of fundament park
1013.73,1016.94, i understood the seriousness of what i was about to do
1017.12,1027.26, my birth mother indicated in her social history that nobody knew about her pregnancy her brothers and sisters were told she was off working for the government and a summer jobs program
1028.61,1036.83, was my father right did she not want to be found i had come this far i had to see it through
1037.7,1043.31, at such a moment is turning point of my life i had to proceed with caution
1043.82,1050.54, i read books so edvice and learn what others had done to achieve successful reunions
1051.11,1059.39, i contacted sarah and intermediate third party and requested that she berthier herself contact my birth mother
1059.45,1063.41, sir had made hundreds of these types of calls before
1063.44,1069.05, she is a search agent who facilitates reunions of adopted children and their birth parents
1069.23,1075.41, on sunday september seventh two thousand three i received coomara
1075.47,1078.5, she had called the honored given her
1078.59,1084.44, she asked to speak to my birth mother by name and told her was regarding a very personal matter
1085.46,1087.2, what's this about
1088.19,1092.99, sara explained that it was about the birth of a boy and gave her the day i was born
1094.82,1096.71, how did you find me
1097.04,1102.86, your son found you said sir he is very smart and determined he pieced it together
1103.25,1108.92, no i was supposed to find out nobody knows not my children not even my husband
1109.97,1111.89, she was clearly stunned
1111.89,1117.68, my birth mother told sarah that she thought about me all the time especially on my birthday
1118.37,1133.58, sarah recounted their conversation to me she described how she explained to my birth mother that promises of anonymity may have been made to her but nobody could have foreseen the advent of the internet making the search for birth parents a lot easier
1134.99,1141.32, as for my instructions sir requested that she share any medical information that might be useful
1141.44,1149.42, no nothing really i'm pretty healthy my mother has all emerson my father died fifteen years ago from kidney cancer
1150.77,1154.49, sarah asked her if she was interested in reuniting with me
1155.75,1157.13, i can't
1158.24,1161.6, felt like i had been punished in the stomach
1163.91,1166.31, and i discussed my options
1166.73,1172.34, my birth mother had indicated that she was a private person and wanted her privacy respected
1173.3,1187.1, flowers could be sent anonymously on my birthday perhaps sarah could act as a go between for correspondence a married woman getting a letter from another woman is less suspicious than getting one from an anonymous source
1188.51,1191.87, you have my one number sir to my birth mother
1191.9,1195.83, if anything changes feel free to give me a call
1197.54,1199.88, later sarah's poring
1200.09,1201.65, it was my birth mother
1202.46,1204.35, i just can't
1207.83,1210.77, who knows what she was going through that point in her life
1212.03,1215.18, who was he to come barging in and turn it upside down
1215.96,1220.01, at the time i decided not to attempt any further contact
1220.1,1221.48, i was crushed
1222.02,1224.39, i couldn't hear any more
1225.47,1229.79, sobbing a ham the former to laura finished the call
1231.02,1238.16, two weeks later i wrote my birth mother a letter and included some pictures the senate through sarah the intermediary
1239.15,1243.47, it came back opened with a handwritten note tied around it
1243.71,1247.61, dear sarah i want to be left alone
1247.76,1250.49, i want my privacy respected
1250.52,1253.43, i want no further contact
1253.43,1256.43, i hope i have made myself perfectly clear
1258.2,1259.7, crystal clear
1260.54,1265.52, it took me seven years to prepare myself for that eventful september day
1266.18,1274.67, i could do was give my birth mother seven years to live with the knowledge that i was alive that i loved her and that i wanted her as a part of my life
1275.96,1278.0, she is in pain
1278.57,1284.12, she said that she can't not that she won't there's a big difference
1284.12,1297.5, what he needs is some one to talk to some one to confide in it sounds like she doesn't have any one to share her motions with these were some of the responses i got from first mother's reunited
1297.83,1307.07, an internet base support group i stumbled across late one night in a search for answers each first mother relinquished a child to adoption
1307.34,1312.26, now they are turning to each other to deal with the emotions associated with their experience
1312.41,1319.82, on their website they posted an open letter to all adopts and welcome emails from those meaning advice
1320.0,1324.8, i sent him an email detailing my search and subsequent rejection
1325.28,1327.92, support was overwhelming
1328.1,1335.72, stay up until three a m some night reading and answering emails from these women the death can never be repaid
1336.38,1339.98, their depth of understanding has given me new insight
1341.09,1346.07, they prefer the term first mother because they feel it more accurately described them
1346.82,1353.03, it leaves open the possibility for reunion and the development of a continuing relationship
1353.75,1360.05, they reason that if a mother can love more than one child then surely a child can love more than one mother
1363.56,1370.79, if i couldn't talk to my own first mother for whatever reasons and talking with these women with the next best thing
1371.15,1377.27, what's wrong with me why don't you want to meet me isn't she curious about the man that i become
1378.11,1384.5, skilfully patiently the answered all the questions and i'm sure i asked more than once
1384.53,1388.88, here it is one year after sarah's phone call
1389.12,1391.88, my first mother is now a grandmother
1392.03,1397.73, laura and i have a son we plan on having another child and we may even adopt
1398.24,1410.12, for the first time in my life there's somebody who looks like me a tiny biological mirror his thumbs band at a complete right angle at the first joint of like mine
1410.63,1414.17, my father in law tells me that he smiles just like me
1415.88,1420.08, one day i hope to look into my first mother's eyes and search of answers
1421.04,1423.23, i want her to tell me her story
1423.74,1428.15, when i asked her why i want to hear her say because
1429.92,1435.32, it is very difficult for me to seek acceptance from such an important stranger and not get it
1436.07,1440.15, we may both go to our graves having never uttered a word to each other
1441.14,1443.63, i suppose i can live with that
