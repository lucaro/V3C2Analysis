102.03,110.46, to get as far as possible from these because i was not that have been orsino i looked on the map and you never was a first
111.33,113.04, so in geneva
113.07,116.25, i actually continued to critical
116.4,120.66, for my living i was quite lucky i had

139.8,157.26, marette atmosphere was very very dry and quite cold into near and i started to realize that the only way i could work was if i work at night and slept in a day as i had to share the is for the girls
159.06,178.65, and before the girls are all religious jewish girls it was strictly collar so i began to work at night because i felt either in talking and insoluble or i can work a colobus and after half effetto may be this is not so good for my health
179.13,191.97, by chance met a young woman who sat in a im being treated anteroches or must recover and his wonderful institution where they teach
193.98,196.41, it may be that something for you
196.59,199.05, i went there in a well like that
199.2,204.33, my mother to influence my father to allow me to stay there
204.66,216.84, tartars and a ready always made things i made cocheforet and gloves and stones and tin and then they have the collection there to a love making things
217.14,220.26, seeming animation makes into something life
220.44,222.69, he gave me confidence was i realized
222.84,234.03, so when i worked his patients very soon i got to work with patience that may be being free and imaginative and open without accent of real knowledge
234.24,251.88, in intuition work but it will this is still from the first period of figurative work the said well it is called embrace very office after my diploma already have made my husband
252.12,263.52, manliness is a fullan medicined we have to live in london which suited me okay it was a long way away from these

272.46,274.14, mention
274.17,284.13, much more attractive than working in graphic and at sallee in front of it think plate or clapper paper and in have the
284.13,303.27, inspiration and as stated and collecting things out it was clavering in play and soon enough had some exhibitions he had children then and the topic was very often pregnancy love couples actually findlater often a work like that that i am portraying what i hadn't cost
303.3,309.6, when i wanted to a child i may this pregnant or so important
310.2,354.45, this piece incantation which was again in no marriage and i did a lot of pieces to do with relationships i started it was an obsession into flexibility because these guys you see till a touch to each other whether they like so i started to make the peace which was called transfigurement these figures have personality of their own but they really work well when there together and when they do things together and was very interested to try and see that there's not one clear dominance idolisation decanters visiter but they can also do tender things
354.78,366.42, especially because now i was married and had children and i felt there was may be the danger of being starting counting a particular role that you can't get out of so
366.42,368.31, for me this was always
368.7,436.32, important being able to voice as these actualities me recognition for had an exhibition that the scenes whether feature this so here you have the mother which in my view is always contretems flexible character this one also stand on her back or on her head so as in the life you can see that women have to be able to do anything so the father gets supported and the baby get supported by the most vanderhovens about intenshuns forever claverton that when i may be intuitive presentable he wore i made a very large ordination did up in carts and gardens don't kiss could actually carry it and they could sit the crow under the bed sat on the other

655.02,660.84, on the standing more about any and that understanding more about
660.96,676.38, in a thing atavistic and i did continue working work less and my besought to patmore overshoot
676.59,683.22, the satinwood to me started on committing a handed in something meaningful where i was
684.6,693.03, interacting with other people as i like tactile interaction like touching a like feeling in
693.54,695.37, around
695.82,697.56, to a little to
697.71,700.68, he people or myself
700.83,706.23, masaniello anything from whom you have the same
706.5,708.15, how 
708.45,713.13, elevation first of all into dominates in
713.13,717.84, in some denominations for me because i detest
717.99,720.39, standing of an energy that 
720.69,727.38, only she considered to really develop definite of myself with a hopeful
727.86,730.17, it quite a norfolk
731.13,738.27, and because you have to start it at allenham but i could hear of beata
738.42,749.25, feinting to turin and something on the right hand as if straining and could be in
749.31,755.1, it was a relation i would not be interested with his musical
755.43,797.22, it sheered
797.31,835.95, it now i just looking at the serious reticent rather quiet and only showed once in public before leaving for london i called admissions of ourselves over pieces which showed more some problems in life public and private problems as for example here this is
836.4,839.01, peace about the man a pause
840.15,855.06, something they all faced honor were really we still feel beautiful like you will have seen in the mirror of the woman still feels like she was when she was young but she has to face the fact that things
855.54,857.58, not quite the same
857.82,859.62, grass is greener
860.31,871.53, i also called on brick or my rainbow without i realized said the well is very much what we believe it to be a boy wanted to be not always so reality he just see
871.95,878.04, this hand which is my hand reaching up for this ominous apple which is a true
878.82,882.66, this is a tree of life it was actually called the tree of life
883.23,900.0, i always felt that it was good that adam had a bite of his apple that gave him a knowledge of good and evil and all the bits in between but on the niche is also good huge eye of his lying the eye of god so
900.0,902.52, these lashes from her
903.0,909.87, they are also a flame that fayaway back into paradise the peace
911.1,913.68, entirely made of short the path
914.79,917.67, i felt that i was actually problematic
919.62,921.78, try and look like the
922.65,936.15, then there it has the hickories her little poem i think this piece was called heroes or former heroes and it is really about the forgather
936.3,946.56, naturally of her being on a stage and you can see reflection this is hopeless
946.68,993.9, all his laurels being nicely dried up with indian his fate is the same as everybody else we were in middle of a war against middle east with all these efforts which are sold as the huge waste opposes a waste pipe and it aside me with it another topic i could do nothing about he also started combining materials now i started combining wood with bronze other things a stone and i laughed the diorama have come from chieveley very much aware of the ring and sang of things of the hollow and the full this piece again is not always noises
994.98,996.42, can be
996.51,997.77, he
998.04,1002.09, but i think this is really where it starts
1002.57,1005.57, startled
1007.46,1017.18, but the days a person that is quite noted as suppose like this most artistry of to biographical little to other people stuff
1023.78,1030.14, these figures can go their own way so you feel like kind of belong
1030.17,1057.23, then they have to keep teaching how to the lone for the raided want to after the study of hatteras also you know just more returned to myself i justitiae than other matronise i was calling the hand of fate this is simply made interrogation cesaire trap inside this hand

1068.39,1071.93, my dream so this is me
1072.65,1074.69, suppose hugging myself
1074.75,1076.28, a little worse
1076.46,1094.64, it was a sort of time or of reflection i like very much that my old could be touched and actually in some of the exhibitions i required that a peace harwich didn't go down so well vainglory so this lady can be like this
1094.88,1099.08, outward or looking down at the earth
1100.22,1112.85, the open perhaps more well able that this piece is a beginning of the series which i call strength and loneliness for one added a man which is a bit unusual for me
1113.3,1115.82, the man was again probably me
1117.44,1125.63, and you can see that he's not really touching his trust he will i suppose is also came out from particularize you
1125.78,1128.57, strength doesn't come from moral
1129.56,1134.72, and he somehow able to hold up this wall that could crush him
1135.11,1148.49, but he has pointed decided to come to lugano yeah but i decided to come to lagarto thousands and two i had several other phases but when i came here there was to
1148.97,1151.76, a very marked by new work
