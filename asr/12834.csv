0.03,17.07, he one
33.69,55.14, dark energy is part of the fabric of space itself and it turns out that when its created by the universe there is an offset in how the universe is shaped and how the universe is expanding so unfortunately you don't get anything for free and so it's pretty much impossible to undo at least as humanity the effects of dark energy
55.29,64.17, and it's effectively impossible to harvest it in any way shape or form a sort of a giant sink that really there's not much we can do with
71.58,80.04, so because dark energy is part of the fabric of space as the universe speeds up over time more spaces made
80.04,111.63, more adams and more dark energy or more dark matter are not made and that means that the fraction of the universe is going to change over time right now seventy three per cent dark energy but if we wait another ten or fifteen billion years than ninety five per cent of the universe will be dark energy because the universe is expanded so much and so yes the balance of the universe changes over time because adams a dark matter get diluted by the expansion of space and dark energy doesn't
118.62,151.35, gravity is not completely understood what we know is that anything that has master energy has gravity and we suspect there's some particle which is thrown around between objects which causes the force and so really gravity is stored in everything there is but unfortunately the theory of how gravity fits in with quantum field theory which is the other three forces of nature that is a big outstanding problem for physics that is yet to be resolved
158.4,182.82, so neptune a planet much bigger than the earth is made out of gas now its year is a little bit longer than a hundred and sixty years for it to go around the earth so that's like a year but it rotates her equity sixteen hours in six minutes have takes to turn on its axis so it's day is about sixteen hours in six minutes on like the twenty four hour day that we have here on earth
189.78,198.6, the end of the universe is something that if the universe were eventually to collapse on to itself it had the opposite
198.6,206.04, the big bag that can give by talked about then that would be the end of the universe but the end of the universe would be in the time
206.07,222.39, ah then you know some place and so it pears that's not what the universe is doing and so really there is no end of the universe there's no place in the universe that you could go that has an edge and since time goes on forever it without in that direction as well it appears
229.59,264.66, in the very very distant future will say hundreds of trillions of years in the future it turns out that every star in our galaxy will have burned its fuel and will have died and so there will be literally no heat left in the universe every part of the universe will be cooling down to absolute zero and that will make it impossible for life to exist into the distant future instead the universe will just sort of fizzle out and so it's a very bleak end for the for the universe
271.71,354.51, so as the sun as its nuclear furnace which is converting hydrogen into helium is actually heating up and so the sun is getting hotter and hotter over time and so the earth turns out has been compensating for this by absorbing more and more carbon dioxide and so we've been sort of used the earth use global warming to keep itself warm early on and not carbonade is slowly getting incorporated in rocks and things over time so as the earth gets hotter probably about eight hundred million years from now the earth will be extraordinarily hot because almost all the so too despite what humans are doing now will be out of the atmosphere in terms of the sun coming towards us now it turns out that the earth is just minutely moving away from the sun but its almost imperceptible and that's caused by title forces the sun affects the tides on the earth moon around and those things and up taking a dragging energy out of the earth orbit to overtime we go a little bit further away from the sun that thing said as the sun he's up it gets a little bigger and so in some sense the surface coolie closer to us
360.78,394.29, so when we measured the fact that the universe was accelerating that was a measurement that we made using these exploding stars superno but the theory behind why the universe might be accelerating gates all the way back to einstein and a person named george lamar who was a belgian monk and so those people were interested in the energy that makes gravity push rather than pull and they developed that theory really in the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties
401.4,432.87, well people travel to mars in our lifetime that is an interesting question it is certainly possible the question is how much it costs it's rather remarkable that when i was five man last went to the moon since the last forty years of my life we haven't been to the moon and the reason why is it really really expensive so i really think it's going to depend on you know how much people are willing to spend so i don't know if it's going to happen or not
440.28,473.49, time travel is possible but only in one direction that is if i want to move forward and time relative to some one else i just need to travel really really quickly and so if i go to alastor really really quickly and come back eight point six years will have elapsed here on earth were only second swoops for me and in that way i can travel forward in time but there is no way that we know of to go backwards in time
481.62,541.35, a nobel prize winner my salary didn't suddenly go up for it turns out i a scientist that i am paid very very well i'm not a millionaire but i'm not poor either i have a very good salary and i frankly i make more money than i want to spend so actually give away a lot of my money every year for that reason the nobel prize itself was worth ten million swedish crown which was about one point four million dollars australian now i got a quarter of that and again because i didn't feel i really wanted to go out and buy myself a merarite what some one else do that i donated that money and i donated it to help some school programs for education donated to help build a building for science in washington d c knowing that i a dual citizen and then a lot of the money i spent just to bring the entire team to a stockholm and to celebrate our nobel prize
548.7,605.94, so right now we are as astronomers looking all over the sky for planets it is my hope with the next generation of optical telescopes one which australia part of called the giant magellan telescope that we will be able to potentially see the signs of life during my lifetime by looking at a planet when it passes in front of its star and that means the light will shine through its atmosphere now as you know here on earth we put all sorts of stuff into our atmosphere like a wet we put in things that rooshians and things and those have very specific fingerprints which we can see and other types of life don't make a dark naturally created so i think if there is a lot of a life out there we will see potentially signs of it in the next twenty or thirty years with the next generation of telescopes
605.94,613.11, it all depends on how much of the how what the how much of it there is out there and that i guess one of the reasons to look
619.92,686.04, if an object is moving towards the speed of light and you have for example a torch let's think of it from two perspectives imagine i'm on that airplane now turns out nothing can travel the speed of light it can only approach the speed of light but a fundamental part of einstein's theory of special relativity that's the one that gave us he equals ensured is that the speed of light is the same no matter what you're doing no matter how fast you're going so if you shine your torch the light will go away from you at the speed of light what happens if i'm looking at you from you know in the front of that light is shineth it comes at you at the speed of light because again every one sees the speed of life by the same but because your moving so quickly you're shrinking the photons you compressing them and that makes the potins had higher energy and so it might be if you're going fast enough you are torch will become a gambler torch rather than just a light torch
686.07,704.49, the other hand he shine the torch backwards away from the direction of motion than if you're looking at that port from behind the light will be so stretched that in rather than being a normal torch it will be a radio wave towards because radio waves have much longer wavelength
711.39,726.72, i travel the speed of white it turns out you cannot have any mass soon as you have as it is impossible to travel the speed of light and so masses particles of which the photon is one they can travel the speed of light nothing else can
