8.07,29.55, national child nutrition program is designed to standardize child growth screening protocols to ensure that children are growing to their full potential and important part of this process is anthropometric letterman which refers to the way that children are measured and includes measurements like height and wait
30.0,35.52, this idea will demonstrate proper procedures for measuring head circumference of a child
36.0,42.78, there are ten assessment of a child's growth provides an important guide to a child's health development
42.87,48.27, in status and response to treatment or nutrition interventions
48.81,53.07, head circumference is a fundamental measurement for tracking a child's growth
53.4,57.72, the brain develops most rapidly in the first five years of life
58.26,65.85, taking a child's head circumference is an important way to ensure brain growth and development is normal
67.05,68.7, measurement techniques
69.12,74.22, the tools you need to measure head circumference include head circumference tape
75.78,77.97, the head circumference growth that
78.54,89.79, to measure the head circumference of infants and children up to five years of age you will need a head circumference measurement tape a cloth measuring tape is not appropriate
90.3,94.74, it is very important to take this measurement quickly and accurately
94.89,97.2, while using the appropriate tools
98.37,108.3, the person measuring the child must first wash their hands and sure the heads are composed tape is sanitized to avoid the spread of illness
108.72,120.33, place the tape around the child's head the head circumference table should be placed above the ears and midway between the eyebrow and the hair line to the bump at the back of the head
120.66,122.22, he
123.33,131.61, however this is a guide and not all children have the same head shape a gesture approach as needed
131.64,136.83, keep in mind that your aim is always to measure the largest circumference possible
137.61,139.71, some
139.98,148.38, head circumference tape firmly around the child's head so that the hair is compressed and there is not space between the table and the child's head
148.8,156.03, however be sure not to pull the tape so tightly that the child's skin boulders around the measurement tape
156.84,170.28, read the measurement between the arrows in the window of the head circumference tape and called the number out loud the measurements should be taken to the nearest millimeter and recorded to the first vessel
170.76,171.78, remember
172.14,190.41, always look for bends or kinks in the head circumference tape before every use a bent head circumference table will not provide accurate results and should be replaced sanitized the head circumference tape before use between children and after use
191.28,197.73, you can always repeat the procedure to verify accuracy especially if the child was moving
198.3,203.31, the tape should be pulled firmly tight around the widest part of the child's head
203.91,230.82, documentation a single measurement does not reflect the rate of growth in order to establish a child growth tends the child measurements must be routinely made and plodded on a growth that measurements should be immediately recorded into the nutrition screening system the nutrition screening system form should be completed within the same day as the child's measurements
230.82,248.64, in order to complete the nutrition screening system action plan growth charts must be consistently plotted and interpreted this measurement must be recorded in the child's record in the nutrition screening system database and must include the date
248.73,250.92, of the measure
250.92,256.02, and should also be patted on the head circumference for age growth there
256.77,264.12, there is one growth chart that uses a child's head or conference to determine if they are meeting developmental targets
264.3,289.68, the head circumference for age chart measures the child's head circumference according to their chronological age each child should have their own set of growth charts that track their overall progress refer to these charts in determining the child over all health status watch the growth chartrain ing video to learn more about proper growth sharp plotting and chart interpretation
289.77,297.45, you may also review the child nutrition training manuals or corresponding child nutrition training modules
298.44,318.36, king children's growth consistently and accurately is one of the best preventative methods for combating malnutrition early in a child's life this is just one of five critical indicators of a child growth and development please review holds other child nutrition training videos
