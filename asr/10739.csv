0.51,15.63, he 
19.65,33.57, okay so much identified partenheimer to beat
33.84,36.54, it been one of the
37.26,41.28, members of the enjoyment
41.76,47.82, that greensward of the company but
48.87,50.79, as well
51.27,58.38, diderot for the phone attired some years ago as i too
58.44,59.88, serious 
59.91,68.22, cornelis first one after asked manoeuver the but and there was a second spring to 
68.37,69.66, acting
69.66,75.72, cassiopeia one is needed for tolerated for getting
75.84,78.96, these music of war
80.79,85.14, at that time it was only the iron inordinate
85.56,88.68, the idea of agitators
88.77,90.12, at
90.18,91.47, music
91.77,97.38, that is not just a fraction of a serious or so
97.59,99.39, a dynamic
99.51,109.02, i with me we acted in so it has to combat some kind of logic as well so it's not only just 
109.8,112.62, but something that also has a retentive
112.89,116.73, if we could be parsonified to use her belief
117.0,118.11, because
120.33,123.24, the ion the epos
124.62,128.52, elias cristofer a lot of fiddling to
128.55,132.87, the kind of running for it which of the screen are for such
139.71,145.53, but as you see already here and the unessential by heart and lissomely not
145.65,149.97, into his every word and so i
150.18,154.26, my tentative lop a lottery that one to present here 
155.91,164.7, i always took great care to some mature that it's not any way specific to abort phone or to some stuff like that
164.85,169.32, that tortoise useful gently
169.65,179.07, the library as i came here and i caught his orations for getting things done just sending
179.43,182.19, the goal of the labor
182.31,188.91, from the first goal of oddities to make this music available to lots of people
189.21,196.56, a lot of people they are currently mother are several million dollars of the argentine of wheat phones
197.13,209.22, a quite amazing when the first verticale out and i i had a piece of music on this so nominative mean if there is a pedometer a hundred people on the contents of many of us
209.43,211.59, but no man be played with life
211.92,235.38, uncrippled and maybe ten of them are also performing at the same life and so on why is it not at such a big munity but with this identity on the phone suddenly had found on one week of my peace of utility thousand dollars or so because there were so many people are interested in it became quite a high and even now her
235.41,249.6, the inception apotheosizing the adding it think it has blondinette different community that is reached through this and so often beautifully was very important
249.84,254.13, as many of you know it's distribute ability
256.98,258.48, is quite difficult
258.66,265.65, many pieces are not even disagreeable between your own labor and your friends let because maybe the same external
265.83,269.94, as learning like that so we
270.18,275.79, we we didn't want to deal with it as riprobate so
276.0,281.13, a way to get out of this problem to how can you make a path distributable
282.66,294.93, he was a bitterness only the object assistant or available and we are well you have pity and this means the penobscot
295.47,302.04, the underone titterers help and you have to have to
302.22,304.2, paralysed
304.38,309.48, objects in the artillery or the like affections abilities in these
310.98,317.46, and because of license reasons we could not include include expression
317.73,320.76, that's all and given
321.69,324.78, they don't like each other so
325.5,330.3, another way to make the use of pet
330.3,341.49, seen as a patch including additional resources like a mad fiorimonde all our body of actions that you use into the same director that your own music lives
342.78,351.93, several composers who actually went like this day they go even to more extreme state paleontology usinara of pale
351.99,361.95, they put it on directory and then they start working and there to this every time they start a new composition which was to make sure that it will be unable longer time
362.34,364.5, have to be that extreme but
364.56,371.13, bundling abstractions into a retriever by copying it i might be a feasible approach
371.52,376.11, the deliberate desire except for this process
376.29,378.3, oglou
378.57,381.3, to just
381.45,383.94, over to your project directory
385.71,393.99, that's what i sometimes call understood which is terminated by a thinker
395.76,398.52, and
398.94,400.77, the opposite
401.22,404.22, gobernacion nessary
404.22,412.95, if you want some one else to write poetising this library you just get them your petition the library and i will just run it doesn't have to install anything
415.53,418.14, it's useful to
418.35,423.45, he was a declared message to decorate to make
423.45,427.65, your past stable under a shorter name with not the odds
427.86,429.9, objection
429.93,437.7, hesitates can also use the full artillery by tapping every object and with a gleam something
440.37,448.02, you know it's been to me as i am some kind of operates not availability inside of
448.23,449.22, strikes
452.19,461.4, a lot of these bits of these are also paper and it's just a library so what i'm going to do now is which is shown not of objects of this
464.16,472.98, many objects actually there are documented objects as of to day which i found out by county to help is
473.13,477.84, to night i count every help in and
479.55,488.01, make this it's already a huge number so we have an object in a thing that is similar to the health interfered
489.33,491.67, this help interval
492.75,498.75, a similar over before for the art library and that's called
498.81,499.74, view
499.95,505.02, and it's a fine open for into your path
505.23,506.67, if you open it
507.51,512.88, get this little extra over your father community
513.21,516.93, but these are you can
516.93,523.35, aristide to two sections and these other section amelie analysis into sizes
523.38,524.88, greece
525.96,530.46, you on one of these fortalice
530.67,534.18, opens up a listing of the object in or
534.33,537.9, with some kind of graphic user interface in the atelier
539.1,540.39, and
541.5,550.32, controllers there and then you can of course always go to the help filettino at it
556.83,557.91, so
559.35,566.88, i am going to start with the examples one section is called the main section 
567.09,568.5, to
568.89,572.34, small objects and bigger objects that he with translating
572.58,577.92, one real into another wild but very civil ones the escape object
579.78,582.42, just as merican
583.47,584.97, the girl
585.18,593.13, breaking the layout is similar to escape objectionable in some atalaric
593.28,604.08, oviparous and occur so can go and linacre way so far in some this one here is scaling the imputation
604.2,605.79, one hundred
605.79,607.8, seventy two
607.98,611.34, not one but using a device
611.91,613.89, if it's foster
614.64,620.94, the further you get you can also scale of course the opposite direction
621.9,623.28, can use 
624.36,629.04, the scale by the just using one year or
629.85,637.26, different kinds of scaling sociographic example as well which shows you the curves than not possible
639.06,640.47, this is the 
642.81,645.51, in this direction to justice gale
645.63,650.7, sometimes separately enables one like this they are erectile
651.99,657.21, useful there are also some more attesting objects
657.48,661.95, one is the cat dictionary convict
663.81,665.37, it
665.88,671.94, rouletabille sustain major seven cetera
674.31,676.08, i
679.62,682.71, for example if you want to play a major of seven cards
683.34,685.35, you get one here
685.92,687.15, this was 
687.27,690.45, this symbol inside the wire
693.3,695.88, so just just
696.15,707.19, because a lot of adele using his labor and the softer coming from a real musician becomes music so
707.25,711.12, it would be named so it's a part these are the cards
711.48,712.86, neither
713.43,725.88, and it was it aesthetes excluding the route notes so the rotha to be on your own you can make real progression with this
726.03,729.03, a little example which
729.36,731.55, you see a list of carts
731.82,733.05, with 
733.32,744.81, one major corn on step number one than the macadamised cornelia this in the trough
751.14,751.95, he
754.11,757.32, you can easily change to a different life
762.81,764.58, not the way
771.72,776.49, containing ornament actual columbus
777.99,780.72, controls are things that
780.81,783.15, the control not of things
783.42,789.84, metro is obvious example building contractors the timing of the rest of the path
790.02,792.63, a fading thing is 
792.69,795.12, after which i just
795.27,803.28, a thing to do you have not and this is the tree line fanariote three and puts
804.66,811.92, it accepting sickness would have theatergoing in noise going in and a face agoing in and this is the
812.19,814.23, fading signal
814.8,818.52, olga over the sweet things
818.64,828.6, and extortion you already hear the sideway so if you would go through her then i would go back to the side
835.2,841.05, and what else control or tear like this one she kept it
841.05,844.26, so stoically nice
846.57,847.95, just 
849.9,855.12, so you temporise one tis
856.44,861.33, this solemn so i used the sound in put objector
863.82,867.66, and one of the citizens leather
868.89,870.87, it
879.6,888.15, clear the tea and you see the just accounting meroe and i contact by tapping the big bank here
893.4,895.83, i didn't connect
905.82,927.39, repeating itself with sectarian domesticated into a message for the latter restored so this is just something can make a longer tetanus the temple just originated
927.42,932.01, just as the old for to make room and the asses taper
936.69,946.92, i mean that a new looming in his cretonne animation so much to have to go to everything that didn't complement the
949.32,951.3, somewhere i think that
952.38,958.02, i have again more examples of that
961.08,969.57, effects of causes big topic in the ideas it's for we have the microphone going in 
969.93,977.04, in effect on it and suddenly world different it's like undressed lots of facts
977.91,982.59, simply that i just to see aristotle all its
982.68,984.75, people like delay
984.75,991.86, works by dividing the base duration into various steps and then
992.94,995.34, think on like things
998.73,1016.34, so you see the base the racecourse of fifine milly seconds then the left divides two which means that the delay of two hundred fifty minutes seconds and the signal constraint the right side is divided by three silver over living thing then you can set her feet back
1017.12,1018.71, one for example
1019.1,1023.42, so it's not stopping there also benefit inside
1023.78,1030.89, if i would set this too small there will be up
1032.78,1048.77, when the end did we never can of course changed his
1050.3,1053.48, the ductile
1054.71,1061.73, process or is included to this another save which is the agility
1062.12,1066.59, so many armies that there was an expanse
1066.65,1078.74, it's a compression noise gave limited and pandanaceae to be more complicated to use because it has so many many pirates
1078.77,1082.43, in general i think the compress a modest like this
1082.91,1090.11, sennier and
1094.4,1102.83, i put the tretheways see under a appetite original signal and then the lower one is to compress seal
1103.61,1107.27, he can name up here
1108.32,1109.46, order
1115.34,1123.17, complicated to use that audience is as a noise which is something that is
1123.44,1131.69, important if you're dealing with on the phone you have environmental songs and sometimes it's quite separately want to have someone
1132.71,1137.3, you can athenians gave more of his panic processor
1139.49,1143.18, utilities included
1144.86,1156.8, it otherwise is dropt maybe some of you know the list of strictly to rot with the help of many others this is a huge library of
1156.98,1159.11, processing obstructions
1159.38,1162.71, and the obvious
1162.89,1165.44, full of the copies of these
1165.62,1168.74, what i considered to be the most important ones
1168.83,1177.14, the one other telesippe which just you have a list and then to the sequences serializing into it single was
1177.29,1183.14, also included the mistris mapleside so you have pitied which is 
1184.55,1191.99, botherations are of many objects in the list absolved
1193.19,1197.45, using this man and reduce antiope rations but you get
1198.02,1206.66, included in the atelier so that in most of the time like eighty ninety per cent of the time is not tournees to altitude
1206.72,1209.12, section labor
1210.77,1214.76, you have a switch the car dictionary example at
1215.09,1219.71, there asploring on there are some
1219.71,1224.57, here which help by making other objects folly
1224.96,1228.29, and this is the mate poifect
1235.79,1239.18, a little stationery is mona
1239.84,1250.61, he rose pale actually it in this play patient trying to play a fortune
1251.09,1253.07, you only hear one
1254.48,1256.55, i can replace this
1257.78,1261.92, aside or bite you make polly at
1262.31,1265.97, one wing for stealing as rolling
1266.45,1290.63, so i have paid my is entire as is realized by dynamic patching inside internally so here you have the advices realized and if i am to wellinformed sixteen that i would just say case sixteen isothermal
1293.69,1299.0, something very useful is already included in the ida library
1300.29,1302.3, you have
1302.51,1310.85, not of suicide of a patient there the very simple one which is the shock which is
1310.94,1312.11, the
1313.82,1317.6, sidenote if you know
1318.92,1379.43, includes not only the side way but also to let asia it ought to include the trainway bedlamite is little bit out with modulated square and a trying away with various parameters the trainway can be concha the slow and for the square way if you can make it out and let polwarth saw and the true when it i think he doesn't have any armies in its outpost to let them run on at the same time so secure
1379.76,1386.0, insolation is on brainwave
1386.75,1396.95, you see already forfeited the honor actually taken from the cities to a kid the parameters on the estimate to a good
1397.16,1399.59, go into martians
1399.65,1405.92, conrector bunch of synthesis we by any final
1405.92,1411.65, many others into sides already so some probably know his book and to calias
1411.71,1416.63, a lot of his expences and cities have been found their way into other
1417.02,1429.38, already demonstration he developed of my sin six or seven news into sizes they especially in for for the argent ivory
1430.97,1437.87, the help it on fortune make pedrito twentythree crash sometimes and on a wide athesis
1437.93,1440.09, so i should he said
1443.24,1448.25, tis they share the same set of armies and
1448.82,1450.86, parents
1454.64,1455.66, the
1461.33,1468.11, by the like roundelay of synthesize i sit as a graphically interface and it comes with lots of presents
1476.54,1484.16, and that's another one i just showed here it makes a completely different sounds that i use of the same program so it's quite easy to
1484.19,1486.29, these presents running
1491.33,1497.51, inside
1497.72,1499.28, what 
1500.75,1503.54, it is god
1503.69,1506.66, warships and type
1509.81,1513.38, you can fight it through birthrights overview fire
1514.82,1534.71, i think i explained this with take a little bit too long and is in its in very much detail in the paper are these objects are it's possible to stay at san everything there they include apparently to control and persistence system based on my own settin
1534.83,1537.68, the basic idea is that it
1537.71,1544.13, everything that you send to the right inlet of an abstraction a gets dispatched by special dispatcher object
1544.61,1547.58, an example the frequency modulating the
1547.73,1548.93, the
1549.11,1550.31, in the
1550.43,1554.36, and then it goes into despatcher objects so these are like 
1555.56,1561.89, partly just that his object had an artist parties ran be safe then
1566.93,1568.31, he showed
1568.43,1569.75, works
1569.75,1573.08, i have some pride outraged them
1573.47,1578.39, and if i want to save them i use this construction for
1578.9,1581.42, you somerset and receives
1581.57,1588.08, in the paper if i went to safety a click and then i get them into a message box
1588.86,1592.52, things that have changed you know when i can and so save them into a text file
1592.79,1593.99, ever so
1597.53,1599.12, in
1600.41,1612.83, i feature is the wisemen men we have special moderated system for dealing with simple tale and play back from tables into a frontal
1614.81,1620.81, basic idea is to have saddlebank objects that hold and fill the tables
1620.99,1623.72, simply one called you sample bank
1625.58,1628.31, which you just a few look at the hell
1628.34,1636.14, you created but with the name of a table in an internal table and a temple that should be loved
1636.23,1640.79, and then if we just ought to inside it has a sound far or intolerable
1640.97,1643.52, you want to play back this table here
1644.15,1646.52, you can use matching objects
1647.18,1649.82, like the late object
1650.69,1652.73, here
1653.06,1657.11, i could play battledore here at say 
1657.32,1658.58, the file
1662.06,1663.53, defile
1672.17,1678.59, this is imparting this to set the separator is used for playing back to sanctitude 
1678.59,1680.75, be the rate of the
1680.84,1685.16, the separation of the fire that you are using
1685.43,1690.38, it actually half city separate because that's what most of the stuff on the phone us
1691.46,1692.72, and
1693.59,1697.49, bank very and is the simplicity
1697.49,1706.85, more complex it only it lost it loads the complete directory with audio file by where just one object to you have a directory
1707.18,1709.97, one year in
1710.18,1712.28, going to christ
1719.33,1725.33, you see a lot of samples and an index of texts file and this map
1725.63,1731.66, simple to numbers and manual exist and play back a sample by number from this
1735.14,1737.99, how it works sandpits
1738.26,1741.53, he is the caprice object with an option of grief
1741.53,1744.41, i sent a message open at kit
1745.28,1751.04, and then i can 
1751.07,1758.3, are different it is said by open drums which were now open the other directory
1758.63,1768.74, i ate works of cross for piano sound who if you had each each the anaconda for a number from zero to one intent seventeen
1768.77,1774.08, insolent he is just a little thing
1774.11,1781.46, playing a random river and over these simple kid by by using some other object
1787.07,1791.9, i really switch on the fly on its loaded when for
1797.33,1801.11, so away
1803.33,1835.13, he has been killed future well that's much more is it the awatok at all the other objects in anecdotes so there's much more insight and i would really like to frustrated to the photinians in all nordstetten there was some talk tiring
1835.76,1839.6, asserted use
1840.44,1843.02, i only think i can invade
1843.05,1848.09, the taste of melicertes in her of life and
1848.33,1858.35, much listening to atone
1858.8,1863.03, i didn't it's in the paper but you can down it if you go to
