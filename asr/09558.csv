32.1,67.71, several moisten basically it is pickin and here have your baby i read a lot of nagasena i think immediately we were both to lake where we have to have a natural birth we have to do it the way it was you know meant to be done december thirty first new year's eve it was about six p m i reached a put my boot on and my water broke and because of the meconium we decided i needed to go into the hospital
68.46,75.66, i walked on into the delivery water and there was a nurse's desk right when you walk back and they're about four nurses sitting there
75.93,129.57, and they looked to me and said you don't look like you're in labor and i sat at a not yet oh you just wait like you will be in pain soon enough you know they were just making little comments like that like its common for a i just kind of felt like i was an inconvenient you know holding them back from whatever holiday plans they might have had with their families you know we were going on twenty four hours since my water had broken at that point of the hospital was getting cinerous that i wasn't progressing as quickly as they would have liked i was being induced he kept up in the patoisants was probably around for an on the second that the midwife came in and said okay you're going to need to have a section you know your water's been broken for too long we need to get the baby out
