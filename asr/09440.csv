7.32,14.73, and my name is hannah depend i grew up in a patetica so the work you during this recess to my heart
15.15,27.24, as you said about to create things i have full of things for you to consider the first thing is that these people all the writings are right
27.39,32.13, well from within their social system that belief system
32.34,36.63, actions and their world view mixed perfect sense
36.66,63.78, every war has been fought by people who family believed that their acting in self defence and their backed up by god and thus arguing with them deepened the divide doesn't sol sol things so i have fought to questions for you to consider the one is how might we meet there will you with respect and curiosity and the other one is how much we deepen the discourse
63.9,69.48, so we can really understand the needs and the strategies that they
69.84,70.98, suggest
71.52,89.16, the second thing is that these people may be scared andersen as a second remotion under anger is fear and cynicism understood a certain also is the fear of being disappointed again so how can we
90.24,93.96, help them then first of all feels seen
94.05,99.81, and then how make me acknowledge and welcome fear into the conversation
100.29,110.4, work with fear and even our own fear because when we do this work we are brought in recounting our own fears when it comes to the fears of a future and a country
111.33,118.83, that the thing is that james opinion as usual implications and
119.22,129.93, social units so often are and inclusion in the family or system it depends on our conformity to the north
129.96,144.54, so for people to break out of what they have inculcated to believe and do really difficult so how might we support people to be brave and takes
144.81,154.89, how might we help people to act in line with their integrity and i see a bit of picture of the world they belong
155.55,168.15, the last one is that those people there are family the one of the fat fallacies of one life is a way individuals and that our actions don't impact
168.24,177.99, negatively well family and we live in one system where when we do holothuria he also to home to ourselves
178.5,206.28, so the question for this one is how might we stand strong and our convictions that all lives and actions matter that disrespect and in acting is harmful to stanton or conviction but also remain open hearted and without loving and respectful attitude towards our dearly beloved brothers and sisters who are acting in a way that is
207.12,209.91, really damaging to collective
211.92,214.53, i really love reciting
214.77,229.29, keep going it is difficult work but this engaging in this work is the work of the thing both ourselves our design community and the world to a better place so keep i thank you
