2.58,61.38, these adorations to and got a severe and osberne
61.92,64.92, with that said first
65.34,67.5, that i taught that men
67.5,69.36, the drive out in practice
69.75,75.99, a few phrases that were direct and stern that i would use in case things been ottocento or in case people were
76.02,77.28, respectful
77.88,82.11, instantly realizing on it that was going to be necessary because the men that showed up
82.29,88.02, introduced themselves to me they sat at the edge of their seats they were eager
88.17,93.87, i realized as a woman who never grew up with her dead
94.05,96.69, i was dealing with
96.99,103.08, just some of our very basic human wounds that's what writing
103.14,104.43, addresses
104.61,115.35, and i knew in that moment that probably i would not want to teach anywhere else and i knew that it was probably going to take over a big part of my life because there was a
115.41,117.99, vulnerability and
118.14,153.33, enthusiasm and that classroom that is really rare fine on the outside
155.67,167.67, i think that one of the paradoxes that i found at least was that students would be you know they'd be really you know her to take the class but they would also have the sort of extreme
167.88,190.08, a crisis of confidence like in their own abilities prison is all about cultivating sort of you know of aside and like you know a bullet proof exterior and writing is all about sort of like cracking yourself open and becoming vulnerable and there's there's a guy in the most recent class who said that all thought of my heart as the black
190.2,196.44, burned shrivelled but he said the experience of writing as
197.64,202.26, the concert of like flatoff parts of the black here and there
202.29,204.42, see kind of the red
204.99,207.03, aristander neath
207.42,214.32, i would think that he would want to do everything possible if people were increasing to keep them from ever
214.59,217.23, back to prison if they're getting out you know
217.53,223.68, and you know to do that you have to put tools in their hands when you think that i was really
223.89,226.98, surprised by it was just how enthusiastic
227.04,230.49, procreation was to work with us in the first place
230.52,232.71, and all of the
232.83,241.65, the education directors that we've been working with have been really really supportive and they understand the value of what's going on and they want to make it
241.92,244.08, that it can continue
245.52,271.14, it developed their own little
271.17,277.92, one because they feel safe and that safety net
278.28,279.99, much stays there
280.08,290.46, the one because they have shared some things with many in many cases they've never sudermann else and so that ability to sustain a relationship like that
290.61,298.08, is no different than you are it really isn't you know they really have that same sort of need
298.2,314.58, want to connect at that level and they have been able to take this and transfer their learning to make more positive relationships with their families on the outside their children on the outside they know how to express themselves more because they thought
314.79,328.29, to bring that force and so it will really has that quite an effect not only on them in their lives while around the inside but also what they can do to develop and maintain relationships
328.41,350.58, they get on the outside as well waterhen and their family there's no easy answer there's an easy reduction
350.61,352.53, i do see that
354.45,356.22, them in some way
356.49,357.81, themselves
357.96,365.97, i'm thinking about that it with one student in particular who said that his writing class made him feel for the first time like he was a citizen
366.21,370.44, i don't know all the reasons i can only see what's coming out in the writing
370.83,376.74, i do know that there's a lot of pain that goes beyond their
376.89,384.18, their incarceration childhood pain pain from their acts and that remorse
384.36,394.56, they are creating their own criteria for what makes it a good poem what makes it strong writing and to be able to get better and better at doing that asks a lot of them
395.1,397.26, they feel they feel
397.35,399.75, he led in some way they feel
400.11,411.39, feel seen or heard
411.48,414.39, i have to think that there's some sanctuary
414.45,430.38, a class like that that they can come and be apart from the general population for a little while and feel just a little bit more relaxed just engaging in conversation and you know you listen to someone else you pause you think about it
430.38,431.58, things that
432.03,434.04, human beings to do
434.34,444.06, you know those facilities are loose a little bit or at least not completely resty when when they get out a reason i
444.12,447.3, right reason i think a lot of people
447.33,458.16, do artistic projects or other projects as to feel like they're alive in their living i think of like an assault parking lot or you know a concrete sidewalk where you
458.46,461.79, the grass of the weeds growing up in the crap
462.15,463.26, despite
463.26,464.91, the conditions
465.93,467.76, keep showing up
473.34,482.91, i can philosophically say yes if i were the victim or the victim's mother i would want to know why do any of these people deserve
483.09,486.42, attention teaching love investment
486.63,492.27, the philosophical side but were on teaching in the classroom in teaching
492.51,502.8, actual man not an abstract man as an actual man whose whose story i know well because he's been telling it to me over the course of many months
503.19,507.87, i only say that i hope that a member a victim myself
508.17,509.91, i will recognize
511.11,514.95, is a paradox that we can't escape that you can be
515.01,521.4, a person who has done an awful thing who is also capable of
522.06,528.45, and curiosity and compassion and redemption and to access all of those things
528.72,530.4, we have to give them
530.91,538.14, something really important and i don't fully understand it but i feel like it's a crucial
541.62,551.79, really significant piece of this work that we're doing looking out through the bars of myself i came my surroundings i contemplate my future
552.42,558.81, freedom is gone and life is i know it is over i think about my family and the holidays will never again share
558.9,561.93, think about melinda and the will never again make
562.26,564.54, think about the children on her father
564.81,566.88, experiences on the head
566.94,568.89, milestone till number achieved
569.43,572.28, in the back of my selling case i start to cry
572.28,573.96, i want anyone to see
574.53,577.74, what else to do so i turned to the only thing i know
577.8,597.06, i think i have you've got language under control and you are smart and have a very strong voice if i'm not mistaken you observe and understand subtle human behavior astutely that's one of the most important things a writer can do watch others with as much understanding and compassion as you can then write down what you see
597.54,607.56, same observant eye as often as possible on yourself you've gotten braver and braver about what you're willing to explore you have a unique story to tell
607.65,612.27, explore it with openness honesty curiosity and fearlessness
612.33,619.29, writing about those blind dark unexplored spots and your work will grow even more poignant and powerful
619.29,622.47, have something to say and the talent to say it well
622.68,623.94, he
629.01,633.75, the second teacher had a real right you can express it you want to change your life
633.93,641.97, and just then the separation of that just saying that i owe to your loved one or to your daughter or to you so we hit them he i want to change my life
643.83,651.18, between you and the love one you've just given birth to a dream he couldn't say that what out reading in riding the agonal burton
