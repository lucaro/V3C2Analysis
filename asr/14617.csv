0.03,9.96, i somehow have hands how many people here have heard of the ultra deep field experiment by the hubble telescope
11.31,56.43, very well strap in because i'm glad i got to tell you about this what happened some years ago was that as had completed a low resolution map of the night sky and they decided that they wanted to go deeper so they picked a little tiny patch of space a patheticness of a pencil tip at arm's length and it was black there was nothing there and what they decided they would do his point the finally one lens of the ablest little patch of space so every time the hobble came around the earth they pointed a telescope that little path to see if they could capture any photos and see there was actually something in there that was to him senor all so every time the hole came around the earth pointed it for twenty minutes and they pulled the trick off four hundred times
57.12,58.77, at the end of that
58.77,71.52, compile all the information they collected all the lonely photons that had trickled in from distant reaches of the universe and they put it together and they found that there was something in that little patch of space after all
71.82,73.65, wasn't this star
73.68,81.66, i wasn't a cluster of stars it was ten thousand dales
82.05,97.41, a is a hundred billion stars so we're talking a thousand trillion stars in the little patch of space each one of those stars just like our sun many of them presumably with planetary systems around them
97.56,103.74, all of them with the potential to how is unknown forms of biology
104.22,125.52, i think this is a good consciousness raiser to think about the size of the mysteries that surround us so i am a scientist i devoted my entire life to science because i figure if we want to understand what's going on in the strange world around us there is probably no better method than to directly study the blueprints
125.67,136.26, science and last year has been tremendously successful we have cured small pox in poland gotten men to the moon and made the internet and tripolitans
136.77,165.06, i think we really get from a life in sciences this knowledge that after you walk the pier of everything that we know insistent you reach the end of the pier and beyond the end is everything that we don't know it's all the uncharted waters the deep mysteries that we don't have insight into manvantara or dark energy are why the multiple spatial dimensions or how you build consciousness from ancient
165.33,194.61, that's the real lesson that you get from science is about the vastness of our ignorance now i have no doubt that every generation we will continue to add a few more slats to the pier but if the huge ocean and we don't really have any earth far will get and certainly in our brief twinkling of a twenty first century life time we're not going to get to the end of that and so the lesson that you did from science is that what we know is so vastly outstripped by what we don't know
195.51,219.69, given that situation i have been interested in what has happened this last decade with the books by the neo atheists and these books are some of my favorite books and they're very important and insight books but what's been interesting to me is the public reaction to the beeldars i can see something of a misconception
219.69,241.08, widely that scientists don't have the capacity to gamble beyond the available data and that scientists are acting as though we've got it all figured out we understand it atticamegues mc squared we can put in equations or if we can't yet then we're pretty close and it should suffice to capture a description of the whole cosmos
241.14,275.16, i think that's a tree not a very good description of how science actually operates ben's right when he said that science is about disputing other people's hypothesis but it's about so much more than that science is really about this creativity of making up new hypotheses and the part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple potentiality and then we go and we see evidence we gather evidence to weigh in favor of some stories over others
275.25,284.49, often the case that some questions are too far out right now they're beyond the tool box of science and as a result were unable to gather evidence for them
284.73,287.07, and in that situation it's so 
287.07,300.96, comfortable holding multiple hypothesis on the table that ambiguity is accepted as part of the relationship we have with mother nature is part of the vast mysteries around us we have to have the ambiguity
301.44,310.65, so i don't pretend like we've got it all figured out and as a result i have felt sometimes that perhaps we know too little
310.8,314.73, come to a position of strict atheism
315.09,317.22, the other end of the spectrum
317.4,339.75, no way too much to commit to any particular religious story right to their two thousand religions on the globe and had as it's been pointed out by others that every one already knows what it's like to be an atheist because only need to do is look at someone else's religion and you say well that's patently ridiculous that you would believe in that and of course they're looking back and thinking
340.05,376.32, now the holy books written by the world religions are often quite beautiful and the crystallized hard in wisdom but in fact the written lena go by people who didn't know about the size of the cosmos or the big bangor bacterial infection edna or computation or even very much about neighboring landscapes and culture so whenever i'm sitting next to someone on an airplane i ask everybody if they've ever heard of the altrimente hulton's heard of that but everybody is able to tell me all of the details of whatever cultural story they grew up on
376.77,393.42, and you don't need to mean anthropologists to recognize that our nervous systems absorb whatever our cultures pour into so few were up in saudi arabia you're in love is law and if you're born in rome of catholicism in tell amytis springfield ohio protestantism
394.32,412.56, it's not a coincidence that there's not a blossoming of is long in springfield ohio and there's not a blossoming of protestantism and me it's because we're products of culture we accept whatever is poured into us right if there were one truth you would expect that it would spread everywhere evenly big clearly the day doesn't support that
412.86,420.87, the crazy part is are cut for the stuff into us and then sometimes people are willing to fight and die over the particular stories
422.01,431.19, emerson pointed out a while ago that the religious stories of one generation become the literary entertainment of the next generation
431.46,442.71, and you can see that nobody's fighting over isis and osiris anymore or the greek and roman panoplies not so much and so
442.71,449.76, so i want even example this i don't know if any familiar with me the creation story of the cubapino in the congo 
449.97,462.12, the creation story goes like this there was a white giant named mombo who had a sharp pain in his belly and he vomited up the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars
462.78,485.91, not making this up and then he had a second pain and he vomited up the animals and people and trees and included in that second injection was and i quote the leopard the anvil the eagle women the monkey foo firmament medicine man and latin
487.23,495.81, if you find the creation story of the bakuba and unlike explanation for how we got here
495.96,508.35, keep in mind that if you were cuyo would find equally bizarre the western story of the naked couple in the talking reptile and the prohibited produce
512.31,520.23, if you were calving in kansas you would be fighting to get this in your children's text books
520.44,552.0, no i'm not suggesting that the coast is wrong or the enemy story are wrong because there are competing stories i'm suggesting their wrong because all the available evidence we can gather was against them so for example the biblical story suggests that the earth is ithers old are best science tells us that it filled so that means the biblical account has to somehow explain how the japanese were making pottery for thou years before the earth existed so
552.09,564.51, so for my money this puts me somewhere in the middle i have felt for a long time that we know too little to commit to strict atheism and we know far too much to commit to a particular religious story
565.23,579.78, so what has surprised me is the amount of certainty that i find out there so when you walk into a bookstore what you find are the books by the merits and the books by the fundamentally religious and they argue with each other and they polarize each other and there's pending all of their energies on that
580.65,581.55, and
581.73,613.62, i felt me for while i may be there should be another voice here because that seems too limited for a modern discussion because if you think about the space of possibilities right so take the whole judasians islamic tradition that's one point in the possibility space take the eastern land that's another point take the idea that were mechanical pieces and parts and we shot off meditates another point we were planted here by space they another point right when you start when you start populating the space what you realize is there are vast landscapes in between
613.68,635.88, possibilities and all of these points are infinitesimally unlikely right but together they add up to this possibility space and i feel like there's not really enough to cussin about that space instead the whole discussion has been limited to what i consider perhaps a false dichotomy this god versus no god and that's where the conversation is ended
636.51,646.74, some people in the middle position some of these people use the term agnostic i don't use that term because the way i see it used a typically is used is a weak term
647.13,655.17, often when people say they are not what they mean is i'm not sure whether the guy with the beard on the cloud exists or doesn't exist
655.59,687.33, so i don't call myself an agnostic i call myself a possibility and the idea with possibilities is an act of exploration of new ideas and a comfort with the scientific temperament of creativity and holding multiple hypothesis in mind so possible as is now eighteen months old and i first announced that when i was on a live national interview on preplanned at nitent
687.45,698.07, and when i got done with the interview i got back in my trunk and i drove over to my laboratory and valor collation where i'm a neurosis and i settle in friday work and i opened up my email
698.34,713.61, i had hundreds of emails from people and they all said he i think i'm a possibility on too so i amoretti cool so i doubled the word an interstate word didn't exist there was zero hits
713.64,728.31, so i did what anybody would do i bought possibility come and then and then i and then i waited to see what would happen well what happened has been amazing what happened is group started popping up all over the place
728.46,740.85, on face possibility groups got started the new york times in order miscarried world wide the gate time has had a beautiful piece of possibilities the india sunday times
740.91,758.91, google hits and it's really caught fire one thing i noticed that was funny as people who had heard about it on the radio didn't know he knew how to spell it or they forgot the name and so people start calling a possibility
759.06,766.95, oh you know what that's perfect that's right in the possibility and spirits go have you want to do it
768.69,779.37, the question reordering about is why what is the reason that this movement is catching on giving that it's a very strange movement in that we know subscribed to anything
780.21,799.23, so it struck me that maybe what's going on now that we passed the first decade of the millennium i think maybe people are a little bit tired of people acting as though they're certain about things that they can't possibly be certain about so they are a little tired of the debates between dawkins horses the discovery institute
799.62,801.93, and as walter said
802.17,807.99, uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd position
808.2,825.66, so i want to make two points of clarification about possibilities so one is so i feel come up to me after a talk and i say that's terrific that your possibilities glad that anything goes and possibilities and because that means you get me in terms of spinister whatever
825.75,831.69, now
831.69,856.95, is not anything goes it's anything goes at first and then we import the tools of science to rule out parts of the possibility space so it would be terrific if the speisesaal love that but to the extent that we can measure things now we cannot find any evidence to support and so the ideas you import the tools to sculpt to structure the possibility space you can rule out whole areas
857.28,862.17, and the interesting part of possibility a possibility is really picks up
862.38,905.43, where the tool box of science leaves out it's where we no longer have the tools to address it and we have to understand the space of possibilities that's where it's really important and the reason it is so important to keep that open mindedness about the part you know now is because we know for certain about the magnitude of things that we don't know so in every generation of scientists people have always felt that they have all the pieces and parts that they need in order to answer what's going on around them in the cosmos but just imagine trying to explain the northern lights in the utterance of a pump was invented
905.49,910.47, i'm trying to understand how muscles work before the before electricity is discovered
910.5,922.83, make serious but you would be doomed to be incorrect but were in that same position now so we've got you tonantis physics and corn mechanics and we think okay we sort of got all the pieces in parts
922.95,932.76, on the one hand there's all the unknown unknown all the stuff we don't even know we don't know but what i want to emphasize is all the stuff that we know for sure we don't know
933.12,944.91, something like dark matter right so astrophysicists look at the movement of the plans and the galaxies and they look out on the moving around and they look at the gravitational pull and what they realize is
945.03,953.19, missing there's something out there that we can't quite see or smell or touch but it must be there to make the equations work out to make the movements
953.46,956.73, in the cosmos explained and so we're going to
956.73,966.24, alligator and we're going to call it dark manner and the idea is that dark manner is the thing that we don't exactly know what it is but we require it to make the equations work out o
966.42,975.48, may already know dark matter is not a tiny fudge factor percent of the known universe is what we call dark matter
975.81,983.58, a lot to sweep under the rug
983.91,987.87, and this is what i study i go in a very day in study the human brain
988.32,1017.06, the most complicated devices we have ever found in the universe is essentially an alien kind of computation material and it is so tense in its connection that if you were to take a cubic millimeter of brain tissue there are more connections in there than there are stars in the milky way galaxy so this is incredibly complex and yet somehow this wet mechanical network system here is you it's all your hopes and dreams and aspirations
1017.36,1061.76, somehow that if you were to lose a little part of your pink and you wouldn't be any different but if you lose an equivalently sized piece of neural tissue that completely change is your conscious state right well the problem is we don't know how to take mechanical pieces in parts and build private subjective experience out of that imagination ineradicable in this touch of that that causes that and so on at what point do you add one more ticket and then you say it's experiencing the taste of fetiches now right that's the problem we don't know we don't have any way to take our equations and say it will just carry the two and to a triple in and then that you know that feeling don't
1061.91,1071.87, do not have a series of how the brain works we don't even know what such a theory would look like a tall of this calls for a bit of intellectual humility
1072.65,1085.88, i was giving this talk recently and somebody came up to me afterwards and said drawing the talk he said you know i think you should become a politician because you're unintimidating
1086.09,1087.47, send to me
1087.53,1091.37, and commit to something
1091.73,1097.73, so i thought about that so in texas where i come from we have the lovely expression a cowboy 
1098.03,1120.8, means to firmly commit to a decision and we really value the straight people we like people who can firmly commit two decisions so if you're trying to decide should i think the catlin the rain or should i marry this woman should i sell the ranch we like people who can make a really firm decision but when i'm going to suggest is that there are some domains were its appropriate to condense
1120.92,1125.57, stop a guy on a ranch and say tell me
1125.6,1147.17, you think there are extra rest real civilization do you care what his opinion is would you value it more than say an astrologist and if you wouldn't ask him about expressions that suggests that there are some domains in which it is not appropriate to commit an act like you know the answer in the absence of having good evidence
1147.53,1177.68, so the next time someone says to you the cowboy up and commit to a decision i suggest that you tell them no i would rather die out any idea decking out is having a creativity for new narratives and a comfort level with holding multiple possibilities in mind and you should feel free to sit the gospel of science the most important three words that science ever gave to human kind
1179.93,1186.05, message to you is this when you leave here and you go back out into the strange world
1186.26,1206.78, try to seek comfort with having multiple narratives and uncertainty and this is not just a place for simple open mindedness but for an active exploration of new ideas i think this is important for our education for our legislation for perhaps the future of our warfare so when you leave potful of ideas
1207.14,1216.92, go back and look around the strange world you're in and see if you can live a life that is free from dogma and full of awe and wonder
1217.16,1218.72, see if you can
1219.05,1223.76, celebrate possibility and praise uncertainty
1223.82,1234.86, very much
