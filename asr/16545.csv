1.05,10.98, very few people understand what a scientist does day in an day out religious plunk it into this liquid nitrogen
10.98,23.43, a lot of students think they're mattabeeset is we want to be in the sciences professions so i participate in the short program they get to see a little bit of that
24.15,39.21, so the shirt program at stone house an opportunity for students to get into a research lab and get practical experience in chemistry or biology or environmental sciences and really built on the skill of landless
39.51,51.63, something unusual because a lot of college either have limited access to it no access to research that stone how good portion of our researchers take on summer students and we do this every single summer
52.11,61.8, i have a fifteen year relationship with which holographic institution it is one of the world's best private research foundations
62.46,72.96, bringing my students down to its hole to do our research begetter act with some of the best minds in the world on different topics and rinchengong merely
74.34,78.96, our hypothesis is that the organic input from the oysters
78.96,95.37, stimulating the process of the nitrification and then so we're studying the micrometer in the sentiments and then the sinking organic material ornate beginning of the summer
95.4,99.36, working very closely with presages
99.45,119.61, he did his best to teach us all we needed to know and then let us work independently he trusts us with being able to carry out tasks because he knows that in the real world you're not going to have a mentor looking over everything you do any really let us grow into the scientists that we are
120.18,128.91, i don't really expect to see high rates of detraction or antitoxin these because there had amenities there
129.09,130.98, don't have a special because
131.01,133.14, keep our classes really small
133.17,137.91, means that the students and the professors continently and of the
137.97,171.3, my research students to summer were kids that i had in my general chemistry classes and that was able to pick them out from the crowd say he i would really like you to come work with me if you're interested in doing this with a work dan is an engineer part of what i do in my lobstein building instrumentation and so i chose dad to come and help me not only do the field work for the socrates building instance that we need to analyze the sands so denistoun a massacree that will use in my lad three years to come
172.71,209.73, one of the most valuable things about being able to do research this summer has been just being able to figure out whether or not researches the right fit for me you don't really find that at most undergraduate institutions and that's why this summer has been such a good experience working on a project like this is really providing me with knowledge base that i can hopefully take wherever i go your actually out there implementing solutions so that's been really cool to see and very valuable experience
