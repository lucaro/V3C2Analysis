30.54,42.99, welcome to the science change here in beautiful downtown adelaide and to night we have a discussion on the science behind the headlines of the marrying water
43.26,69.12, if you are what turning in from home and you have a question please follow the conversation on the toothaches hash and that de b plan or hash or i as we look forward to hearing from you wherever you are and of course ladies and gentlemen here in the audience you will have the opportunity towards the end of the evening to ask your questions of report
69.54,70.83, talking about
71.55,73.95, how do you measure
76.17,82.8, how do you determine what's important and what not and had to make every one happy
83.1,91.71, where does the science fitting and how do we use it towards making better decisions also making sure that the river
91.77,95.01, remains a valuable asset for australia
95.04,103.62, to night we have an expert panel to discuss the science behind the marry darling river and the plan that has been put together for him
103.83,134.97, light is an gentlemen my first speak of to night my first guest is director of the marrying fresh hat of research center based in wodonga victoria previously he was officer in charge of the milder abortive for the married darling research center before becoming the director of the centre in two thousand and two ladies and gentlemen would you please we come to the stage doctor benton welcome
136.32,141.99, go right back to basics pen because it would strike me that
142.62,144.48, the core of it
144.6,151.14, science behind managing the river is working out how much wages in and how you divided up
151.29,189.45, more complicated and that isn't an absolutely and that's why i peasegood the government had to mission he orotund type with his tanfield project just to work out how much water was in the system and what we might expect in terms of where the water was going to go and flow under a fridolina just knowing how much water there is in my service and grammatically complicated and name working out had a divided up between the various uses his arsenically complicated and part of it to talent with that is that no matter what you do with water somewhere in the basin evil have cascading affix
189.45,223.71, someone else or something else somewhere in the bison so how do you actually go about moving water as a case of you just have a lot of rain gauges across the basin and you added allan while this daurfoot as having given a lot of money to try and develop better environment all monitoring of fatefully there is both ran for models which look at the amount of rainfall of fondant run off models that tillotson it into the train that's one for information but the nitrate
223.98,249.69, many of them are accessible through the web to give you regular discharge now some of them are a little bit old and not particularly accurate and some of them fell in the year the overtop by floods but that's that network of gaming stations to provide them manahem water there is this also an extensive network of granados that tells papenhagen in good house soles whether libels are going up and down it must also be difficult in the
250.26,318.42, the boundaries of the married darling a difficult to from a hydrogen sense a kind of difficult to define you know i can maybe pick the ridge of mountains as being one particular boundary but when you go down into the ground as you say you've got ground water how far down do you go where that water is actually part of the cycle and indeed how far happened to the sky to go and measure and try and incorporate what wards going to be coming into the system that way if anthemion complicated by putting pipes and centropolis that were crossed before noon of victory dissected a pipeline to order out of the basin that now he can shorten the basin so yes it's also other connections and in this though the wild life and birds that responded a continental scouts that are only respect the basin is an equal entity they had across the continent and with the migratory birds had up to japan and korea and yet its connections by it from awarding tective with upon them and with the glow and not wishing to supernumerary in the discussion of this point but
319.08,381.72, question of making people happy is anybody happy with the plan come up i have met anywhere in killing in this sort of exercise its realistic to expect anybody to be happy this is about making trade off and so i think it's inevitable that it doesn't matter what you end up with it that no one's going to be entirely satisfied so they are of compromise is not my king every one happy is having a solution that every one can live with it is also recognizing that this is not about developing a magic powder or magic answer round the seaport of the process we got here two hundred years ago we tried to make the best of the landscape in the resources that are liable to us we didn't really know what we were doing with no whole bunch of unintended consequences in which thing i came buster we wanted to be we want to be somewhere else but we're not going to get there with one piece of legislation or with one turning of a tap it's a process we are on and were going to the basin plantation palefaces but it's not hendiest we will continue to improve their knowledge of the system
382.02,395.31, see what the consequences of this reform prices are and then we'll review it and will come back and say you is giving us a social economic rameau then you'll be more reform but it is
395.7,397.92, the complex system in east
397.98,404.58, you know there's no manipulation fortunately i would carry well mitring another
404.97,433.02, enter the state late in gentlemen currently ameres professor of monarchies and member of the malarial authority yet it move a long one if you like nanomaga a gentleman well yes professor berry poverty or spent in secesh water at college
433.02,437.01, perhaps you would be the person who could explain to me
437.22,471.09, what is meant by environmental flow what is it what is a river look like when it has a good environmental flow looks like it is in the man is this platformed flogging through most of the tea marianina that the big challenge that we've got is that there's been said were modified the flowers particularly in the southern basin which i think major esperos interested in were really modified the small to medicine flights can do much about the big ones
471.18,478.35, there's lots of flooding going on at the moment but certainly i was medium to
478.44,483.09, small to medium flats there the ones at the dame capture
483.27,484.77, and
484.83,497.04, the ones that are very important so that the flowers that that would go into a wayland plan perhaps once ere two years once every four years that sort of
497.04,537.57, frequency is taking out pretty much but then as you said we've modified the river sistently that environment like river edmonstone which require regular heavy fanning in order to rather irregular heavy flooding in order to germinate the seed or a they're not getting what they mean to perpetuate were read been away certainly the if we just fishermen on the sun system they are between like hunsdon to a bataille in limitations to get reasonable reasonable flooding
537.78,554.13, very good and there are some modifications of course that had been done to barnabas and a couple of the other areas that gets water on on to those edicts the area farther down so from rondure the ninth the river and starvin
554.16,577.53, that really is a bank stared for those large oranges and with respect to environmental flows the current plan i gather came out with a number of two thousand seven hundred and fifty giggled as being appropriate for the environmental flow
577.53,590.13, but wasn't the original estimate between three thousand and four thousand picadors and wide it change were original came out in the guard was actually glad i met
590.13,612.96, was a fairly back to the one in which the methods now but the original methodology was one where we really just looked at what was the end of system for from each of the catchment coming into the main stem and an eliciting a proportion of that which brought it from a rarebit the three thousand a little bit more than that
613.05,615.06, even the
615.21,626.04, we looked at the impact very reasonably curse look at that date at the impact of that on the communities and irrigates
626.07,631.05, and decided and this has betrayed of the stakeout before
631.2,642.81, a number of us that for howell as far as we could go there subsequently we've done a heck of a lot in war much more the prenatal about science
642.84,654.99, the opening scene is behind what's that now is hugely better from that fairly broad brush approach that was used originally
655.05,670.71, and that's a large amount of modeling log amount of science that's going into the particular assets particular areas that the dateline wet lands the risen soul or that we believe need need wood
670.8,688.38, we have to decide what it's all very well talking about an ecosystem of what you actually mean by that ecosystem so i came down to birds come out a fish comes down the red gums comes down to a hut a number of other components are all those systems which go to the man
688.44,694.23, the ability of the ecosystem but on in its natural state
694.41,700.26, one hundred percent of the water would drain environmental flood so has the
700.29,711.93, the evolution of the science behind the water management being a case of how much we can take out for other purposes or has it
711.99,728.1, it seems to me the way it's involved is actually the inverse of that that we've taken out whatever we've wanted for irrigation for industrial uses whatever and now were saying all we've actually got to take something back from those other uses
728.4,733.86, how do you quantify what those guns are oh i think there's no question that that
733.86,745.35, the scenario you just painted there is exactly what happened over last year that the major focus as barely been consumptive use
745.44,780.45, and we actually even caneback this up on shore that we have really find in terms of really working through all the science that we now we've got a reasonably large basis besides i think it's a very good start to be able to put the basin plan into endecott these at this stage but as a scientist i would not say that we are in really really good shape there are many shapes particularly the relationships between flood what does it mean for components of the ecology
780.63,785.91, so we're still going to look to learn the candidate that
786.48,789.06, sort of mention natural and
789.06,824.37, no one would have talking back getting into natural the basin plans very clear about trying to protect and restore the environmental values that we currently oenothera described in the basin can and that lige the around by verse so preserving the diversity of species and preserving the diversity of egotisms within the basin so that as a very different prospect to actually restoring the whole system back to to anything like natural saying what are the diversity of the caesars will got another diversity of plants animals were her many of them do we have to maintain furthest generation to be out in joy them or export them
824.4,837.36, why which is what was stability is all about so toilsomely challenging questions there in terms of science how many region parents do you need to minimize the risk the dagonet to in some
837.39,839.16, tom in the future
839.37,876.18, and it also of question is that science is really got a grapple with it were on to achieve that protecting restore objective were being used little more falefa samattar of the science what was science says here and described me what that science is a wearing about war arter all rainfall tables and we talking about studies of ecological systems and are talking about models of how they operate what is the science that went to ogallalla host is no question at all berthe two major components
876.18,877.59, the horology
877.71,887.37, emily changed as i described before and what does that mean for the colony of those water dependencies
887.49,898.95, the two mangoes but some of my colleagues on the authority would also had you that there is additional appreciates what the water act
899.16,907.26, in vision been used the words best available science with with expanded that if you like to
907.26,910.14, to also include social sciences
910.17,925.32, really weren't it wasn't in visage very much and i believe in the water and if you like the economics have incorporated the solarite river surveys to things
926.25,975.24, the logical sightlessness will look that comes back littlemere we set the equation migration i think he is very much about returning waterwheel simple equation at the same time minimized the social and economic impact because ben sees there is no way we can agebat natural we've got a system that that has lots and lots of components in it the lots of communities lotteries lots of production the secretary so that is the question more for the environment they then you come back to saltwater reasonable not why how are you doing it and what a really what are the reasonable minimization of the impact
975.24,986.07, that's where the social science only comes in society canonic is in terms of the impact on communities and the irrigation community
986.07,990.12, from readjusting the existing system
990.21,1016.46, which which is out of balance or i let sir speaking of out of balancement balance up the panel out my third guest to night ladies and gentlemen member of the wentworth group of concern scientists and previous chief signs adviser to the australian national order commission de plasencia doctor richard davis 
1017.39,1022.67, richard the things the conversation being going so far
1022.97,1025.73, i think the issues you've been raising are exactly
1025.73,1030.41, the issues that need to be talked about and exposed his last discussion of
1030.47,1034.97, in social science with the physical and ecological sciences really important
1035.0,1037.67, that information is going to come together
1037.73,1044.54, before decision might just come i get a sicht had to palliate the water to what or another and i think
1046.16,1053.42, that logical physical science is quite strong actually in australia and i think the marianas authority is pulled together
1053.48,1058.82, most of the information a couple of missus pelage most information in that area
1059.15,1065.0, a sign somewhat less so we know less and its mahadeo predict it to more uncertain area
1065.03,1068.48, when you get to the social science here i think that has been
1068.48,1075.11, by in the collecting of information and then the ring offered into making decisions that the plan
1075.17,1092.57, your wish thee when words group of concern signed their principal mission is the welfare and the science behind the welfare of the marrying and you originally involved with the marrying basin plan
1092.81,1094.97, then you've guys pulled out
1095.3,1098.96, pulled out because you didn't like the science
1099.02,1103.25, so again what did that sin book like and what we are problems with him
1103.31,1111.92, the primary issue for the wind was group was not patient itself as i said a minute ago the physical science of particulars quite strong
1112.07,1144.32, in that area it's the decisions around the sides and here's going to be used that i think is our principal concern or how soldier let me give you an example there's a lot of uncertainty about what you will get if you provide bareback to the environment will these revered comin recover or not will fish breed or not will ebuda lot of uncertainty no sort of areas so i give all that uncertainty and given the difficulties for many many years now and trying to recover waterbath environment
1144.35,1188.48, water was very very hard to get it back that's one of the fundamental wisdom we know from the married arline given the critical montereno where were exigeante available from the federal government were got a legislation and a plan that's been put together this is the moment to get aright because we're not going to have this opportunity again for a very very long time that means that we've really got a girl on the side of giving if necessary too much moderatus we can always return it to the consumptive side of ye have to its very hareton enta side they're given to sorts of parameters at or around the decisions we would hope to see that the science are that underlies the plan is being used in what our collie way
1188.57,1194.96, unfortunately it doesn't appear to me to be as wise as it could be for example
1195.23,1200.24, always this pushed to try and reduce the amount of order that's been returned to the environment
1200.24,1206.15, we started seceders and some scenarios we work our way down to outfielders
1206.3,1220.91, trethowen they're iglesias in that direction to try and be as niggardly as possible about how much is returned at a time when i think we need to return more because we know it give a bed to consumption if we need to later on
1221.45,1225.5, that's a sort of surrounding issue that is of concern to us so
1225.62,1239.6, as are on the other side of the fence at another that but cannagosta we are never satisfactory henriette cantatrices point beginning at the right to 
1239.75,1241.46, i challenge that
1241.64,1255.98, i think that's really feasible and that's why with extended if you like the time between hurling the basin the basin first place in plain will be accepted bateese
1256.19,1267.32, when everything kicks in mattathias corycian in and we've built built what we hope will be an adaptive plan
1267.56,1271.22, that recognizes that you don't get a right first out
1271.46,1290.87, what about the consumptive use that had years surprise to get abroad in the still lots of pots of things i give ye done very differently they so i think it's really important young
1290.9,1299.72, that's really what we're going to be trying to do and i think that's the way to do it there are some challenges and there are some risks
1299.78,1315.68, but but this is a big plan i think the premier a little bit wrong when he said the authority now has all the authority to do this if it won't work without a very close interaction with the states
1315.68,1325.34, like all that actually touches on the sultanate of anitoo bring up an that is the teeth of the murrain bateman if he like
1325.46,1327.2, i've had a cynical
1328.19,1329.87, in that
1329.87,1332.84, because it's a federal initiative
1333.08,1345.59, trying to interact with the states that it's not much good teeth as big in the the most effective legislation based that they can operate from his transaction
1345.62,1353.0, which is about migratory birds it's an international convention of the signatories to
1353.15,1354.35, so
1354.47,1359.75, the biggest leverage that the face of god and the whole process
1360.98,1365.42, actions that conserve areas where birds were breeding
1365.63,1367.04, therefore
1368.33,1370.94, biggest stick the can be wheeled
1371.09,1394.16, trying to get a plan through a living talking to one in many cenci think there's a little bit initiation tradesman others diversities
1394.19,1402.56, that allows the authority to do certain things in various states but i would i would say that if we have had to use that
1402.77,1404.42, something's filed
1404.63,1416.81, so i think the way things are going at the moment the etherages between the states who have caught legitimate concern about the ranch
1416.84,1433.01, where where where we have to try to to breach that is to look at the system as a whole and that's why i said i that's it it's a challenge in it in our federal system but but where a fool will be firing if we didn't really challenge that
1433.04,1439.19, strongly richard would take to get the windward group backing to the fullest were to get them
1439.49,1449.87, another whole printing it along till narrator
1449.9,1460.79, major objections that prevent you from going back into that table while i thought i think what a raise before he certainly one of them that if we could see that the india
1460.79,1463.55, the federal government and in fact all of the government
1463.58,1479.09, willing to take a more or but i say risk free approach so that instead of trying to give his little wages possible to the environment which i think is what is being the pressure always coming down at the moment
1479.24,1484.88, willing to be more generous about that with the understanding that the adept of approver talked about
1484.94,1558.17, truly kick in and there would be a depth you pushing it down the whole time i very much fear that when adaption of the derogation fifteen are for example neteen for at dotation to occur i would be very surprised i've not seen it in the past were in suddenly word was given back to the environment again at poison that one direction so as a salaaming the moment is now when we should take a more generous approach to the order that environment gonad because that one way direction contient ugh the additional process later on of needed i think the real disagreement here is not around the science and its rendering worth graniani is really around the assignment of reefs in hauch esquire appeared to a portion to the environmental assets that which carteret verses the the social and economic asset and that our beef preadamite that the science of the malites quite weak at articulating on the risk stare for the environment so if if we do take to decorate we say where we're going to screw the environment and is because we think it to be a minimum one of the risks are and out how like the use of that going to be successful whereas from the social in economic identically the economic side where people have
1558.23,1561.29, very strong feelings about
1561.5,1566.18, the reading in terms of loss of town portmanty lotions
1566.18,1575.96, it very clearly articulate the risk and sorry babette's on by the side abides seeing that that that rises and
1576.17,1595.1, knowledge and taken into account where is because the science is very poor saying this is how much requesting their decision for the environment side it tends to get overlooked in this light you ran through a process of bein order to describe the foreparents for recomforted tintern to an average foddering to fall
1595.28,1606.29, and then instead of a just being a guide around which indeed have very aconites the rule and so you say well we anahita us on this megalostrata red gum parasha
1606.32,1607.85, not true
1607.88,1610.25, we are good at telling
1611.45,1621.89, poacher the rest in this question and who should be the and should they be born equally between the various uses of the system the chair of the morgan
1621.89,1623.96, he
1624.05,1639.59, crossed that i used to use and end of system flow model man that that was too simplistic or what he talking about what beloved to arletta's what i was trying to whereto get too before that other in the guard
1639.59,1645.53, because of time constraint we did use it in a system flows it was basically going back
1645.53,1650.15, what the model so it was like before development
1650.18,1670.25, and apportioning a certain amount of that and became sixty percent came to the bat to three thousand adipose or natural contortion thousand on so that's the simplistic ally i did cantankerous and toward richard said before
1670.28,1684.68, i said at the action before the war that has another companion that i should have mentioned so we've got a science what's the environment name with all the heredities that means just talked about
1684.74,1687.77, social economic impacts
1687.77,1702.32, and that's good learner aunties and the but at the boy we've got a set of constraint this is a system and you say that all the retorted is a healthy working river
1702.68,1714.86, neglect all talk about a healthy working system which is talking about where you broader system second but if you look at that we've got a series of constraints
1714.86,1717.02, we are not permitted
1717.17,1730.34, have the bank flows that flood private covers we we cannot put an environmental flow down and flood shipped or madura yours pretty hard to do it when food
1730.4,1736.7, so the conscripts are real constraint in the system at the moment
1736.7,1738.5, that's part of
1738.65,1743.27, what we would say is the process between two these
1743.39,1762.86, it an angling to try to get a number of those constraints there are physical constraints there are priesthood there are properties you can't inheritance this constraint bad the actual reservoirs that we cannot let let enough oregon of them
1762.95,1767.24, the constraint in terms of the rules that are being developed
1768.53,1777.17, years are almost a total looking at consorting uses and not the environment the way the rivers run
1777.26,1782.15, totally for pretty well totally for con something used
1782.15,1789.62, and here is noted he made the water in summer bicycle environment made enemies spring
1790.04,1803.42, consonants is been in one of her concerns also bury that these constraints releast is no question about that i don't want to foodships earrings of go under
1803.54,1808.34, remember this ten billion dollars billion dollars that come of government is put up
1808.34,1842.54, put this plan into place now when you think about that these straits start to look less serious if you really wanted to be you can shift that bred you can raise the bridge you can do other things to make more water out of these dams so some of these constraint for always be difficult i agree you don't ever want to be floating shipton or some of the other towns before you geniuses you could taste the people of ship and as we toothache things that you can adjust and the one lot of money on the table available to do this so to see these constraints is being at the end of the day what holds down to two thousand seven hundred and fifty anglers is quite out officiating
1842.63,1847.37, be more convinced of a plan that as i say took this optimistic view of about
1847.4,1853.85, getting water back to the environment that we return lighter from fact we gave too much back for the benefits were gone
1854.54,1874.52, and overcome some of the constraint for the funds that are available and i'd be more optimistic about a plan that took letterpress then a plan we have and the editor that we have at the moment with so much at risk in this devotion light at times how readily this the signs get lost
1874.55,1877.61, what can you do to defend
1877.67,1880.82, since behind the madonna
1881.75,1889.13, athenian the stationariness pretty much lost
1889.34,1896.93, certainly we've been going around and the whole of the basin with public meetings and not at a round table
1896.96,1898.25, discussions
1898.4,1904.37, and many many issues come out but the primary ones are bad communities
1904.61,1910.55, the impact of communities that the thing that's really really high
1910.55,1912.68, in that
1912.86,1921.56, to what richard says there's a number of issues that the marriage annoying to combat her
1921.68,1947.45, the water at last to do certain things and not to be other things that he had a nonillions billion dollars that richard talks about is not an now graille hands is it in the departement a different population and its being challenged in a number of ways his brain
1947.45,1951.92, some changes to the local communities
1951.98,1955.04, a pretty much against the back
1955.31,1963.41, process and the government modified that slightly that would rather march the money going into infrastructure but it's her relation infrastructure
1963.41,1967.1, some of the other infrastructure that riches are an
1967.19,1976.79, i think all of them have to be on the table how biggest problem is not that we don't recognize at those situations is how do we put it
1976.88,1978.77, to a secretary
1979.01,1987.65, ilaria di can it can you sell the science
