576.78,603.99, petersburg toothache also
612.27,618.33, to 
625.77,641.79, there are many ways to create pottery you know those nice little balls of clay or those cuts of the jar at the ripetta decorations
642.39,646.17, we see in stores or we've made it our home or
646.17,648.27, have some of wherever
648.84,652.02, we then made a medical but one point in line
652.65,655.32, there are many ways to create
655.47,657.12, but design
658.08,662.67, of the art form that had been found all over the world
662.91,665.19, many many
666.96,675.6, one of the most famous way to create pottery that we know about to day is using the potter's wheel
675.9,682.62, this after quire misplay steady hand and a steady foot and of course the wheel
683.13,689.85, the potter takes a love of clay put it on the will and began to spend
689.85,709.47, a heavy man and how out allowing the potter to them places hand into the clay to shape the clay whichever way he would have it to go a bow a plate a small jar whatever the desired shape may be
710.19,724.26, during the process sometimes the clay can become too wet or it can become too hard and it can mar the initial act of what the potter wanted it to look like i can be formed the clay
725.82,737.4, i mean it's throwing the potter can simply to take the clay and either add more clay to little at a little water to its slowness the well down our speed the willet
737.58,739.5, continue making
739.74,741.78, the item of choice
742.14,746.67, the clay is not won simply because it has gone
746.7,749.16, what appears to be control
749.7,756.45, not here today to teach you how to make clay or use the pottery wheel or anything of the sort
758.25,762.81, here to have help you made me understand this message just

777.54,784.14, now if it's my finery can mould it and shape it whenever you want it
785.52,796.59, if it's more than as you can shape and moulded into what you wanted to be and if it's too hard it may be too fragile and possibly break
797.04,803.4, it's too wet it may not be firm enough to handle the pressures that are being pushed up
803.4,804.66, against the
805.08,809.55, the state is an it's fixable with some time and patience
809.58,816.93, a little water on the dry spot a little meeting of the dog to get out some of the latter spot
817.08,823.17, the good thing about clothes is that one spot does a ruin the potential creation
823.92,826.05, of our lives are like clay
826.2,828.18, radish
828.33,836.7, how to dry we may not always let on to it and most of us conceal art more places there will
837.12,841.47, the more the one or two people have been to know that our condition
842.4,849.45, we as human often take on strong personalities and find ways to cover our weaknesses
850.14,859.47, today now that all of our weaknesses are not that every air pocket on a wheel does not negate the beauty
859.5,861.51, a bead
861.9,868.47, weaknesses gives space and opportunity for god the great potter to come in and stop in us
868.53,870.54, his power and might
871.47,877.95, the profit was given the challenging task of warning israel about their wicked ways
878.25,881.04, they were once again falling off course

956.28,957.93, then life happened

966.48,975.48, work or family met we have the pressures of life had become too much we create new idol to worship
975.51,978.12, kind of way from the faith of god
978.12,980.91, to beg their own problem
981.39,985.47, an infant we have become as fragile as the clay
985.59,993.66, meeting to get back on the wheel we become tired of the every day routine and are in need of something different
993.87,997.14, we are the clay and god pan

1030.53,1034.22, the powder pan there are choice to be made
1035.54,1039.41, we allow our ills to come back together and be rewarded
1040.37,1044.15, we say as we are following away and bring
1044.36,1046.52, and to our lives
1047.48,1050.57, we could fix ourselves we would have done so
1050.57,1052.1, a long time ago
1052.55,1060.29, i have you will you let your witnesses be opportunities for god to come and we work you for his purpose
1060.5,1064.97, you had them giving them room to spread throughout other areas of your life
1066.35,1068.93, in more harm than good
1070.1,1074.36, i want to share with you a familiar story about a cracked pot
1075.53,1083.84, there was a water baker who was going back and forth taking water from the strain to her master's house
1084.2,1091.4, one part was perfectly round perfectly symmetric had no cracks no holes or anything
1091.61,1092.9, the other
1092.96,1094.34, a crack
1095.36,1101.27, marriage young lady would walk to the stream and get water and by the time she made a bag
1101.42,1102.62, the house
1102.95,1106.28, pat with the crack had lost half of its water
1107.18,1108.77, perfect pot
1108.86,1116.18, self being very bashful and proud of the fact that it carried all of its water may get everything so diligent it was
1116.3,1118.88, for the job
1119.99,1123.65, began to make the crack pot fell
1123.68,1125.54, about himself
1125.6,1127.73, ashamed of whom he was
1127.91,1133.16, he cried out to the young lady and say i'm sorry
1133.67,1134.99, she worked
1135.14,1141.71, there were why are you sorry why are you ashamed to he said to her because
1142.01,1143.99, every day you work hard
1144.26,1150.44, get the water back and by the time you get back i lost half of my water
1151.04,1153.23, so she sent the pot
1153.26,1155.69, no need to be ashamed
1155.9,1160.16, i know about your crack for two years
1160.19,1162.38, and so i planted flowers the
1162.56,1166.58, as you feel will go back words are beautiful
1167.09,1174.17, so as they went back and the crack pot saw that there were flowers on his side and not on the other side
1174.32,1177.5, even though it was beautiful and even though i was great
1177.83,1180.68, but to the end it was still ashamed
1181.31,1190.91, she assured him again now little pot the beautiful flowers that you have water i know the beautiful flowers that i take to sit on my master's table
1191.51,1194.48, you have done a great jar
1194.96,1196.76, a little pot that there
1197.48,1200.21, still wanting to be ashamed still wanting
1200.33,1202.58, to be fed but the beauty
1202.61,1205.01, had come from the water poured out
1205.16,1207.5, and all the better
