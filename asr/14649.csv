509.22,512.64, in favour of red ribbon
513.15,530.01, that every day i came a red ribbon down to chris tentacles and she stares at an iron at every day a red revenges how intense i am about this you know you often wonder how movements get started and how things come to be and i think the story of how
530.22,532.05, renee to about
532.17,536.19, is really a beautiful beautiful story you will
536.49,566.16, rosie and all started with an rickmore a drug and horsemen agent was working on a case in mexico and he was brutally murdered by drug traffickers his home town community in florida started with just a handful of people around the kitchen table and they were so outraged by his murder that they decided to take it upon themselves to start a group to make a difference in the war against drugs on a non criminal to
567.27,598.29, to me that's an incredible story and you shows what people can do if they want to i would love to see a time when during a red ribbon weak in macanoche lotuses that right three times in a row a during red rimmed weak and lagos every three single person in the city would be wearing one i'd be amazing it less an folks know that we're not going to take any more march

778.98,785.91, and you discovered about per cent of the cases when people are given a chance to do something about it
786.21,792.93, the great participation in the community collation but it still
793.14,797.19, just a very small percentage of the community that's involved in it
797.43,819.0, you can imagine what would happen if this whole community got involved in the coalition ribbonism way ah it is a way for you to do something then take on a time not of the work all you have to do is to wear a red ribbon and maybe attentive if you like to but it's a way that you can really say i wish the something i can do
