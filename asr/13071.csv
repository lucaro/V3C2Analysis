1.95,15.54, i dine here with calligenia i would like to do some live demonstrations on how one can do clear if you had the desire to learn i can definitely teach you so let's constant it
15.87,53.52, and i'd like to demonstrate clearly on her dogeared and first we're going to begin by what kind of hands i would recommend there is the old fashioned dipping type of pen like this and you can use it to be in to start with or very very cheap to buy in the fordable to start with however there's nothing more frustrating for me to do a beautiful big swirly stroke and running out of a in the middle of it so that's why i don't recommend the dipping style of mind and pen what i do recommend is the
53.55,76.95, good or fashion in a cartridge like this and it's italy a man that's flat across like this it's called the manuscript and is not expensive either and we can definitely begin with that and i'm going to show you how to insert the incantation inarticulate this
77.67,94.65, and is flat at the bottom with a bottle neck of top the bottle neck a portion of the net of the cartridges what goes inside o and and you have insert a lot of force until it pops
95.64,109.92, say i saw there was a lot of forest there and dumpy afraid of applying the forest to insert the cartridge into the abortion of the pan and then you have turned it for good contact
109.95,113.85, and then you have the barrel and you
114.06,136.98, ted back on and now you're ready to get started i don't recommend putting the top part of the pin on the back part of your pen because that throws off the balance of writing so it's better to keep your top over here and now you can start
137.1,145.5, now in order to make sure we have in flowing i dip my nether little bed into the water
145.62,170.4, and pulling on paper to no paper tells are very important because there's a lot of tooth to the paper and he can really draw the ink from the incertitude the nip really well and then this tells you you got your inflowing if you have a brand new nib this could take some time because you have to literally break in a new nib
170.4,182.1, we have the ink flowing to the near properly having checked with the paper towel were going to rest but the narbonne paper a forty five degree angle
182.61,190.68, like this and then a forty five degree angle and draw up on that angle sat very fine stroke
190.86,192.96, this is
194.01,202.98, the angle you keep the pen nib at all times to create everything and you get all your thicken in strokes where they belong
204.0,219.69, this is very important to do to begin even to the stay after thirty nine years experience i always start by doing this because it tells me the mediating the ink is incorrectly and that's all set to start
221.76,226.35, and whence he feel comfortable doing that you can go
226.41,227.64, straight down
228.54,275.31, and that the bottom can see forty five degree and go there and the forty five is of course at the top and you have your thin and tiktok where belongs and this is just done on cheek bone paper do not advance in some expensive paper at this stage of the game because you're going to waste a lot of paper to start so and don't use any lines on the paper that becomes a crutch later on so i teach all masterhood cigar beautifully without the crater use of guide legs or lines at all so he annamoe about that please subscribe below
276.87,279.33, and i will show you more
