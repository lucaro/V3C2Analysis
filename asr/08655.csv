1041.15,1100.22, leyis is a traver desirable neighborhood it's on the agitation which is so the transit there the able neighborhood is there and the cities encouraging understandably do encouraging intensification along that line and the clavichord that this is their plan for development on eglinton essentially midroad people basically went to the meetings and basely agreed with that but that plan that concept but what in fact coming in from the development is not this not this continent way way bigger it's not made right it's all development just the amount of development being proposed in the current proposals is something like forty per cent at least is population so that you know traviata and very worrisome
1100.73,1102.2, pretty obvious that
1102.38,1106.64, the focus of development in drama is on the young
1106.64,1168.32, you know the broad young corridor which includes resided there vast walks of the city where verleihen and so a problem is that that what we should be doing is spreading this development across so that there's not an excessive oppression certain songbirds this is where we get intestinalis of change a lot of people want to live in these neighborhoods but they can't afford to so there prisot a face pinions not everybody can live in a single detachment to a transit station but they can live in matrices they can live in town houses they can live in high rises they can live in all kinds of different actions better available that can accommodate families of different sizes and families of different incomes in this of the type of building that we need to be focusing on
1170.69,1214.94, when we moved here o philorthus the area were living in now is was nothing i mean was in or a combination of the fateful and forest and he didn't do townhouse nono a street is full little house the catalog of albeit there no corner coffee shop when you have to drive every where any way you go and i think over time that which what we paralize was missing or what we were looking for so you know humberston in between i still got enough of the suburban tea and nugent that they were for us opingon part will be okay

1293.15,1294.98, come the future growth
1295.22,1299.63, over the jobs are not happening there has been a fundamental shift
1299.84,1309.14, an employment not just in pelegon but in the greater contarini believe in the nation and that shift has been a move away from manufacturing

1315.2,1697.7, we are in a situation to death because of the fact that we've put infrastructure in the ground the residential happen and they paid for their portion of the infrastructure but employment has it happened were in losing manufacturing jobs by the hundreds of thousands of the last ten to fifteen years but were actually gaining jobs in the knowledge and tension in finance and i hate in the in the created economy sectors and those sectors demand the kinds of urban conditions that smart growth that compact communities offer in these are aware the growth blancafort role onesicrates the amortisation thatched ebullition providing places for people to thrive and prosper there that sense of optimism climate change has become a major major factor in all of our thinking so planning to day for environmental sustainable is an absolute requirement we no longer need to be doing our background research and analysis as to whether this matters not what can do step aside the door and we know the planning for climate change planning for adaptation but also insuring that our city in our city regions are more resilient in the future this is not optional it's a required it is now become the centre of our discipline as urban planners the routine now going to be doing whether it's got to do with the building of wilmecote communities compact strong communities transportation of investment in transit that also in economic opportunity because we're going to be changing the procedures of processes in the products that we need in the future in ordeyne's all economic innovation the condition that the growth listing for higher density more mixed communities centipedes isolated that energy and to the plan we need to make sure that the economy that were developing is in tune with nelatha the green the green economy any kind of growth in the twenty first century economic growth jobs an opportunity is going to require first of all that we understand what our requirements are to protect the natural heritage and water courses and wet lands the promised arteriosclerosis tannhaeuser in a little bit of a coterie of subsiding together were incantation till large this amazing set of circumstances to build a more sustainable city more inclusive city to the other side of that for in the road as we come more divided city this is already happening that these the big chunks of our older suburbs continued it to lacerate that we don't create the policies of the financial tools to reinvest the outwitting and i think on this first truncheon laertes is built and of the first leg of the transit plan you're going to find that the elder relationship to the tower neighborhoods that are on the grin suddenly if you're on a transit line there is going to be interesting and aristogeiton space around an old tower actually help cross subsidize fixing up that tower making it ecologically efficient fixing elevators and made nicolette people there when he recognized that the new train the places that we had thought of as being the outskirts the bedroom communities and that those places need the resources they need to development to be the city of the next three million people when i think of the opportunities of hospital fantastic think communities that are connected through transit and really convenient to get to
1698.06,1867.08, so it sort of look at the young line you've got you know young embryonic youngish pard that sort of thing could happen through throughout seasoned on these are existing identity are today is moving day over showed up a morning he widest at the transition to take less than at the time that i did go in for moral next week we start you know back to her and doing a daily and we'll see how much we really love the testing you are worried about was that maybe the people it would be different living in a condoning anybody but honestly if it's really blown some of the stereotypes that i had sense of community and belonging somewhere when i think that that was something that we would feel vingtetunieme transudation intented and what is doing in their building density around all of that rapid transit there building high rises and irises and commercial centers and office centres too one of the cities in the worterleoo by the architecture and all these things in other cities but whatever come back to translate feeling of the justness sense of trust in the sense of well you know the diversities and am always shocked when we go to these great european cities in their undercurrent of those are the others in hesitates exist who meditated and so special and the way that we would lose that is if the drift between the retempered in the portieres who is connected in whose not to get to the point with a becomes animosity and mightier risks is it the change happens and really lespel behind me only way that we can continue to change in a sophisticated way is if we draw in the conversation we bring as many people into a conversation about the future of the city and the future of the region and we build understanding around why changes required and with continually build our own knowledge base around how best to change involves a region to tarascon will really determine our success
