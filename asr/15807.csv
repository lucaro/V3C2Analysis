8.07,18.3, in the chair aberfilly neighborhood networks and have been for a long time and part of what we are trying to do is organize the city by neighborhoods
18.36,59.01, kind of mottled on the political party system of words and visions and what we would like is to get people who are too are organizers interested and educating their neighbors as to the political process especially the philadelphia political process which allowed people to understand and how to be advocates for change both by working on issues and by working through the political process and getting involved in how to get you elected officials to tenatious that the community really feels or important so
60.39,80.19, the last election for or committed people was in thousand in town and happened every four years so in two thousand and six we another progressive organisation occurred people progressive people to run for office and we think that we got about fifty people elected
80.55,86.4, you say officiated person once each
86.4,98.19, each ward or cities divided into wards and each word has two elected are unhatched is evident in divisions
98.52,110.61, very by the geography but approximate dirty divisions forward and each of those has two elected democratic and to elected republican committee people
112.65,140.07, theoretically those people work through the party and help the party come up with decisions about who to support for office and that sort of thing and also provide services to the community tunnelled that determined seated and so we were pleased that we got notify people left but we didn't try to organize this people and the orinoco in in 
140.07,162.57, any particular organized way so to titanite came and we realize even more while was important a progressive people the committee people itineracy working through the party not just outside the party and so lots of people ran and actually in my particular neighborhood i realized
163.17,192.69, about two thousand and eight or seven had no one was doing the job there was no elected committee person and so i can miss a friend in the neighbourhood to a to do it with me and we went to the buttonwood leaders and asked could he be appointed to be committed before an hornibrook and we got no response at all which we took to me that they neither and that they didn't strand we started playing the role
193.17,225.9, anyway i started talking to neighbors you know lots of people always come to me to get advice about how to vote for that sort of thing when i came to two thousand and ten we run and being not a pose when he easily wanted then we go to our first word meeting which we didn't find out about till a day or two before the actual working and what happens is that first word meaning is the officers of the ward are elected
225.96,319.98, will nobody we went to this meeting and no one educated this about the process of what happens it turns out that orford there was opposition to the to the sitting worded and so you know somebody wonderun against him which was causing a lot of dissension and so at the meeting some of us asked if they could enfranchisement about what their bowed and the ward leader said no that we shall read now and didn't let us find out anything more and then there was a big issue the person who was running against the incumbent had been told by numbers of the committee people that if there were an open boat were but does little show of hands that they would not be able to vote for her because they be afraid of if she had won of retaliation and so they really wanted it closed both seemed fair to have a close vote should have to worry bout retaliation anyway so there was a boat on whether it should be opened or closed but the way that it was run not everybody knew exactly what they were voting for and it was sort of shore and guess what one the open shell athanase because it was clear that numbers of people in the room didn't know which way they were voting and now we asked to redhead he went crazy and said absolutely not in stuff and some
320.1,322.59, one of the committee people started sort of
322.92,333.24, now speaking loudly about why it was apportioned it and it went people didn't know what they were voting for in this wasn't a acrasia word later
333.24,376.62, went to the appointed somebody to be a sergeant orbs and basically escorted forced the guy who had elected official lecture committee personal of the room at which point total pandemonium broke perceiving yelling shouting it was just nuts and so finally you know he the border felt obliged to let the guide back in and so he came back in and just it sort of that this was my introduction to the democratic party and a kind of went on you know through my time as the committee person that's what i saw that there was very little democratic process that
376.65,378.99, there were things like there was a 
379.35,383.52, as treasures report given and it was given orally
383.58,391.62, so i asked for copies so we could really think it through and we were told the treasure doesn't want it given out
392.28,414.03, the desertion tooanoowee this is these are our funds that were responsible for and we should be able to see this and so ultimately we were given a one and i don't know i was only a committee person till the end of january because just by coincidence i moved down to the area
414.03,419.01, next january and so on only saw so much but
419.04,429.93, i saw one and so any time there was an effort anything democratic at just
430.29,477.81, happen there was a one point people said so bad he said can't won't we make a list of the committee person people who are in a word with the phone numbers and email addresses so we can contact each other work together and people that acarnanian long tenanted i don't let anybody goshmeelee elected so that you can be contracted by your constituents when you don't give out and and that kind of calais because it's really hard to get access to information about being your committee people are and have a contract them and that's just crazy that's totally against what is supposed to be about
