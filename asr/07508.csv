0.48,18.9, i i'm kendrew with family unfair and i'd like to thank you for taking opportunity to get to know or even a little bit more and ultimately to thank you for volunteering for family fun fer this here this is our first official make a different day events we have been participating for about four or five years now
19.23,107.49, in the past we have invited sharing down connemara one and all of their kites to come out and enjoy in the fun of festivities this year we have invited members of the community and with open the event up to all families that have special needs children so you'll see children that initially have down sinner like living in the past as well as children only autossee and those that are physically handicapped as well families especial means children have a very unique dynamic it's often very difficult for them to go to funen and be out in public because sometimes their children have what we call invisible disabilities meaning that they struggle internally with problems that most typically functioning children don't have and we can't see them for example my daughter has townsend and when you look at her you can see there is something different about her and so it's possible but we hold different expectations for those kids but a family that has a child with something like say autem they may have pretty severe sensory to orders and so you might see a kid the striving to shut down or become worry sun or that unaware i contact and sometimes as as in mother or as a family it harder in public because people can be judgmental and they can be hurtful so we're providing a place where children can come with their families and not feel judges and not feel looked at silly and feel that every one is there to support them but also that it's a very safe environment for precisely the reasons that were providing
108.03,144.78, save as a very serious concern what some of these kids for example my daughter when she was about four or five she would get very excited about going places and she would work herself up to the point where one having arrived she was completely shut down she would be like this and she be rocking is called samminiato and a lot of children in the outset have that personalities type or that trap so you might see that and when you see this or you see a child that flapping their hands against their center sides those are your sigh those are your signs but it's kind of tingitane a step back
144.96,149.22, take your cue from the parents and you know the parents will kind of let you know
149.22,158.97, so continue to engage them if you're trying to talk or try to help her the kind of give you a sign so we're going to ask you to really listen at this spirit on this one and
159.15,179.67, in your heart and your best judgment to know when do engage to help a kite versus back off because primarily the kites on to feel like their very independent this is the place where they get to shine this is a place where they know that they get to take time turn to throw the ball if that's how long it's going to take and they know that if
179.7,189.27, do their very best and they still don't knock over the cans or get the bean bag in the hole that since they did their best to put at a price
189.93,211.08, another very serious concern that most families that have special news children whether that's cognitive impairment or physical impairment is what we call a slight risk child i experienced it myself and even though my older daughter is almost fifteen his till a slight risk child and that means that they don't have the same stranger in danger
211.08,218.88, sparks into a child's head when somebody comes and starts talking to them they don't all have that i'm going to hide behind my mom your daddy's leg
218.91,293.13, oh that's a nice person and their talking to me or if he think i was call it like my my daughter with grey hound dogs that they seem to bunnybury she wants to go to the bunny and then it's a see the clown in one of beacon a look the gate open and it happened that fast and that after speaking with the parents that are coming to the event that's their biggest concern is it is a large open field there's a lot of activity and if they don't have the kiotsaton and sensory they likely have a slight risk child which means that you like that they might be out so if that we have an emergency planning place that's very similar to those that the school system is use all of our volunteers are going to be wearing gray chartreuse green vest were not going to miss as you're going to be able to see us a mellow and there's going to be a limetree fifteen seventy volunteers at any given point in these rest so we think of the size of a ballfield of soft ball field you probably not going to be more than about fifteen or twenty feet away from another volunteer any point so if you see a child and they look like they're in distress and they don't have a family member around them were even a child that doesn't have a family member around them your job especially our ambassadors your job is to have half eyes on those kids
293.19,302.1, watch observe make sure that there's somebody watching them make sure that they're not kind of willy nilly about by themselves because you don't know if this is one of the typical
302.13,314.85, siblings that there or if this is the child that has special needs and has escaped from their parents so in the tent you see a kettle masnieres in distress or if they seem to be alone
315.15,323.34, and the roaches how they respond to you what if it's no contact and not going to look at you you might have a kid of anisette support
324.27,364.44, the plan is to shout out to one of the other charioteers it's it's a code green if you find a kid and there alone give him but ten seconds to observe and at that point after ten seconds it's code green shout out to the other person if you're one of those other people you hear the coterie come orating we want to have at least two volunteers with that child prior to sending out what's going to be a map a mass the message at the bottom of this screen right here you see my name candor there is a phone number next to it sixty three seven three four six one six seven right now i want you to send me a tack
364.5,374.91, your name so that i can add janitor mass tax list because that's the last organs in the event that we find one of these kids and they can't find their parents
374.97,377.37, every one and that entire
377.61,397.38, event is going to have that information in about three seconds at that point we had our security involved and we take over the microphone from the band and lester looking for the parents so clearly if we have a lost child that means we have lost parents and siblings if parents approach you have the panic face
397.47,406.2, take the time to find another volunteer your first job is to send out that code green text business soon as possible at the number below
406.23,422.01, blanket the entire community of volunteers or security offers is going to be notified and we are going to block the former meaning that we almost a formal little circle it sounds a literati but but i can do no have lost it
422.28,433.5, we have the entrance watched and the individuals that are monitoring the parking lots that the one out there thayving the flash light as far as finding a parking spots they're going to checking cars
433.56,441.09, it is that it is a serious i hope we don't have to use this plan but if we do we're going to be very grateful that it's in place
441.12,443.76, if you have the parents once again
443.94,450.36, next message i take everyone else we locked on the perimeter and we start watching the cars and tell that kiopo
450.39,453.18, you heard me bring up sensory kids
453.21,465.93, i heard that term before but that means is that i coordinates it happens with adults and we have invited adolescence to this event as well is that the way they process
466.02,467.07, sound
467.4,470.34, no lights even touch
470.58,478.41, he completely different than how you and i experienced those sensations in fact in the visual with hauism will have a hard time
478.41,480.39, taking the entirety of a picture
480.75,482.73, drawing information from it
483.06,498.09, may focus on just the wheel of a car and they can tell you about the deal when you say what is this a focusing on the wheel they can't always tell you it's a car if they were and try to process all of this stimulant is coming in at the same time they get
498.12,510.03, overburdened and they can be in the shut down that's what we're trying to avoid and in fact between the hours of five and five forty five a gintleman what we call sensory or so in that time
510.42,528.0, everyone to be cognizant that between five and forty is sensory hour that that when we're most likely going to have individuals that are on the antiserum so there are the cats that if you look at it seems like there struggling with the game if you approach them they may not talk to you
528.03,539.13, they may not seem to want your help but as long as the parents are giving you those cute it's okay to verbally prompt them as far as what they might want to adjust
539.13,548.13, a little harder you're doing a good job they can still hear you they are still processing what you're saying you just might not see the effects of that communication
548.25,571.98, if however they seem to stress by that communication it's okay to just take a step to the side again following their parents curse as the parents are ultimately whose entire of helping them that day where mostly there is support the parents but we want to make sure the kids are having a good experience so providing that positive feedback still giving them a yesterday five there still just kellie the rest of her kids
572.79,594.6, primarily the only thing that we will be altering during the century or is going to be that instead of having her life and music going to be playing soft busy music in the background so i'll still be a fun carnival experience but that bombardment of sound that can really not help our kids that's going to be removed so that bacon focus instead of
594.6,605.4, different centuries at the same time they can focus on just what's happening in front of them whether it's the game or whether it's the hair painting without tryin to also process that stimuli
605.82,625.11, in the event that an hour cotoner break they are absolutely welcome to any of the primary rooms inside of the church building as well as we will have a small area kind of towards the back of the field where a picnic type set up is going to be appropriate where parents have brought blankets their welcome to spread out
626.94,650.58, the children in adolescence that have more physical impairments if they are still in a diaper or depend they are absolutely welcome to use any of the private rooms inside of the church building will have a couple of the primary rooms locked of specific to that event so for those of you that are watching the bathrooms or if you're inside
650.64,666.09, on the security duty just now that there may be parents that require a private place to change their children because of course the bathroom floor is not really appropriate not a lot of privacy with the big gap in its also very cold
667.05,678.51, do have some individuals that are coming this year that will have their seeing ye dogs in the event that the dogs needed linklater you're more than walking i peste dog to approach and
678.54,688.68, of course as the owner handler if they need a drink for a town to give the snap and that's entirely appropriate as long as your asking first just as if you were trying to
688.83,691.8, noisesome ody's kiyo want to make sure it's okay
692.1,712.56, for those i speak siliquae and going to ask you to please let me know that in the text mess that you sent me earlier if you just want to give your name and that you are proficient in even if you just now some of the more basic signs that could still be very helpful for example things you might want to know a case your approach by a kite is
