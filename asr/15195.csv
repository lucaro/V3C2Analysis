0.27,4.71, i'm darn vane owner and creator of creature craft rescue craft
4.74,8.49, i'm here to talk to you about an ever present danger in our community
8.7,18.06, down the low head dam is the least expensive and therefore the most common dam in the world there are literally thousands of them scattered throughout this country
18.6,21.84, many of them look fairly innocuous
22.23,24.96, many people voluntarily get into them
25.2,37.89, a low head dam is called a drowning machine victims are able to survive for relatively long periods of time sometimes in excessive an hour while in the dam
37.89,44.34, water craft in the world that is capable of entering and exciting safely in a low head down
44.34,53.01, provides a safe platform that minimizes the risk to rescue personnel while greatly increasing the odds of rescuing an live victim
54.03,59.16, i have been building in designing the creature craft for over years
59.16,105.72, these boats were originally designed to safely run extreme white water and toni was approached by rescue professional who inquired about the ability of these boats to perform to haddam rescue at that point we began changing the designs of bit to suit that need and now we have a boat that is the only safe boat in a low head down the cracraft rescue system involves to rescue personnel one the actual rescue or in the front of the boat and the other the driver is mounted in the middle of the book one of the most important features of a creature crabtree craft is one that it is in the extremely stable platform
105.9,135.66, very difficult to ever turn on its side however if it does turn on its side it is a very simple process for turn it right side up and can be taught in a matter of a few hours it is a simple method of weight transfer with both the rescuer and the driver working together another advantage of the creature craft rescue system is that the boat can be launched from above the dam and run over the dam and then perform a rescue
135.99,139.35, can be also launched from below the dam
