43.92,89.49, letters and more like shapes because i think can lettering you can you don't have to follow the rules as exactly as some one who is filicaia because they need to know the ins and outs of each letter and how it should interact with the base line where his letters the more kind of lapithae character so it's kind of hard for me to think of it so technically because i do think i work more like an illustrator and that way not sayornis starting my design projects i felt like i couldn't really do the really slick design so when i started
89.55,94.29, operating illustration and to my projects they came more naturally
94.5,102.24, i went to a sketch for a long or something in that line just draw it just like that like that fellow i don't

173.04,176.76, around the beginning of where lettering kind of really took off
178.08,186.39, i gather most my inspiration specifically take reference from thunderous
186.42,190.77, any thing that has really a nice type on it i'll pick it up
191.13,194.1, i study it now i can
194.19,198.45, remember it and when i draw it's kind of it has my own take on it
198.51,203.64, not reverencing it so directly so i'm kind of injecting my own personality into it
