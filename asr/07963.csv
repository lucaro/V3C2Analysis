1.95,98.52, i think for many years the environmental movement is assumed if you want to get people to do something if you engage people a sickly what you have to do is to make us sufficiently depressing film or right as efficiently hundred fertiliser able leader and get it into their hands and they read and my god that terrible i'll go passaconaway it doesn't work in that you know you can appelaient stages of change so there are the people who are the just about ready to make a change that contorting and they want to make a change of estanquet doneraile in colorado but i'm not really at some point may be in a while blossoming about it and there's a people who just probable or public the last couple of her years have been absolutely unprecedented in all of human history course our population has grown from under a billion toontooni natural resources both on absolute basis and also a precarious had gone normously but driving this enormous change in terms of you know intending
98.61,107.37, years ago we gained access to an enormous treasure trove of cheap concentrated energy in the form of coal
107.37,110.61, and natural gas 
110.61,131.82, having this energy enabled us to do all these other things we invented automobiles and airplanes so that we could use the enormous treasure of resources to transport ourselves and transport our goods ever further distances and so on we the whole modern world on
131.85,156.3, coal and natural gas before we were using some light indirectly as a king through gold plans and we had the plants to
156.3,162.6, horses and oxen and so on and then use their muscle power to do things but with
162.66,176.19, fossil fuels we have energy sources but were created by nature over the course of millions of years tens of millions of years and we don't have to put any effort into making
176.25,191.85, fuel all we've had to do is indigent of the ground our lives there completely predicated on the availability of cheapness point to an extent that we really can't understand
192.09,206.04, we tend to think that anything we've lived with for more than a couple of years is normal and this has been going on for hundreds of years certainly for last several decades and increasing intensification but really over the last couple of hundred years
206.16,239.55, we started relying on fossil fuels to a great extent teetotalers also the problem of these are not renewable resources which means that gradually were were running out it's not that we're going to run out completely any time soon therese
239.67,247.08, enormous amounts of coal oil and natural gas in the ground but we've extracted them using the low hanging fruit
248.34,255.42, initially we extracted the highest quality musest access
255.66,262.77, sure and we left the dirty hard to get more expensive stuff for later
263.31,283.08, what its later with people we reach a situation where we can't continue to grow the economy in the way that we have for the past few decades because the economy depends on transportation
283.47,285.75, we grow transportation
286.11,288.48, then we can't grow the economy
288.69,313.53, in the situation where loss of what we have built a lot of where we have placed our resources is going to prove to have been a complete waste of money because it won't function without cheap energy and cheap credit so we have growth being constrained both by limits in less in resources and also by limits
313.86,370.5, the environments ability to absorb the waste of our industrial production system at some point theoretically that results in an end of world economic growth now i believe that we reached that point actually intends going to attainment
370.59,375.57, activities for schools anyway so it we hear my 
375.57,381.21, school day wasn't a day off but he said outstaring
381.3,413.16, and even though we still see residual growth in a few economies around the world such as china most of the expansion that we've seen in the us and europe since two thousand eight has been not an a result of increasing consumption and investment such as we saw in previous decades it's been entirely due to government and central banks pumping enormous amounts of capital into
413.34,420.27, economy in the form of stimulus packages and bayous take away the
420.27,428.22, several trillion dollars worth of stimulus and blots and there has been no economic growth since the
428.73,441.69, this suggests to me that we have reached the proverbial limits to growth in my programme to discourage coal
443.55,453.15, i want to be alone at the moment ungerminating if any just take her that appeasable it really beaten
453.39,457.44, when i'm dancing in fact it is very much to foresee
457.47,460.83, couldn't think about anything else you think about
461.28,476.28, the anointing that need don't anticipate again i don't think into the future you anticipate them things will go wrong and you don't think about what you were doing previously otherwise things will still go wrong so i think islettes a very
476.49,511.44, and then to be almost a baked ability for meditation of patients that if you are very much on the moment a coatless technology to do the same thing to delay to delay crisis but as in economics when you used technology to delay ecological crisis you you antithesis that went when it eventually come and this is all based on the idea that you can grow forever that you can have an infinite growth on the file
511.74,522.48, he took absolute mess humanities into de and it symbolized in these multiplied
523.5,534.66, of the crisis in its fear feet on each other in a positive feedback so when you have none sustainable economies based on green alone and maiming returns
535.02,536.46, investors
536.61,539.58, you also then build the culture
539.94,541.32, not very
541.53,545.82, those who are disenfranchised or caring because they can't
546.3,557.91, those who have the post of caring only bother about me in riven by greed and when you have too much concentration of economic power
557.91,596.94, you have that concentration starting to influence political power and leads to a structure change in the way we governesses instead of being democracies the people of the people for the people it ends of being by the corporation for the operations of the corporation and we see the emergence of a corporate state i started singing and about ninety one maenalian says congealing where is amorites then i did commences but in aptenodytes business side of it golong with it
597.18,598.05, he
598.47,628.14, but actually saying you know i am forming in all that in brimstone even though by singing not all even also i was a kid right books as you did like one and ortolans very quiet message saying could not at all about table aanyway with the dinner and hipparion and gave forth food on the table to young holding in matters really good as by a team that infantine some beer that was under my art or thorntree
629.1,635.91, in books follerin the process of toilet i belmore success than making
636.0,676.02, if you also look at the tragedies of poverty and hunger one billion people are going without food not because the earth could not produce enough for them but because an industrial system has to wrong the soil of food as the rob communities that produce food of food half of the hungry people of the world to day appointed because the system as sack every grain out to saltan half of it goes to feed animals were then tortured large part is going for by a few in an absolutely insinuations
676.74,680.01, destroying your primary asset
681.33,682.89, to generate wealth
682.95,684.75, it doesn't make any sense
684.9,691.98, so really we are talking about a challenge capitalism and i think that has need to be said and sometimes i think we talk about growth
691.98,762.03, so that we don't have to talk about capitalism that it's easier in some ways to talk about growth and it is to talk about capitalism and that seen as many to left wing but i do think we have to talk about the economic system that demands that and less gross and that has added an ecological expansion that has created the cristianissimo
762.27,768.09, wollaston years i've been a lesser
768.24,774.51, i really don't look to the top level of political organization for solution at all because
774.51,818.07, the level is peopled by the very people who have been the most significant beneficiaries of the status quo and they have tremendous vested interests in that state is quite they're the people reality to change anything plus they tend to be very reactive not very practice so they are looking backwards and extrapolating trans forward they don't see trend changes coming and they don't act in a timely fashion so even if there were things that they could do i don't think they would be doing them i think they would be trying to look into the same bag of tricks to do just more of the same and as i stand said doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity
818.55,823.32, the man in the toilettes of woman is a midnight only
823.47,826.32, that you know when there is no option
826.56,828.03, i think that's what i
828.03,843.09, change the tune was the alamance essence assistant valtrauta without rotolos as disengaged and eliminated exclusion
843.27,846.33, cities a system like that
846.66,854.52, standing hesitatingly condensers but the figures not sustainable colonial towns
854.55,864.03, so missus temiscouata i want to carry on doing what i'm doing as long as i can because i enjoy what i do
865.14,868.62, the same time i have a growing awareness that
869.1,873.27, all of the things that i do and others do are going to be possible
874.53,880.68, point neuraline or where that line come the moment i don't know
880.74,884.01, working days a week
884.19,895.86, then i don't want to spend my evenings being involved heavily and something else at all so i am i'm in my nothing at lettering there
896.46,911.22, we simply obviously unjust only what the future is ten years ago i would have had it all clear and mattoon know what ten years is going to be like i think there are two key
911.7,921.66, mistakes if you like in the way we were as a train to see the world since childhood through our schooling system and are adduction system one is that we humans
921.75,923.73, i separate from nature
923.76,925.77, the superior to nature
926.22,928.17, and that we can
928.23,931.26, the whole of nature is there for us to exploit
932.07,936.21, and also that it an infinite set of resources
936.54,946.11, that we can explore that limit so that's one little to the package the other one is that we see the whole world a dead machine
946.92,973.29, that has no intrinsic value at all is only valuable or bits of it any valuable in a can extract them from wild nature and convert them into products which can themison the market place then nat has value but it has no value if it's just being matured by itself doing a thing in it has no value at all in nature the natural world tina infrastructure it's alive
973.95,978.66, and it wants to do everything in its power
982.65,984.93, antipode
986.85,988.5, everything we do
988.83,992.34, with technology which is static
994.53,997.08, quite dumb
997.77,1002.09, and as a certain thing has a certain technical brains that
1003.02,1007.61, that's required to create it in the first place but when you when you look at a comparatively
1007.76,1010.28, i and nature
1010.43,1020.72, it's a really bad imitation to really poor imitation doleman contains my anglaises goetic so he
1021.02,1037.22, count had this conversation he depends upon a society being able to make be maintained as he is so he is a saving reticences together personally my biggest peripatetic it contain and things need till almost go back
1037.22,1048.59, antisepsis or way of living for bodymaster lie on the other hand if that was to happen in a chance of my son's originalite minimal
1050.99,1062.3, conrad you know they both like to go and have children what kind of innovator is there for the seas were re me when one ionic as that would make the earth makes us
1062.69,1065.78, and the most important link between
1065.87,1095.9, the earth and bodies is the food that the earth gives us then for of course as the bigonia in brain features are and carry
1098.27,1105.92, there i am i'm contented for types of peas so but she a snap in oropus and normal peace
1106.01,1107.33, he
1107.42,1108.74, he
1109.7,1111.2, we go forward
1111.23,1113.42, besides how he distributed
1113.6,1137.15, if he grow in the fossil fields and the fossil fields come in particular places fertilize a factories in particular places there already essentialized control and when agricola the industrial systems then a centralized impositum also get killing to a centralized distribution system and you get the old man the same berries the test goes controlling the food chain a
1137.27,1158.3, fame as well as cheating consumers at the same time eating there are many people here who would
1158.84,1161.6, right out uninterfered 
1161.6,1163.85, i mean even i felt that
1163.94,1165.32, long time
1165.74,1172.82, animate two or three years i thought this is where i want to be this is what i want to do this is what my life was going
1173.09,1175.97, then again
1176.12,1186.38, waking up to me to realize that all i was putting the salt they are thin kid this is also part in my prices but i'm going streamlining
1187.19,1189.77, standing in the way of my doing things
1189.92,1191.45, my 
1191.69,1193.82, as
1193.82,1199.79, moving the urge to do things and i think one of the
1199.85,1202.79, the hottest thing is in perfecting round
1202.88,1211.37, anticipation by the afternoon doering that you can do and you are going to leave it
1211.79,1215.33, said i like my job but 
1216.83,1238.01, the old thing i work in water to live on living to work that not a balance the bad always get right on adamantine standing animal care and looking at universities and a destined in any age
1238.49,1253.1, we have the illusion that intensely produce food is cheap when in practice really expensive for the environment but what we're doing is treating earth capital as if it was income and that's what
1253.22,1268.1, as happened with all our food system for about the last fifty or sixty years really since the war we've been consuming the accumulated resources of our mother planet which would be laid down over millions and millions of years
1268.16,1272.78, replenishing them and pretending that this will go on for ever
1273.08,1283.55, the process is that made me start thinking about change really came into the ring when i started trying to grow my own feet 
1283.7,1297.8, the challenges were effaced and how he got lointain everything and hoping and thinking and burn something else comes along and he it will i and is all very much a meaning experience
1300.56,1318.74, easy when you live in a city and you buy food at the supermarket or you've got a restaurant and the food peers and it just seems as if it's just going to keep on coming and since people who live in bannister physically disconnected from agriculture or word would they know
1318.86,1322.94, but this fragility unless action is taken
1323.0,1330.11, to address climate change resource to petion the world's growing population
1330.14,1334.76, it was shrinking land area and is taken in
1334.76,1336.32, tremendous hurry
1336.32,1342.35, we could be facing a global food crisis within the next appears
1343.79,1353.54, well like a lot of other people are gone an awareness that things are impure precarious state they the world is working
1354.2,1358.94, and i think it very important that we start the great feed so started grew food
1359.0,1360.86, in looking to
1361.01,1366.14, that will help me to get food and saw this hole just on the road which i could sit
1366.77,1371.0, and so i just applied to that and to saigon a bit extra nolledge on
1371.9,1376.16, housing to produce and really we
1376.55,1390.38, no need to come out and so it salernitano do i like the end of the tenor i've got me insane being vegetable self sufficient argolander with trinacrian to cabbages will holston
1390.44,1394.43, like attacking that here my dear
1399.05,1407.69, toby the word that word sustain ability most people just associate with some kind of ethical
1408.11,1418.88, or moral ideal you know we want to be more sustainable for the sake of the generation in the future and that's a good thing i mean really is
1419.12,1422.57, the be the foundation of our collective
1422.66,1425.03, but
1425.3,1434.36, gotten beyond that it's to the point now where doing things that are sustainable or not just ethical they are necessary for our survival
1434.48,1506.15, you goesta rant and the oars and in a semicircle to make sure that i can survive certainly cementation that required a created the first presented look at a comparatively to what you find in an indeterminate much great feebleness inimitably fortifications from restaurants and the pancreatic and so you get me safe and we onderful antoinette moderation something otherwise he just like starkweather
1506.45,1508.1, made me realize
1508.4,1513.86, well i was thinking is father is more than i was even thinking
1513.95,1516.65, in terms of worrying me
1517.88,1519.98, i was reared
1520.07,1522.29, yeah i was raymond
1522.38,1534.29, i feel that the moment i get bit overwhelmed because i feel like in one person and that the heart that are a hard thing when you feel like you passionality on doting together
1534.38,1552.41, to me maybe came through i thought we wouldn't it be wonderful if we were all in this together and she feeling that together and going through it so seeing people that putting them blood sweat and tears in touching on what that's going on how we can fix it and how much time we have have and
1552.56,1558.65, seeing them saying o people to know tis like i want you to help me and help me put the soul
1558.74,1560.21, a more
1560.6,1562.82, so i think that
1562.91,1563.93, it
1563.99,1569.21, from these people are being on the news or a minister makes it makes such a difference
1569.27,1580.43, every day sometimes you have sometimes you down and after what incognita and up there's the positive side of things yet we we've got a big change coming
1581.0,1591.2, it's not a disaster its opportunity and the more we comparing that more confident i can feel about it the more i can become engaged in the opportunity
1591.62,1596.09, if we think about how we get off this disastrous
1596.18,1611.69, conan ecological path which is really it's really the same crisis different sides of the same crisis than we have to believe that we have a pass and also that we have a future that we are in the sort of perpetual adolescent presence
1611.81,1615.77, where we never have to deal with the effects of our actions
1615.83,1621.53, as to many people out there for whom the food system is the supermarket
1622.52,1623.48, if
1623.54,1632.0, there thinking then to say that there will come a time when there's not no orator expensive oil and that has a lock on the fact
1632.24,1634.46, the justice in the collection there
1634.97,1642.47, i think is an area that is going to have to be explored and expanded so much more long and
1643.1,1659.0, i can however compliment information borosay forward tradition aventine the many was part of the polenta sort of information needs to be taken out there are degraded
1659.21,1662.06, it is a key keenly
1662.06,1687.08, and so my senses that we can eat and look at that as the disaster and that something dreadful and i something that we need to bury a head in the sand of believing that economic growth will somehow be pulled out the fire motilal to have more more stuff forever and ever ever or we can consciously and compassionately and creatively 
1687.38,1693.11, design where we go from here and re think many of the things that we've come to take for granted
1693.14,1717.77, we can learn how to be saved if we can learn how to even say we have too much then does create space for some growth for forgot that estate place and parts of the world that have been the places where we have extracted the wealth and left a little behind because a vedete happen and i think a lot of the discussion around to end of growth
1717.83,1719.21, to treat
1719.27,1724.85, old as it is the same and it's not the same there places that need to grow and their places that need to
1725.06,1727.37, growing and even contract
1728.63,1747.02, a very difficult thing to discuss this publicly because in a way people expect the language to be used in the at the science based decision making framework to be absolutely connected to the current paradigm and yet i think we are on the threshold of paradise shift
1748.16,1759.2, a most important things moving that knowledge moving that individual attention to actually accepting what's going to happen that's the forester and that takes
1759.2,1762.17, powers otherwise his panic
1763.52,1765.86, he was saying we don't need to panic
1766.01,1767.3, plan
1767.9,1780.44, we don't need to panic as for hope for her and the circumstances where you could panic i think there is a great need to encourage every body
1780.53,1791.72, in transition while the hen to be in expectation which is what we had for the last ten years this feeling that i have a right to have
1791.84,1797.24, indicative i want when i want it
1797.63,1804.56, i grew up and that's not how we going to pondering in tentative and i think the sooner
1804.8,1807.89, comes to a realization of that
1808.28,1818.6, then the easy which is going to be to live in that new world last my lifestyle presto change taught what you've grown up with
1819.41,1821.81, but seeing that it can work and
1822.2,1823.46, you can
1825.59,1828.38, enjoying a life like that is
1829.13,1831.41, treadmore
1831.62,1838.55, can be the change you can take individual action is a citizen and your action at a local level
1838.58,1853.64, family in your household and your community and then flyin the world can actually deliver the change and we don't have to wait for politicians and actually at as i look like it if we start first of all
1853.73,1874.34, imagine where we want to be going and see that as something that we all get excited about the results for people that they think as actually that's the color will i like to wake up in years time difficult to say we've got this top satire needs to make it made
1875.12,1879.14, we have seen it and approach from both sides because
1879.89,1890.03, i think there are probably a lot of people who feel like this is something they like to be able to do they may be like betook pastime were part time doing growing their own food
1890.09,1901.64, the community but because of financial restrictions and responsibilities whether it be that they got a mortgage they've got family to look after em they feel locked into
1901.7,1913.67, to carrying on doing what they already doing were waited dependency on one just even if he's just now and yourself foamed at family and that tennelly spreads out so possibly nabors
1914.24,1918.26, a kind of having impact on people and they in like tricks well
1918.29,1926.63, from that point you know said in around waiting for government and been corporations and whatever they're not going to they're milk as much as they can for on as they can
1926.93,1942.2, what traditions about release is about designing for resilience which is the ability of the settlement to where the shock from the outside when it encounters that shock i guess the idea realisation
1942.26,1944.87, you had something that might shift her
1945.11,1947.33, the next next him
1947.48,1955.61, all to such to be such that you can stabilize around your point allocution such that you can
1955.64,1957.14, work on
1957.38,1967.13, say you're not getting something that's going crazy just because one little pet ovation to send it off something that you want your sister to be able to adapt to
1967.16,1969.38, bessie to
1969.5,1974.06, maintain its function despite an imposition of a change
1974.57,1987.8, and we know in science that the more biders have in any consistent the more asininities over all we will need to have a lot of wild land but to help regulate the climate
1988.01,1999.83, not just land also ocean systems undisturbed ocean systems incredibly important for taking carbonate of the atmosphere so lots of places that are not disturbed
2000.01,2031.45, very important that's not to say that we can't entertain do some harvesting of course we will be able to do that but we have to do it in very very carefully that means we're going to have to find ways of green food on the land that we do have now for avonturn new ways that are quite intensive but not intensive in conventional chemical sense more intense in esperance protester interesting opportunity to to to take the very different
2031.6,2034.84, a very different approach a different way of
2035.08,2038.44, in the world being in the world
2038.5,2044.65, then as if you you know how you know how the natural reproduce things and what it means
2044.65,2047.35, put those pieces together in a manner
2047.56,2052.78, last best that each of those components has to offer
2053.17,2054.88, and
2056.38,2062.41, you have you have a pretty potent tool and not only being able to supply for your needs
2062.41,2064.18, that in relation to
2064.24,2066.67, to producing food
2066.76,2069.82, if you live in a place that has
2069.82,2071.53, madame
2071.53,2077.86, being able to rehabilitate the landscape so it becomes useful to you you now gaining mutual benefit
2078.19,2083.59, it think whole systems natural design or whole systems design in general is about
2083.77,2090.34, in ways in which all of the pieces that are in the system can gain mutual benefit and unfortunately right now
2090.88,2094.3, the way the way the world is arranged
2094.45,2096.01, father from that
2096.52,2098.05, you know we
2099.07,2100.69, we have
2101.05,2103.12, we register that
2103.54,2104.86, technically
2104.98,2106.18, impressive
2106.66,2108.46, statically
2108.55,2110.17, completely bankrupt
2111.04,2121.0, of course here i stand said becoming within a limit from monopolies the sense of wotan to return to
2121.0,2127.27, always after so tinting things as they were or is it about moving to new states
2127.45,2131.44, blythesome where were
2131.62,2138.88, i think in the sense of a concern is about maintaining the current system residence concerning to economize
2139.54,2152.83, need is what have gone up democracy recognizing that we sitizens of the earth therefore the issue of grounding ourselves on so in building economies of the soil which means both
2152.95,2163.15, in that life one anathemas important thing not the fossil field that lies very underneath the economies of the soil giving par
2163.42,2165.46, people on the ground
2165.79,2186.58, so separating the decisions about economic affairs people start changing the way they consumed produce and this changes the country changes the culture of peoples relationship with the earth the dalcoath but it also changes the control people amongst themselves when you are in a globule economy daventree
2187.0,2226.66, you to become part of the culture of greed you pentateuch of fear you become part of the culture of compotation once he building local economies based in sustain ability you become part of a cotton corporation with mature and amongst the girl is not
2227.35,2235.18, senatorial ical way well to change the biggest saturnalia pictures
2235.24,2239.11, this discussion there's been discussion and
2239.17,2242.11, in the choice and the government
2242.38,2251.59, about basically cutting off a third of the city to a municipal services because they now orations to be able to maintain the infrastructure
2251.86,2252.82, so
2254.86,2260.5, i have a lot of land is not is not getting us so some people are just going out to claiming for themselves
2260.53,2275.29, in some cases the city is giving yapple to be able to end very lucky up here on the side of a hill looking down on topless they got this land about two years ago to turn into a lotment
2275.65,2282.88, this is the second year growing and we were very lucky to get hold of one in april of this year
2282.94,2289.75, what we have here is a piece of land a measure piece of land and an explanation piece of land
2289.96,2294.52, one community by an association the latent association
2294.7,2305.11, an annual and the advantage that we've got although it's not our land and as long as we cultivate it then we have it for life
2305.65,2310.99, we moved away then the next person comes in and they make a promise to cultivate it
2311.11,2313.66, they cultivated they've got it for life
2313.84,2314.8, he
2315.28,2317.14, he
2317.65,2319.54, the point is
2319.99,2322.96, rathenau has
2323.05,2326.29, absorbing garden decide from the atmosphere
2326.98,2329.02, the creation of living a
2329.41,2342.43, lance take the sunlight the garofoli three foot of sesterces takes the capitaine out of the air and releases oxygen that we need and thus cleans up
2342.76,2346.48, constantly giving us our withered
2347.35,2372.97, that living carbon needs to be maximized in order to deal with climate change brought in mitigating it as well as another petition in mitigation the more green you have on the planet the more absorption out of the atmosphere stating place and the more placable to absorb carbon laid out of the atmosphere the more carbon the able to return to the soul so the soul ends up being the biggest sink
2373.09,2376.27, but the count rich soil
2376.42,2378.28, at
2378.37,2388.12, give us my food it's also a more resilient soil because it can hold ten to twenty times more moisture then a carbon depleted saw her
2388.18,2411.61, as a result of which in a drought comes began to with it when a flood comes the soul was as absorbed more of the moisture and therefore make the impact of flatness no matter which were you look at it maximin living carbon is vital as a climate solution and is right as a food solution i think it is time to recognize that life is come
2412.42,2428.14, toast everybody talking about the corporations and try to sequester poverino whatever and people driving for the lotharian i think it's a wonderful way to think about it and that we won't live in cabinet we were life and
2428.23,2430.39, and i think
2430.6,2435.07, a wonderful way to see everything working together again it's not just
2435.25,2437.32, and the environment is
2437.62,2440.08, constant connection between his
2440.32,2455.11, and i think of necessity we will re discover community and we will discover that that's actually very valuable things at of the challenge but we have over the next ten years isabel
2455.53,2457.93, entreat each other again
2458.29,2462.67, because one of the side effects of the oil age the age of cheap energy
2462.94,2498.34, been the reality that you can live on a street and not know anybody on that street which is a very dubious luxury really only of the last years communities always the pandion each other and medeah other in support of each other and mutually dependent but we've been able to just do away with that completely and i think that coming back together again and re learning how to engage with each other and to work with each other and especialy to each other and cooperate is something which will be tricky for some and but hugely beneficial thing
2499.63,2527.8, the only way of getting any one who's in a negative kind of atmosphere in violent or frame of mind into a more positive walrabe unless in king to say me that idealised those into the deepest and try and get into some kind of volunteer for some kind of community base
2528.34,2532.84, organization because it's not only about kind of
2532.84,2535.15, the free we as
2535.15,2538.15, really about working with people
2538.48,2548.26, and his people your own boat but people in the same state and in the same way and you in work with each other unconsciously
2548.65,2550.66, into this positive
2550.75,2578.08, indeed know the specific i'm open to the possibilities where it actually goes what i'm going to do to morrow i don't know what i'm going to do next week i don't know what i do know
2578.14,2596.32, is that i mean to do other things we are led to do a thing we all need to do what the things together quite how it works yet i don't know but i am ready to take steps with direction to walk in this war i think the thing about critical asses
2596.35,2609.94, his grace so can start being how it is working and how you're not just going saying why and gentle everything and just hope that if she does going to happen when you start to see people doing it and living it
2609.97,2613.3, in about something i want to be passed
2613.51,2629.74, it seems to me that the ecological crisis is also a crisis of meaning and of being and it has its sort of spiritual counterpart if we go to encourage millions of people to go on this journey it has to feel like a journey toward something where
2629.77,2636.04, we put in the place of this materialistic age and we've been caswell feel actually better
2636.07,2648.73, terms of quality of life and related to the mist of planet and what comes in the place of what were giving up will make make as feel that we've actually traded up rotondo
2648.79,2659.02, i mean i dearly very much in a big transition period where i don't know where i'm going leathering lots of ideas for it in by my head and i think
2659.29,2663.64, partly just trying i'm not being afraid
2663.91,2666.58, for all
2667.06,2669.64, in some respects i feel like one
2669.64,2671.41, had to go quite far in
2671.59,2680.47, a room boutonniere direction before i realized which one i want to go in and out at that will happen again as in making more transitions in
2680.68,2683.14, thinking how to manage
2683.5,2690.1, shift our world in so that we could really connect with the magnificence of videret
2690.25,2693.13, the miracle that there's any life at all
2693.13,2696.37, ordinary wonder of a tree
2696.37,2697.42, but
2697.72,2705.64, even greater wonder of the relationships in each other then will have the right wolvercote a truly sustainable world
2705.94,2709.06, that's where the spiritual dimension if you like
2710.62,2713.62, and by diversity comes in
2714.34,2732.34, the truth is we don't know whether our actions or our collective actions can make the changes in the time but we have the responsibility to act whether or not her successful and in that respect i'm optimistic because i believe that that is a
2733.36,2736.87, the responsibility and therefore if we act
2736.9,2738.25, we can do
2738.43,2740.59, if enough of the sight then we can
2740.74,2748.48, i like i was by prince a pride antonino what it was that unlocked
2748.9,2755.05, the favorite who say it became my experience and it became
2755.14,2760.66, just as something is an actual testimony should be something became a well
2761.05,2763.51, sitting in a
2764.38,2765.7, the same way that
2766.03,2767.89, about
2767.95,2770.32, calicat
2771.46,2772.78, at
2773.17,2774.46, makes us
2774.91,2776.2, she had us
2776.29,2778.99, and i leave me the earth doric
2779.44,2787.99, that makes a body stocking in my view advocates the taking care of the earth
2788.83,2791.26, we form in the right way
2791.89,2793.99, we of the
2794.68,2816.01, you can have a caretaker and that is the mirabel as human beings so for any society say to say we need less galician careless in his functions i have been thinking reasoning that every one comes in beila themselves some way
2816.07,2818.38, whether it was a pond
2818.38,2830.05, music is there's never any silence anywhere every with a noise even now i can have cars by five bases but no one ever sat down and he thinks
2830.23,2833.86, this is why am i do i want to be
2834.01,2835.33, and what
2835.39,2836.8, to do
2836.89,2841.54, not just for anyone why missus fictive one
2843.16,2844.45, distinct
2845.29,2853.51, going on and i think it comes to you like i just arnaldo i think that if you sit down and listen
2855.76,2911.29, he can he
