112.59,117.09, national time to make sure that they
118.35,146.73, thus going to have time as rachel made a big three right before that and we came down and got a thought topically rap before half we may make a big shot they come down and make thorough and it goes in though i think you know we went in with the momentum and you know i just we just said we know we wanted to adjust them something of it the press breaker we wanted to make some adjustments with that and that was basically it we said just keep defensively he locking down what you're doing and offensively keep movin the ball think we ended up with

197.76,222.0, we came out we had a good stop and then we just gave up three oftens everyone in a row and that wasn't the town that we wanted to set and you know we kind of on the offensive for some things tried to press some of it offensively who were patient we wanted to be patient we came down here taken quick shots we didn't want to play up and down game with them because you know we turn around played monday
222.12,234.39, you know we want to work work the ball around more and be able to drive the aggressive and take it to the basket and actually winesburg did exactly what we wanted to do against that so

1371.24,1388.16, you did go to an out the bugle it how the team hasn't proved since then and how you looking to bounce back from that you know a place themselves hard to say how much they improved since that was our last game you know were getting ready to start again so we haven't seen him in gay action yet
1388.22,1398.63, i think the loss itself are just that day let's call one bad day hopefully put some fire in them and now you know what we have to do from start to 
1398.75,1402.53, the team deftly graduating better through the season
1402.56,1405.41, you mentioned with the winning streak
1405.56,1412.43, the blame anything and it's no excuse but i think we forgot how to lose and you know once we lost one in the play of
1412.67,1415.88, i just turned a corner in the negative way
1415.88,1422.96, we need to learn how to be the most important thing this year is just the one game at a time and losses are going to happen
1422.96,1433.25, you know if we were going to be the winning street was probably the worst thing that could have happened to us you know a couple of losses in there that we could overcome my now but in the play of
1433.43,1446.72, else the tea also struggled a lot with last year with shoulder injuries now how do you see the incantatur ne dealing with those last is an wemaining every team does the injuries and we certainly had our share
1446.75,1456.77, but they overcame i mean the ones that we had i have you know give credit that we had some death last year so when the injuries occur people stepped right up and write in
1456.8,1487.25, so it didn't really hinder us much as a team and the people that were indeed did a great job of getting themselves back and right now and not on wood we seem good to go but you never know but they you know obviously injuries are always going to be an issue throughout the season is just how people step up and over for them no talking about death coming into this season you did lose senior pitcher amber force and a how do you look to fill that second picture spot
1487.34,1507.11, we have a lot of options which is a great thing we have no abbey reynard and junior emily westfall who both i think are ready to step in and take that spot i have a couple of freshmen so that we look for a look too
1507.23,1509.03, so they're going to be
1509.15,1511.64, you know working with each other to
1511.67,1527.69, she steps up knows that but that being said we're hoping that's not a big downfall having lost amberleys about you now some fresh actually pretty excited about talk about the recruiting process this all season you know who you're excited to watch
1527.99,1548.27, what does recruit the freshman at herne this year well we have a good group the recruiting process goes year round as you know so you don't you get to see them in high school and then through their summer ball and now they're in your programme
1548.3,1567.44, any cothope that their team cortes denounce is by all means but that's not always the case you need those freshmen a step up pushed the upper classmen and we have four of em in here now and like i said two of them are pitchers we have to speed and the other ones and a stick it gives us that
1567.56,1582.53, looking for them to be ready to go should those injuries occur and you know we don't ever want to miss a beat whether it's a senior in their freshmen so were open they prepare themselves and they are and they battener to the team for short
1582.98,1598.13, yes'm sure you definitely very excited they are returning this year or sophomore short cut elliman really had a shoulder surgery over the all season and your starting picture jasmin roar no wire these girls so important to this payment house kildonan wished
1598.19,1650.99, about cayley first but yes she actually had a portable arm which is odd because she the right in a throw or not usually what causes it i will say what we believe it is she swings like crazy and always you mentioned her batting average in what he did for us in the team she swing so hard that i think that we believe that's what caused the tear and neat the left arm which is a good thing as far as being right or left but i she got the surgery over the summer rehoboam she looked a hundred per cent right now so i don't i don't think she's going to missinaba as jazz in austrasia year from a division to school and stepped right in and you know let us as far as the pitching situation and obviously be a good rule model for that pirouetted
1650.99,1680.3, a second picture is a mast or stab some one ready to go for the second game so does will be a good example to them what it takes work wise and i want to take this far as what the pitch that team cause they're going to face the same team chaussees a giant benefit having that having her come back so so you are intentness as he cotherstone as he came done anything different this alan or is doing anything
1680.3,1682.82, reason differently from previous years
1682.94,1684.41, well
1684.59,1698.27, one i have a new assistant coach and every time a new system coach comes in they bring new ideas and you love that that's why you do it and arsinoe always work with the weight lifting program
1698.36,1724.88, a sense but she worked well well with casselthorpe staff as far as putting in a different type on lifting program in the players seem to enjoy it in their working hard and unseeing results with it i think they are too and it's a little more fun than little more energetic and so i think they've seen that difference as far as the open with outside of that
1725.27,1740.39, a lot more of them in the gym on their own in the cages working out that might go back to that lost in the play of that bad day because like i said to bad taste in your mouth so their daughter good job will like less matutta happen again
1740.48,1751.49, down the leadership to show the young one is as well it takes an oasis every year the team goes on a florida trip talk about a little bit about what that trip does for human lives so important
1751.58,1803.75, it's it's extremely important and not only you know the main reason is to get out of this weather for us been seventy this week so i could pay her but that's the main reason every one thinks you go and just think it's by far not that we get the play ten games down there the good thing about where we go is they usually tried to match against regional teams from a peroration as ohio indiana illinois we have an opportunity to go play them here to get the plane down there and were plain some top notch teams so the game do count the count in your national ranking all your stationery thing so they're not like exhibition games here so we were still trying to win but one year out you get to finally be outside playing it does give me an opportunity to try people indifference without that you know important being a game
1803.75,1810.41, people use step up or step down down there and it's a real place for them the show case themselves
1810.71,1828.08, it andian obviously you put females in you know one pace at one time they get to know each other fairly well so i think it's a good team landing thing also so it helps in so many ways and then when you give back the season goes so quickly that that's the best way to get it started
1828.08,1839.15, i'm sure you're very very excited for the coming season i'm sure a lot of fans at west musicale or as well as can be all the time we have to day when again this was janet running her head soft boot
1839.15,1848.06, west monticello and pleasure in the players it thank you that's going to be all for this coach as corner this season thanks for joining us once again
